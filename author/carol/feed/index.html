<p><b></b><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03.jpg" alt="Electric fireplace in modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52578 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

			<h2>Here&#8217;s what influences full-home renovation costs in NYC — from permits and construction to hidden costs</h2>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</a> and NYC <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten general contractors, the typical price range for an entire home remodel in NYC is <b>$100 to $200 per square foot (psf)</b>. </span><span class="s1">This standard starting range includes both labor and materials, and represents costs averaged across both “wet” spaces, like <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">bathrooms</span></a> and<a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"> kitchens</span></a>, and “dry” spaces, like living rooms, bedrooms, and offices. This is because wet space remodels tend to be far more expensive per square foot, with a higher density of materials, finishes, and specialized labor (think plumbing, tiling, and more). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a more specific breakdown of typical NYC home renovation costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">

<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Wet spaces: Baths start at<b> $400 psf; </b>kitchens start at <b>$300 psf</b> </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100–$200 psf</b> </span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Non-gut remodel with stock materials:<b> $100 psf</b> </span></li>

<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Structural changes, extensive customization:<b> $300 psf </b>and<b> up</b> </span></li>

<p><span class="s1"><b>Scheduling tip:</b> Don&#8217;t wait. There&#8217;s a backlog in the supply of construction materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/">schedule and sign with a contractor</a> to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The cost for a gut renovation vs. a non-gut</span></h3>
<p class="p1">As you <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan out your home remodel</a>, there’s a difference in cost, process, and scope between a gut and non-gut project. <span class="s1">In a gut renovation, interior walls are stripped down to the studs or knocked out entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A gut will start at the higher end of the <b>$100 </b>to<b> $200 psf </b>range, while a renovation in which you redo the space within the existing walls will be on the lower end. For example, in a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, a renovation will come in around the <b>$50,000</b> to <b>$70,000</b> range, while a gut renovation will likely exceed <b>$100,000</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The non-gut renovation may involve a new kitchen and bath, as well as refinishing flooring, replastering and <span class="s2">painting</span>, plus upgrades in materials and finishes. The gut renovation will include the above as well as replacing the walls and flooring, and possibly installing new piping and wiring systems and moving doorways.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49030 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation costs" width="1000" height="745" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GutOrNoGutReno-1-600x447.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given that New York City apartments vary widely and can present unique challenges, a per-square-foot estimate is really a ballpark figure for you to get started. Here’s an overview:</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Basic costs for an NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When estimating price per square foot, the scope of work usually includes the following:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Basic demolition </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Framing: the skeletal, load-bearing structure to which the interior walls and other systems are attached </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Insulation and drywall </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Wiring, including outlets and switches </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Plumbing </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heating/cooling systems </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">All visible materials and fixtures in kitchens and baths (described below) </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t include appliances. Also bear in mind that the choices you make for visible materials—tile, flooring, millwork, paint, lighting fixtures, electronics, and more—can significantly affect the price of your renovation.</span></p>
<h4>At the $100 to $200 psf range:</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Materials are generally prefabricated or stock items and in finishes that are available at common retail outlets. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Cabinets in this price range are typically MDF (medium-density fiberboard). </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Tiling will run under <b>$10</b> <b>psf</b>. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Lighting will be standard but solid basics. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Solid wood floors may be shorter, narrower planks made of less expensive woods. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">The work will be careful, clean, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/home-remodel-bay-ridge-brooklyn-pre-war-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-installed at this level</a> with higher quality labor and skillsets at the upper end of the range. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">At <b>$200</b> to <b>$300</b> <b>psf </b>range:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Some customization on details such as joints, millwork, and hardware</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets are custom or semi-custom and can include built-ins. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countertops in natural stone or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-quality manufactured materials.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> Solid, wide-planked hardwood flooring</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Projects at this price point are not usually gut renovations, but rather remodels that focus on the space within the existing walls.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">One thing to note</span><span class="s1">: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote</span><span class="s5">.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">What you’ll get for <b>$300 per square foot</b> and higher:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>$300</b> <b>psf</b> or above will usually pay for layout changes or structural work, such as <span class="s3">combining apartments</span>. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving walls, adding staircases, shifting gas and plumbing, and electrical rewiring all contribute to a higher per-square-foot cost, as well as add to the behind-the-scenes expenditures (more on that below). </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Since pricing for kitchens and baths runs higher than other rooms, more of those equal a higher price per square foot. For example, renovating a 1,000-square-foot apartment that has three bathrooms will be more expensive than an apartment of the same size with just one bathroom.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this level and beyond, you can expect to see more extensive customization, fine finishes, and luxurious materials. This includes handmade tile, exotic wood grains, natural stone, and custom millwork details that complement the home’s architecture. You might also see custom door casements and extensive lighting details.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on your general contractor and your level of involvement in the project, you may also want or need professional design services. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may need an architect. Architect approvals are required any time you make changes to the structure or to plumbing or gas lines. Many Sweeten general <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in NYC</a> can refer architects for your project.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">You may consider a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">design/build firm</span></a>, which combines design and construction services within one fee and contract. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Building and city requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a co-op or condo building, you’ll likely need to submit your plans drawn by an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">architect</span></a> to your building’s board. Co-ops are generally stricter about renovations than condo buildings, though many condos are now adopting more stringent rules as well. Buildings may also have minimum requirements for construction insurance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some alteration agreements require a security deposit to cover potential damage. They may also include the fees incurred by the condo or co-op board to review and approve your plan. You may find that contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive specifications have higher rates in order to meet higher insurance requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NYC Department of Buildings requires that you obtain permits and inspections for many types of construction work, including plumbing, electrical, and structural. Permits can add up. An electrical permit can run close to <b>$900</b>, plumbing permits can cost from under <b>$2,000</b> to <b>$5,000</b>, and an asbestos inspection can be <b>$500</b>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Demolition and site prep</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the state of the original space, you may need to do extensive preparatory work after demolition and before installation. Older apartments will almost always require stripping, leveling, and plastering. Uneven floors and walls must be leveled before cabinets can be hung, doors framed, or tiling installed. These costs are determined by the general contractor once they have a chance to examine your space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Behind-the-scenes costs</span></h4>
<p>Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as t<span class="s1">he main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts, from what we have seen,&#8221; said an NYC Sweeten contractor. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compared to costs for the &#8220;visible&#8221; parts of your renovation, pricing for the &#8220;unseen” costs can be difficult to anticipate. While labor is a clear one, keep in mind that different forms of labor can be priced very differently. Wiring and plumbing work, for example, tend to be expensive. And over the past year, master plumbers and electricians have seen costs go up, “primarily due to the safety measures and certifications that have been imposed on these trades by the Department of Buildings,” said <span class="s3">Sweeten</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">NYC general contractor Aaron</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plumbing generally runs between <b>$1,500</b> to <b>$2,000</b> per fixture in New York City. So, prepare for at least <b>$5,000</b> for a licensed plumber to run new lines for a sink, toilet, and bathtub. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Skim coating,</span></a><span class="s3"> a technique</span> that smoothes a wall, hiding all imperfections, is the most expensive type of labor. In some cases, it can be more affordable to tear down old walls and put up new drywall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider that from the contractor’s perspective, “labor” on the budget proposal may include not only the hourly rate they pay their workers, but also insurance, license, and other overhead fees that keep their business running. (Contractors typically take home 10-15% profit. For example, if they do $2 million worth of business this year, they are netting about $200k.) Insurances and other costs of running a business increase year over year, and while the costs are not passed 1:1 to the client, contractors must raise prices to maintain operations. Some show a specific line on the budget for profit/overhead, while others build it into other budget lines.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Tips on how to budget your NYC home renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you’ve accounted for each line item in your budget, allocate an additional 10 to 15 percent as a cushion. Projects can run over budget as a result of unforeseen circumstances, so it’s good to err on the safe side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many factors go into the per-square-foot estimates. Trying to come up with a plan to match your budget? Here are some tips from contractors and renovating homeowners:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mix high and low.</b> This refers to materials, which should be selected for maximum impact. You may choose a handmade tile for the kitchen backsplash while sticking to an off-the-shelf option for the second bath. Make a custom statement where it will really get noticed, and use standard materials where it won’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Don’t skimp on plumbing and electrical infrastructure.</b> Although these aspects probably won’t get you many compliments at a dinner party, you still need licensed and qualified experts for these jobs. If you don’t, there may be expensive problems to deal with in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Focus on kitchens and baths.</b> Spend your money here! A <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen upgrade</a> and a refreshed bathroom have the most resale value impact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Consult experts upfront.</b> If you are inclined to hire an architect or designer for a major transformation, get them on board early. This can save money by mapping out a clear plan, helping you avoid costly changes mid-stream. Set aside 15 to 20 percent of your budget for this professional. In general, hiring licensed professionals early is a cost-effective way to prevent insurance headaches later on by using their expertise to avoid mistakes that can lead to delays.</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s1"></span></a></p>

			<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639032991721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u><strong><u>How much does a gut renovation cost in New York City?</u></strong></u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">An average full-home renovation in NYC will cost between $100-200 per square foot. A gut renovation will start at the higher end of the $100-$200 psf range. “Wet spaces” with plumbing have higher gut costs: kitchens will cost, on average, $300 per square foot, and bathrooms, $400 psf. Gut renovating dry spaces without plumbing will cost between $30–$50 psf.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033036055"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in NYC?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The visible parts of a bathroom—tile, sinks, vanities, tubs/showers—will directly impact end costs, as will the type of work being done (gut renovation vs. rip-and-replace.) In New York City, a budget remodel of a bathroom will start at $600 psf; or $21,000 for a 35 square-foot space. Mid-grade bathrooms start at $700 psf, or $24,500 for a 35 square-foot space. High-end remodels will start at $850 psf, or $68,000 for an 80 square-foot space.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639033047979"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What renovations increase NYC home value the most?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Kitchen and bathroom renovations have the most resale value in NYC homes. Even doing a more budget-friendly “rip-and-replace” renovation (where old appliances and cabinets are swapped out for new ones, with no changes made to the room layout,) can lead to returns when selling in the competitive NYC housing market.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagining your dream kitchen is easy; budgeting for it is complicated. If you&#8217;re planning a kitchen remodel, we&#8217;ll help you understand your options, and offer guidance on major expenses and hidden costs you may encounter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From building requirements to permits and design, here are the average kitchen renovation costs to expect in NYC. These figures are broken out by finish level, and are based on Sweeten renovations: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$25,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$35,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$65,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Start planning your kitchen renovation now. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it’s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor’s calendar. Waiting could lead to longer delays, and even more severe price inflation on materials.</span> <em><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—at no cost to you.</span></em></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">From budget to high-end kitchen appliances and finishes </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Appliances, fixtures, and finishing materials all lie on a spectrum, whether you&#8217;re doing a budget kitchen remodel or a high-end one. Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Budget” kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Mid-grade” kitchen materials balance cost with quality. Examples include engineered wood flooring and products from GE, Caesarstone, Kohler, or Benjamin Moore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“High-end” kitchen materials prioritize quality over cost. Products include hardwood flooring or marble, and brands like Bertazzoni, Ann Sacks, and Farrow &amp; Ball. This category may also include special materials sourced from overseas suppliers, and fully custom fabrications.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A note about cabinetry: In high-end kitchens that feature custom millwork, the cabinetry often accounts for a high percentage of both materials and labor costs. The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000</b> per linear foot. There are many other factors—drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options.

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Kitchen renovation costs for permits, design, and behind-the-scenes items</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The average kitchen remodel costs are comprised of both visible and invisible items. Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building boards / HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.</span></p>
<h4>City permits</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 –</b> <b>$3,500. </b> Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 –</b> <b>$5,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500</b> – <b>$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City’s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building’s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.</span></p>
<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000</b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you’ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">These “soft costs”—expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen—can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

<h4>Demolition and site prep</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the site prep stage, your general contractor needs to do significant work behind the scenes to ensure that your kitchen renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of—this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000</b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.</span></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation—if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the “general construction” or “labor” budget and be handled by your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s6">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span class="s1"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. “Insurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors—especially plumbers—have seen an increase in their costs.” This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be “more eyes on the project.” Additionally, he mentions, “Buildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.”</span></p>
<h4>Raw material costs</h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC</h3>
<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room’s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city’s permitting process, or with permission from your building’s board. </span></p>
<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ll be changing the kitchen’s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you’ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll almost certainly need approval from the building’s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they’ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget. </span></p>
<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?

For L.A. homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. Additionally, you’ll want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up, and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling costs per square foot in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that Los Angeles is one of the pricier real estate markets in the United States. However, the housing stock in the area is fairly new. As a result, L.A. homes won’t experience behind-the-wall issues that are often found in older structures. Kitchens and baths are the most popular renovation types. Exterior upgrades and garage conversions are also on the rise to create additional living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process in a whole house</a>, on average, many of our projects can range from </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$400+</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. Typically, dry rooms (i.e., living rooms and bedrooms) are cheaper to renovate than wet rooms (i.e., kitchen and baths), and is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated that while <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating living rooms or bedrooms</a>—dry rooms—are at the lower end of the range, the wet rooms are closer to </span><b>$400</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>
<h3>Interior designer costs in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also checked in with L.A.-based</span><a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interior designer Haley Weidenbaum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how interior designers calculate fees. She explains, “Typically for renovation projects, I will charge a flat fee. This is beneficial for both designer and client. It allows the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designer to work</a> more freely and offers more transparency between the designer and the client. However, it is important for both parties to agree on a scope of work. Everyone should be on the same page and understand what is included under this flat fee.”</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles kitchen remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing for a kitchen remodel</a>, remember that California banned the running of new gas lines to any new construction—which means no gas stoves. This move is essential in the lowering of the carbon footprint. Even though buildings with existing gas lines aren’t affected, be sure to check the latest codes. If you’re looking to renovate for resale, you don’t want to invest in appliances that aren’t in compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics of storage and delivery make the cost of cabinets in L.A. less expensive than more densely populated urban areas. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><b>$24,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 square feet. The finishes would be budget-friendly from retailers such as Home Depot. This budget includes budget finishes, energy-efficient appliances, laminate countertops, and mid-grade sink and faucet finishes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade kitchen remodeling costs: We have seen Sweeten project costs come in at </span><b>$37,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this budget, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refreshing a kitchen</a> can include new stock or semi-custom cabinets, appliances, and manufactured or quartz countertops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end kitchen: Projects on the higher end of the scale can start at <strong>$76,000</strong>. A large part of that cost can be in custom cabinetry. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5589#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimate that a high-end renovation averages upwards of </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles bathroom remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget bathroom: A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget bathroom renovation</a> at 35 square feet, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, starts at </span><b>$18,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can reach </span><b>$25,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Sweeten contractors. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom in Los Angeles</a> will cost on average between </span><b>$28,500</b><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to the Cost vs. Value Report, the cost is </span><b>$849</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or <strong>$29,744</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. All fixtures are replaced featuring solid-surface vanity and integrated sink, recessed medicine cabinet with light, ceramic tile floor, and a 30” x 60” tub.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end bathroom: The average cost Sweeten contractors report working on for upscale bathrooms start around </span><b>$40,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Cost vs Value Report puts a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at </span><b>$88,491. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is based on a bathroom expanded from 35 to 100 square feet. It worked out to be </span><b>$770</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the highest budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per piece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. As a result, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good general contractor can work</a> with a reasonable budget and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for the bath remodel</a>.</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles master suite addition costs</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$503</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$193,390</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can build a 24’ x 16’ master suite including a walk-in closet, dressing area, freestanding tub, separate shower, and double vanity over an existing crawl space, according to Cost v. Value Report. This pricing includes carpeting in the bedroom and tile on the bathroom floor, lighting throughout, and an exhaust fan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crawl space and a raised foundation make it easier for the crew to crawl underneath the subfloor to access the rough connections. It becomes more challenging and expensive when working on a renovation with a house on a slab on grade. If fixtures are being relocated or saw cuts, trenching, and backfill are required, then these can add to the cost of the renovation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upscale master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$606</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf, or </span><b>$388,427</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s possible to create a 32’ x 20’ master suite with a separate sitting area and a large master bath, also over crawl space, according to the Cost v. Value Report. This includes custom shelving and built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows. The bath has everything that is included in a mid-grade remodel, along with stone counters and a partitioned space for a toilet. The suite also features a wet bar with microwave, sink, and refrigerator for this budget range.</span></li>

<h3>How much do Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) cost in Los Angeles?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ADU is a secondary housing unit on a single-family residential lot. They tend to be adjacent to a primary housing unit, and are usually much smaller than the average home. You can learn more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building ADUs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as the numerous new laws passed in 2016 and 2019 that are encouraging their proliferation in California by making them faster, easier, and more efficient to build.</span></p>
<h4>Existing electrical and plumbing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractors</a> have worked on projects that range from about <strong>$50,000</strong> to over <strong>$200,000</strong>, depending on whether they are conversions or ground-up constructions. There are numerous other factors that come into play. Importantly, what you have to work with is key—are you converting an existing structure that has electrical and/or plumbing? If so, it could be a relatively affordable proposition. Sweeten contractors Anna &amp; Vahik tell us that in Los Angeles County, conversions average about <strong>$75,000</strong> while ground-up constructions start at a range between <strong>$125,000</strong> to <strong>$150,000</strong>.</span></p>
<h4>Converting garages</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specifics of an ADU conversion will cause a wide variance in the costs associated with bringing it to compliance. Some Sweeten contractors have been able to convert garages to ADUs with a <strong>$58,000 </strong>budget, which already had plumbing (sewer) and its own electrical service. Another old garage was completely converted costing about <strong>$196,000</strong>. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for remodeling permits in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Los Angeles. However, typically the cost will be determined by your budget and require a bit of high school math to figure out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sweeten contractors in L.A., this number varies between an estimated </span><b>$750</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the specific scope of work for each project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik explains, “Permit costs vary for different neighborhoods. Average kitchen and bath remodels (“express permits”) with no structural changes or layout changes cost around </span><b>$500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bigger projects such as additions, remodels with structural changes, or exterior work that need plan changes start at </span><b>$5,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can go up to </span><b>$20,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities like Santa Monica.”</span></p>

<h3>Laying out the plan for high ceilings</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners closed on an 850-square-foot loft apartment in a multi-building complex in Greenwich Village, just a short stroll from Washington Square Park. The building dated to 1890 and had formerly housed a cast-iron factory. The apartment itself benefited from the structure’s history with high 16-foot ceilings and original detailing. The interior finishes were outdated, however, since it had been decades since the last renovation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47451" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg" alt="loft homeowner" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Portrait-25-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They planned to convert the one-bedroom apartment into a two-bedroom while making full use of the ceiling height. A mezzanine level around much of the apartment would allow for storage and display of their art and decorative pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen was tucked away in a dark corner of the loft, with dark wood cabinetry and black countertops adding to the gloom. It made more sense to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap the locations of the bathroom</a> and the kitchen. This brought the kitchen closer to the the dining and living spaces. The bathroom itself needed a gut renovation. Its finish materials and all the wiring and plumbing were deteriorating.</span></p>

<h3>Out with the debris, in with the light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As their Sweeten contractor began to demo the space, he unearthed&#8230;actual earth. The contractor found about eight inches of “some kind of dirt floor” beneath the flooring. He had to excavate it along with the rest of the demolition debris—a first for this seasoned contractor. He speculated it was perhaps due to the building’s past as a factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They worked to create a gallery-like space featuring bright white walls, highlighted with blackened steel accents. Keeping the finishes simple allowed the airiness of the space to shine.</span></p>

<h3>A triumph of clerestory windows</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there are now two bedrooms rather than one, the homeowners were able to preserve a sense of expansiveness by not taking the walls all the way up to the ceiling. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clear glass clerestory windows</a> were installed</span><span class="s1"> in the bedrooms, as well as in the bathroom so that natural light could still shine in each part of the renovated loft. </span></p>
<h3>An integrated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the hallways, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, a steel rail was installed for a custom library ladder, to give access to the mezzanine areas. This unique system used brushed steel for the rail and brackets, and black-anodized aluminum for the portable ladder, to make it light enough to carry from room to room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Storage-12-scaled.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the living room lost a few feet to create the second bedroom, it gained plenty of linear feet in display storage as a result of the loft renovation. Custom black steel bookcases run along the length of one wall. The contractor secured these shelves through to the studs as they were rebuilding the apartment, so they&#8217;ll be able to handle any load. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The living room space opens up to the dining nook, which also houses an upright piano. An <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g2262/gallery-wall-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjacent gallery wall</a>, decorated with black-framed art, provides visual interest along the interior wall. Recessed lighting and statement pendants support the minimalist aesthetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47429" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bedroom-21-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg" alt="library ladder" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-GuestRoom-02-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<h3>Extra storage for the bathroom</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the smaller bedroom next to the kitchen, they created a lofted sleeping area for guests with a simple mattress set-up, which is also accessible via the library ladder. The elevated sleeping loft allows the floor area of the room to be used by the homeowners as a closet and dressing area. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47427" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg" alt="loft bed" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bed-Loft-26-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47452" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel" width="1707" height="2560" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Rain-Shower-24-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom received a similarly modern treatment with a deep soaking tub. A matte black towel hook and shower and sink fixtures create contrast, and match the overall black-and-white motif. Unusually, the homeowners were able to add storage above the shower area, also accessible with the portable library ladder. As with the overhead kitchen storage, the space above was built without shelves or compartments, to accommodate large or odd-shaped items. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple now has a beautiful home that handles their storage, showcases their art and treasures, lets in the light—and even lets them share their space with overnight guests.  </span></p>

A full-service design/build general contracting firm can also offer comprehensive architectural services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">After your plans are complete, you will use them to find a general contractor that meets your needs. If your project requires an architect, your <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor may also be able to refer one. </span><span class="s1">The most successful projects will use an architect and contractor that have worked together before and complement each other’s work.</span></p><p class="p5">Here, <span class="s2">we</span> lay out the full details on when your project will need an architect and how much you should expect to pay. <span class="s1">Our vetted contractors can help homeowners access different levels of architectural services and architects. </span></p><h3 class="p5">You’ll need an architect when the DOB requires signed plans</h3><p class="p5">First, your city/building may require you to use one. Are you are making any significant changes that require the involvement of your Department of Buildings? If so, then you&#8217;ll need an architect to make applications and pull permits. As architect Shannon Reid of <a href="https://rwa.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Reid Wilson Architects</span></a> told us, “<span class="s4">Each jurisdiction has a clear delineation on what types of projects require a licensed professional to sign and seal the drawings. NYC is more restrictive than most, and homeowners may find an architect is required due to DOB regulations.” </span></p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if the remodel affects walls, electrical, and plumbing</h3><p class="p8"><span class="s5">“</span>An architect is generally required when a remodel requires the removing or relocation of walls,” as architect John Kim of <a href="http://kmystudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Kimoy Studios</span></a> told us.</p><p class="p8">If walls are being moved, your remodel will likely “affect plumbing counts or locations,” and require city, as well as co-op/condo board approvals, as architect Steven Harper of <a href="https://www.mndpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">MNDPC</span></a> explained.</p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if you want a professional to manage the project</h3><p class="p8">According to Shannon, “Architects often act as owner’s representatives during the construction phase.” Also, “&#8230;during construction, the architect follows the project to make sure the contractor is following the drawings and the end result is what the homeowner has approved.&#8221;</p><p class="p8">All that said, “architects are essentially professional problem solvers, so any remodel or modification could benefit from the advice or services an architect can offer,” said architect Steven.</p><h3 class="p10">What services do architects offer?</h3><p class="p5">Given the scale of these types of projects, the money spent on architectural services is worth it! One key benefit: architects will project-manage the remodel from start to finish. This is ideal for busy homeowners or those new to remodeling. Additionally, architects use their training to create an optimal and thoughtful design to suit your lifestyle. This guarantees that your new space suits your needs perfectly.</p><p class="p10">When you hire an architect, you can opt for a full suite of services. This includes the following:</p><p><img decoding="async" title="hire-architect-project-graph" class="alignnone wp-image-31023 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg" alt="when to hire an architect project graph" width="1032" height="552" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg 1032w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-300x160.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p><h3 class="p10">How much does an architect cost?</h3><p class="p5">That sounds great, you say! But how much will it cost? For residential remodels, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. In major urban areas like New York City, this is typically between 15-20 percent for a project costing under $100,000. Large or costly projects budgeted above $250,000 or more can sometimes be billed at a lower percentage, between 10-15 percent.</p><p class="p5">When it comes to permit fees or application fees, they are either required fixed fees or are based on the cost of construction. <span class="s6">These vary based on location but in general, once a project is under construction, additional fees might be paid to the Department of Buildings.</span> Expect fees if you change the plans and the application needs to be amended, or if the construction time is extended.</p><p class="p11"><span class="s8">The cost of an expediter is often minimal when working with the Department of Buildings in towns outside city limits (you don’t usually need one). </span>It’s not uncommon to be able to walk into the buildings department of smaller towns and obtain the information you’re looking for without an expediter.</p><p class="p5">Some architects may charge a fixed rate, an hourly rate, or a cost per square foot. However, these fee structures are less common for full-service residential remodel projects.</p><h3 class="p10">Can I hire an architect for standalone services?</h3><p class="p5">If you do not plan to do a gut remodel, it doesn’t make sense to pay for the full package. However, there are certain situations where you may need an architect for just one part of your project. For example, if <span class="s9">your building requires schematic designs</span> by a registered architect (RA), for a fairly small bathroom project.</p><p class="p5">For those who are willing to provide one-off services, you will typically work out an hourly billing arrangement. Alternately, they may <span class="s10">charge a flat rate based on the time needed to complete it. </span>Some architects do not charge for initial consultations. If they do, they&#8217;ll apply that cost towards the project total if you award the project to them.</p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Depending on their experience and seniority, a project manager&#8217;s hourly rate will range between $100 to $150. For a principal RA, expect $175 to $250. You can also request a cap on the hourly rate if you need to stay within budget. </span></p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Architect Steven told us that </span>they typically offer “pre-design services for a modest fee (fixed cost, not hourly) that would include—among other things—a site visit, code review, preliminary budget and schedule estimates, and feasibility. This fee is credited against the fee for our full services if we proceed with a project. However, the deliverables can just as easily be used to engage with another firm if that is a better fit.”</p><p>Do you need an architect for your project? We match homeowners—for free—with design-build firms that offer architectural services. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best vetted contractors</span></a>.</span></p><p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46403 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Image of a clickable button to Post A Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p><h3>More popular questions</h3>					</div>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With an abundance of Pinterest boards and design blogs, it’s easy to imagine how your dream NYC bathroom could look. If you&#8217;re ready to turn those daydreams into reality, the first crucial step is creating a bathroom remodel budget. To get you started, <span class="s2">Sweeten</span></span><span class="s1"> offers a roadmap of elements that will impact the cost of a bathroom remodel in New York City. Sweeten&#8217;s guide to bathroom remodeling costs, covering building requirements, permits, and design will help nail down your scope and better align real costs with a realistic budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in NYC</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take a look at the overall average cost to remodel a bathroom in New York City, based on Sweeten renovations:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Budget remodel: Starting at <b>$600 </b>psf (per square feet) or <b>$21,000</b> (based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700 </b>psf or <b>$24,500 </b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850 </b>psf or <b>$68,000 </b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it can be tempting to apply à la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you’ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you’ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How much will materials for a bathroom remodel cost?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Wall and floor tile</b>: Budget – <b>$3 per square foot (psf)</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$15 psf</b>, High-end – <b>$35 psf</b> </span></li>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.</span></p>
<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">alteration agreements</span></a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Thomas</a></span><span class="s1"> explained, “Buildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.” The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands. </span></p>
<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 – $3,500</b> and higher </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as<b> $5,000</b> per permit </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City’s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as <b>$5,000</b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 </b>and<b> $3,500</b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900</b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b>.</span></p>
<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">approval process</span></a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub/shower, and lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000</strong>. This is because you’ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project’s construction costs for his or her fee.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.</p>
<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor’s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building’s “stack” (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600</b> to<b> $900</b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000</b>). This is critical for the project’s foundation alignment and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGL_uAFyKzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you’ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Aaron</a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. </span><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<h4><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;bathroom remodeling new york&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:577,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Bathroom remodeling costs in New York in 2021</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials. Knowing what impacts cost during a bathroom renovation will allow you to better align your budget while avoiding surprises. </span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353756989"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">NYC bathroom renovations typically cost between $600 and $850 per square foot, depending on the level of fixtures and materials used. The finish level available from big-box stores like Home Depot and Ikea will put your renovation at the low end of the price range. Custom, hand-made, and imported specialty materials will push you to the high end.</p>

<h3>Improve layout and impersonal lighting</h3>
<p>The kitchen in Dawn and David’s loft apartment was not ideally configured. After living in the home for a dozen years, the pair decided to finally redo the kitchen. The cabinets had seen a lot of wear and tear, and appliances and drawers were not in the best positions.</p>
<p>The couple also wanted to fix a prior renovat<span style="color: #333333;">ion mistake:</span> a contractor had convinced them to go with recessed lighting in the kitchen and living room areas. Dawn found the choice too commercial and wanted to find statement pendants with a bit more character. The couple also wanted to add personal touches, like a Moroccan-style tile backsplash.</p>
<h3>Make the kitchen&#8217;s storage function smarter</h3>
<p>The goal was to borrow square footage from the kitchen to give more breathing room to the dining and living room areas. They&#8217;d create more kitchen counter space and cabinet storage but within a smaller footprint. An efficient layout would be key. She said, “We wanted to get the most out of each nook and cranny while not ending up with a lot of nooks and crannies!”</p>
<p>Given their penchant for entertaining, large serving pieces and other odd-shaped items needed specific spots. To accomplish this, Dawn “spent a lot of time measuring the things that&#8217;d go into storage and were plotted out correctly in the kitchen. I was careful not to over-allocate space.”</p>

<p>An expanded <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula with drawers</a> on either side—facing the kitchen as well as the entryway—was a key part of executing this vision. Dawn wanted “tons of room for prepping and cooking a meal as well as serving space for hors d&#8217;oeuvres when we entertain. People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner. With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</p>

<h3>Focal point: A yellow Moroccan tile backsplash</h3>
<p>They created dedicated space for serving trays and her largest pots. A good deal of thought went into the best placement of appliances and cabinets; the utensil drawer faces the dishwasher, while the speed oven is hidden in the peninsula keeping the countertops clear.</p>
<p>Dawn also worked with her Sweeten contractor to add a full-length pantry that had both interior drawers and shelves. A <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/clean-and-organize/creative-spice-storage-ideas-pictures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice rack mounted</a> at eye level sits inside of the door.</p>
<p>For the finishes, Dawn, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://arcadiahomeinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arcadia Home</a>, an artisan-made home accessories brand, had a vision: “grainy flat-paneled cabinets, beautiful organic pulls, extraordinary color in the backsplash, killer lighting, and a fairly clean white but interesting countertop.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10251-Dawn-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Large silver pendant lighting over counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-56952 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10251-Dawn-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10251-Dawn-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10251-Dawn-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

Now, the peninsula sports two handmade pierced nickel-plated brass shades from Egypt. The light from the pierced holes creates a unique pattern when illuminated. The centerpiece of the entire kitchen was the yellow Moroccan tile, inspired by a yellow Moroccan rug in the couple’s living room—a purchase from their first trip together during their dating days. “It makes us happy every day,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A step-by-step guide and timeline for a one-bedroom apartment renovation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32172 size-full" title="brick-wall-blue-white-couch" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg" alt="brick wall in living room with blue and white couches and a blue rug after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Should you renovate in stages or all at once?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve covered the expected timelines for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovations</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath renovations</a>, but <strong>how long does an entire apartment renovation take?</strong> Since bathrooms and kitchens are usually the most time-intensive spaces to redo, the timeline for renovating a one-bedroom apartment is not much longer. Another bonus: the more spaces there are, the more opportunity there is to implement economies of scale and to multi-task! This approach allows you to save both time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re considering spacing out several projects (for budgetary reasons), you should consider doing them all at once. While it’s a larger sum upfront, it’ll likely be a better value for your money. For example, while you’re waiting for your cabinets to arrive, your contractor can paint the bedroom or install baseboards. Also, consider the cost– and time–effectiveness in using the permits and crew already scheduled for your project for a full scope rather than securing them multiple times.</p>
<h3>General timeframe for a one-bedroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, size and complexity determine how long an entire apartment renovation will take. If you aren&#8217;t moving walls or changing electrical or plumbing, your apartment renovation will be on the shorter side. <strong>On average, you should allocate about three to five months for on-site work in a top-to-bottom one-bedroom apartment renovation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline:</strong><strong> Pre-Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p>While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, there is a lot to be done before then. Here are the details on each box you&#8217;ll need to check before breaking ground on the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</strong></h4>
<p>Many homeowners are in-contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. If this is you, don&#8217;t worry: there&#8217;s a way to get it all done. As one <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post explains, you should wait until you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed on the property</a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry—wait until you’ve at least signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 2: Post your renovation project on Sweeten (5 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;re in contract, or if you already own your apartment, you can post your project to Sweeten and <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin soliciting bids</a>. Add the details about the space you want to renovate, your inspiration photos (optional but useful for our matchmakers), and any other information that would help us find your perfect contractors. We&#8217;ll connect you with 3-5 of our trusted, vetted contractors who are a good fit for your project. </p>
<h4><strong>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve previewed the Sweeten contractors&#8217; profiles, and have decided you&#8217;d like to set up a meeting(s), our online scheduler will give you a two-week window to mark your available dates for a site visit. Both you and the contractor(s)  will receive an email confirming your available times, by which the contractor(s) will reach out to you to confirm a date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An on-site visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and limitations of the space, and for the two of you to see if you hit it off! (This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> is a useful read for understanding the key info necessary to secure the most accurate bid.) After you schedule your on-site visit, check out our blog post about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to prepare</a> for the meeting. You should expect a written bid within 5-10 business days after your visit.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast! This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primer</a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with a Sweeten project advisor to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 5: Sign the contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an estimated timeline for completion, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps where hiccups or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delays might occur</a>, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and board approvals have held up many a renovation, but don’t be daunted: our experts are well-versed in navigating these processes and can advise you on how best to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you’re moving plumbing or gas lines, you’ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals, but you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure that everything is up to code.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and warn yours that a renovation is beginning imminently. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight! It doesn’t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline</strong><strong>: Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening when. The most important steps you’ll be in charge of here are making scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract), and keeping your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 9: Time for demolition (2-5 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time for your contractor to pick up that sledgehammer. Be sure to protect the items that are staying with tarp or plastic, and get to work tearing out everything else. Depending on how large your apartment is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn’t take more than two to five days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (2-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our national survey, 62% of respondents named finding hidden problems in their home as a top renovation fear. Now that you’ve stripped the space down to the studs, it’ll be easy to get new plumbing or electrical where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans should be altered now, since you&#8217;re able to see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits for electrical and/or plumbing work, you&#8217;ll need inspections and a sign-off before closing the walls. While a master plumber can typically sign off on pipework for water lines in the case of a no-show by the city inspector, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project until this inspection happens. With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete, and they will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. (Note that sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times.) Check with your contractor or architect about what your project requires.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 12: Floor installation (5-12 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent having to redo the floors if you decide to reconfigure your space in the future, make sure that the flooring is consistent throughout, even if some of it will be hidden. After the floors are in, you’ll add new baseboards.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 13: Installation completion (5-20 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the kitchen, usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the bathroom, including the tub, vanity and sink, toilet, and any built-in shelving. Tiling, lighting, and hardware usually come last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the hallways and bedroom, if you are doing basic painting and touch-ups, the work will be fairly minimal compared to the kitchen and bath. If you are adding custom, built-in shelving or paneling, plan to add a few extra days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Possible delays: aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions and the arrival time of the materials.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts allow that spaces should be left in “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to hire post-construction cleaning specialists to make sure that your new floor is clean enough to eat off. For a full apartment, plan on requesting at least two cleaners to work at the same time so that it can be finished in one working day.</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline: Post-Construction Phase </strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The finish line is in sight! But don’t forget these last—but important—steps. </span></p>
<h4><strong>STEP 15: Final walk-through with the contractor (1-2 hours)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point it out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, recommends keeping notepads in each space, and not speaking to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Instead, take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on what the items are, this step could take anywhere from a day to several weeks. It depends on the items left: are you straightening a cabinet door, or waiting on installing an out-of-stock item? When it’s on the long side, though, it&#8217;s usually due to back-ordered items. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ve (hopefully)! made installments throughout the renovation. When the last item on your punch list is complete, it’s time to pay the remaining percentage to your contractor!</p>
<h3>Ready to renovate your apartment?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This timeline provides a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and a range of how long each step should take. While some factors may be outside of both your and the contractor’s control, the key is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles in advance, and allotting more time to get them done.</p>

<h3>Popular Questions Asked</h3>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487570544"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How long does it take to renovate an apartment?</strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Apartment renovation timelines are highly variable. On the short end, an apartment renovation from beginning to end could take 4 months; on the long end, it could take over a year. Obtaining permits from local municipalities, sourcing materials, and construction can add significant time to the renovation schedule. For example, some municipalities have very strict permitting processes or may require specific plans to be submitted by an architect before permits are issued. If you’re sourcing luxury materials from sources abroad, shipping and importing the products can be lengthy. Also, discovering hidden surprises during demolition (think: water damage, or wiring issues) may require a contracting team to problem-solve before proceeding with construction as planned. </p>

<p>Renovating on Long Island? From the South Shore to the North Fork, we have the numbers you’ll need to plan your renovation&#8217;s budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> breaks down the costs on four major remodeling cost categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Although “Long Island” is technically a region that is home to four New York counties, including Kings County (better known as Brooklyn!) and Queens, this cost guide focuses on the portion of the island that is colloquially known as Long Island, which is primarily Nassau and Suffolk counties. This guide does not include the Hamptons, which is a world of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own with renovation prices</a> to match.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs that include labor and materials compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf) with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+</strong> psf</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> (under 100 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$75,000+</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$15,000—$20,000</strong> (35 to 40 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel: <strong>$21,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000+</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind while it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</p>
<h3>What does a Long Island home remodel cost per square foot?</h3>
<p>Long Island’s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons means that the same regional averages apply. However, real estate prices in Long Island are lower than their neighbors on both sides, and this affects renovation costs.</p>
<p>Most full-home Sweeten renovations in villages including Great Neck, New Hyde Park, and Bellport generally start at <strong>$100</strong> psf.<span style="color: #333333;"> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a> estimates that cosmetic facelifts for dry rooms can be <strong>$30</strong>—<strong>$70</strong> psf </span><span style="color: #333333;">for his projects, while </span><span style="color: #333333;">wet rooms (rooms that are connected to a water supply, i.e., bathrooms or kitchens) typically start at <strong>$375</strong> per square feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Sweeten&#8217;s experience, bathrooms in Long Island are typically larger than 5&#8217;x8&#8242; and can measure 8&#8243;x7&#8242; or 9&#8243;x7&#8242;. High-end (full custom, luxury materials) wet room renovations can cost well over <strong>$700</strong> per square foot. This cost range includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<h5>Fewer hurdles in Long Island</h5>
<p>Since most residential renovations in Long Island are for single-family, fully detached houses, the logistics of renovation are more straightforward. Contractors won&#8217;t need to worry about where to park a car or have limits on the permitted construction hours. (Even if there are city ordinances that limit noise, those are much longer than the working hours typically permitted by an NYC co-op.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, apartment buildings, whether condo or co-op, typically require contractors to ensure cleanliness in the hallways. When workers must spend the beginning and end of the workday prepping and cleaning the halls, this can take up precious time! These factors, which don’t impact most Long Island houses, can result in more affordable prices for those renovators.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Aaron tells us that, since construction was permitted to restart after the shutdown, clients are itching to get back to their renovations. The most common renovations he’s seeing are additions, dormers, kitchens, baths, pool pavers, and decks.</span></p>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island kitchen renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can cost between <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. This typically means making use of engineered flooring, off-the-shelf cabinets, and an economical tile or butcher block for countertops. It also includes swapping out old appliances for energy-efficient models.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>’s Cost vs. Value Report shows that a mid-grade, major kitchen renovation of a 200-square-foot space will run about <strong>$69,910</strong> based on averages for the Middle Atlantic region (as opposed to <strong>$84,484</strong> for New York City). This range covers updating 30 linear feet of semi-custom wood cabinets, an island, new countertops, a double-tub stainless steel sink, energy-efficient range, vented hood, built-in microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and custom lighting. This comes to about <strong>$350</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5543#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Vita</a>, “Kitchens on Long Island typically need a full gut in order to upgrade electrical, plumbing, insulation, and correcting for settling of the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>High-end kitchen: Expect the budget to start at <strong>$75,000</strong>. The same Cost vs. Value report puts a luxury kitchen renovation around <strong>$137,700</strong> for the region. This will get you top-of-the-line custom cabinets with interior accessories, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, commercial-grade cooktop and hood, wall oven, built-in microwave, with designer faucets and a water filtration system. This budget also includes custom lighting, including under-cabinet lights, and wood flooring throughout. Broken down to price per square foot, this comes in at <strong>$689</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island bathroom renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes. Sweeten contractor Vita said, “Bathroom remodels often need the same treatment as kitchens, and require a full overhaul of plumbing, electrical supplies, insulation, exhaust ductwork as well as floor and wall straightening. Our base price for a typically-sized, 35-square-foot bathroom renovation starts at <strong>$22,158</strong>, with material and subcontractor allowances.”</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom remodel for a 35-square-foot area will cost anywhere from <strong>$21,000</strong> to <strong>$40,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report provides an average of <strong>$22,158</strong> for the Middle Atlantic region. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: Sweeten contractors report high-end renovations range starts at <strong>$40,000</strong> and goes up at luxury price points. The same report puts a high-end renovation at <strong>$69,188</strong> for the region. This is based on the expansion of a 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, within the existing home&#8217;s footprint. A high-end renovation at this price point includes radiant floors, all new ductwork, custom cabinetry, separate shower, and freestanding tub, as well as custom lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Costs for a Long Island basement renovation</h3>
<p>Based on Sweeten&#8217;s numbers, the average basement conversion in Long Island comes in at <strong>$117</strong> psf. For a budget, we&#8217;ve seen projects start at <strong>$25,000</strong> and include a bathroom, shower, and laminate flooring. On the high end, a project costing <strong>$75,000</strong> would include a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring in 20’ x 30’ space.</p>
<p>This is in line with what is reported by Sweeten contractors. For example, Sweeten contractor Vita shares that Long Island basements generally run about <strong>$35,000</strong> for a budget, <strong>$60,000</strong> for a mid-grade renovation, and more than <strong>$60,000</strong> for a high-end project.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the existing condition of the space will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper so the ceiling appears higher, and the walls could require underpinning. Sometimes electricity and plumbing need to be installed, especially if there is no existing bathroom and that’s a crucial part of your plans. Installation and waterproofing can also be a significant cost if needed.</p>
<h3>Costs for permits</h3>
<p>In Long Island, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. Towns throughout the island all levy different fees. In Suffolk County, for renovations up to <strong>$50,000</strong>, the permit fee is <strong>$250</strong>, and <strong>$500</strong> for renovations up to <strong>$100,000</strong>. For projects above <strong>$250,000</strong>, contractor Aaron estimates the cost is 15%  per <strong>$1,000</strong> for the permit. Plumbing and electrical permits both start at <strong>$50</strong>. For the full list, you can consult this fee schedule.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves,” so you can plan and get started off on the right foot.</p>

<h3>Moving mom closer to family</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to having her son, Alissa had worked in fashion and had a good eye for style, design, and finding a great value. So when it came time for her mom, Tatiana, to find, gut, and renovate an apartment, the two teamed up to take on the condo renovation in Westchester. Tatiana was both downsizing and moving from Port Washington, in Long Island, to be closer to her grandchildren. She concentrated her search in southern Westchester, about 30 minutes outside New York City. Alissa and her family live in Bedford, NY, so that location would provide easy access.</p>
<div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The mother-daughter duo prioritized location and a great building with amenities, and also looked specifically for a rundown space so that they could do a full gut condo renovation. Tatiana also wanted a condo rather than a co-op; in case she ever wanted to rent out the property in the future, she didn’t want to deal with strict building rules and sublet policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment they settled on was a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 975 square feet, located in Hartsdale, NY, in a condo complex with a pool, clubhouse, and gym. The apartment itself was outdated and the kitchen and bath were original to the building when it went up in the late &#8217;70s. Alissa <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> and the pair chose to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. Her mom closed on the unit and began the condo renovation in Westchester just a week later. Everything had to go—the floors and carpets, popcorn ceilings, walls, doors, and the entire bath and kitchen.</p>
<h3>Handling and ordering materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa and Tatiana decided that they would <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order all of the materials themselves</a>, so they could search for good values and have full control over the final look. Alissa explained, “We knew exactly the vision we wanted for the spaces. Working in fashion and living in NYC my whole life, I was able to go direct to the wholesale districts and find the best deals on items like the fixtures and other materials. This gave us leftover money to splurge on designer furniture and lighting!” The contractor took care of the demo, installation, and provided rough construction materials.</p>
<h3>Merging construction and style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My mom is very stylish and vibrant; we wanted to create a bright, airy contemporary space to match her style,&#8221; said Alissa. &#8220;We went for neutral gray tones with splashes of color.” In the living room, they chose a calming gray for the walls and floor-to-ceiling curtains, accessorizing with gold-toned finishes and brass furniture. A leather couch offers a grounding contrast to the animal print rug—both on-trend and grandchild-friendly. Dark gray wood flooring and Jonathan Adler lighting are seen throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a more affordable solution, the contractor covered the popcorn ceiling with a one-quarter-inch layer of sheetrock rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoothing out the texture</a>, which would have been time-consuming and costly.</p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h3>Kid-friendly materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tatiana wanted her apartment to be “dressed” in a way that resembled her personal style: classic with a flair. In the kitchen, this meant going with a clean, bright white. Shaker cabinet fronts with nickel hardware were selected for their simplicity and mixed with open shelving as well as glass fronts. Stainless steel appliances complete the look. White and gray porcelain tile on the floor mimicked the look of marble without the price tag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining area, the mother-daughter duo was thrilled to find leather chairs in a bold cobalt blue at a Lillian August SONO outlet in Connecticut. Durable and wipeable, they are perfect for visiting grandchildren and sit around a dining table under a silver drum pendant light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They painted Tatiana’s bedroom in warm ivory tones, with blush pink velvet curtains and a comfortable armchair. The colors are calming, and the high-gloss sheen they chose for the paint “gives the walls a very lush feel and works really well with all the velvet,” said Alissa.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34252 mb-0 size-chrono" title="open-glass-panel-door-in-foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif" alt="open glass panel door in the foyer opening to a white room after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The serene bathroom is in a similar color palette to the kitchen. The marble tile floors and walls complement a white vanity that has plenty of drawer space. Alissa and Tatiana accessorized the space with woven covered baskets for storage and to add a bit of warmth. They also reglazed the original bathtub and added a glass shower divider to remove the need for a shower curtain.</p>
<h3>Alissa&#8217;s renovation tip: Measure your appliances—and then measure again!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alissa shared with us a hiccup in the process: “Funny story—this was such an amateur move! Before the renovation started, we were online looking at kitchen appliances, got overly excited, and bought a refrigerator without taking the measurements first. My mom picked out the BIGGEST double refrigerator, thinking it would fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the appliances were delivered, the refrigerator did not fit through the front door! It was so annoying—the store had to take it back, and then we had to take very careful measurements and select another style to satisfy the space. After that incident, we measured and re-measured before making a purchase!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite that obstacle, the Sweeten contractor met the deadlines and even delivered the apartment a few days early. Since the project&#8217;s completion, Tatiana reports that “the new space is amazing, and I never want to leave!”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovating can be a big undertaking, and if your project involves an entire home, flooring installation is an important piece of the puzzle that unites the space. But when there are so many flooring options and costs, how do you pick one?</span> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lays out the different options for flooring installation, plus factors that determine how much a flooring remodel will cost. <span>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s examine the variables that go into <span style="font-weight: 400;">remodeling floors</span> one by one.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much will my reflooring project cost? </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s3">If the floors do not need to be replaced, a simple refinishing job can run you an average of <b>$5 per square foot or less</b>. In the higher range, a project with a mid-grade finish can cost <b>$10 per square foot)</b> to sand and refinish which also includes other factors such as removal and relocation of furniture, clean-up, and protection.</span><span class="s4"><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s3">If you’re looking to install all new flooring, you’re looking at about <b>$15 to $20 per square foot</b>, for a full project using a mid-grade hardwood.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s3">If you don’t need a new subfloor, the costs will be lower.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s3">For luxury or other expensive materials, you’re looking at <b>$20,000 to $25,000</b> for the full project.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These prices represent all-in budgets (including both materials and labor).</span></p>
<h3><strong>What does a flooring contractor do?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flooring contractors are specialists who handle all aspects of floor refinishing and replacement. A flooring contractor should be able to help with material selection, design, removal of old floors, and installation. Some flooring contractors handle all types of floors, including vinyl and linoleum. Others may specialize in higher-end hardwood floors or custom tilework.</span></p>
<h3>Flooring labor &amp; installation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your contractor will consider many variables to gauge the scope and complexity of your project and provide a total cost. As with all things renovation-related, the more complex the project, the higher the costs will run.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most contractors will assess labor costs for a flooring project on an hourly basis or on a per-day basis. You may see wide variation in hourly rates; particularly low hourly rates </span><b>(under $50 an hour).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But beware: a low rate may signal that a contractor is not insured.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might see a quote that sets an </span><b>hourly rate of $100-$200</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for each worker. Discuss rates with your contractor so that you can get a feel for what they think is needed and why. Some contractors may prefer to charge based on square footage.</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells, “We typically charge about $4 per square foot for installing vinyl tile, for example, but if it’s very thick we may charge closer to $6-8 per square foot. The thicker the vinyl, the closer it becomes to a normal tile. This is because the thicker tile (whether vinyl or regular) requires it to be ‘back buttered,’ which is applying glue on the back of the tile, as well as on the floor.” More work equals a higher cost. </span> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The requirements of individual buildings can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs that meet higher insurance requirements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refinishing floors requires fewer license and certification steps than installing floors. Many general contractors can refinish floors; those who install new floors have to go through more rigorous licensing and certification hoops.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48126" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GRAPH-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1100" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GRAPH-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GRAPH-1-273x300.jpg 273w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GRAPH-1-600x660.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Options for flooring: Materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Are you starting from scratch, or rehabbing existing floors?</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Many homes have original <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-wood-floors/"><span class="s5">hardwoods that are worth reviving</span></a>, but floors can reach a limit in their capacity for refinishing. If your floors have already been refinished numerous times, you might not have enough surface depth to sand down. Your GC can examine your floors and determine their thickness. </span><span class="s6"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you decide your existing floors still have life in them, consider a more eco-friendly stain or finish. These new products help minimize fumes and are more environmentally friendly. You may need to work with your contractor to ensure that you can successfully bond newer products to older floors for an even finish. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">If you are working with engineered wood flooring, make sure to consult the manufacturer on whether sanding/refinishing is recommended.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Other materials, such as laminate, resilient (vinyl or linoleum), cannot be refinished if damaged. Chipped tile can be replaced, but only if you can find a match!<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><b>How much do you want to spend on flooring materials?</b></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Wood/engineered wood flooring &amp; costs</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are endless options for <a href="https://blog.sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/"><span class="s8">flooring materials</span></a>, starting at <b>$1 per square foot</b> for laminate options, <b>under $3 per square foot</b> for engineered wood options, and under <b>$6 per square foot</b> for solid wood options. You can achieve the look of wood with laminate which can be installed in high traffic areas or where <a href="https://blog.sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/"><span class="s8">daily spills or dents</span></a> might occur. </span></p>
<h4><b>Cost to install engineered wood</b></h4>
<p><span class="s4">Engineered wood, a wood veneer backed by a composite like plywood giving it stability, can perform well in environments subject to moisture like bathrooms or basements.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="s4">Solid wood expands and contracts and is best in living spaces like bedrooms and living rooms. National retailers offer color and texture choices at starting price points. Reclaimed or bespoke hardwoods at boutique outlets start at <b>$12 per square foot</b>.</span></p>
<h4><b>Cost to install b</b><span class="s1">amboo flooring</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it&#8217;s actually a grass, bamboo is a great alternative to wood. It looks natural and warm, endures light to medium wear, and is easy underfoot. Most bamboo flooring is made of a bamboo veneer attached to a backing, like plywood or MDF. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, be mindful of quality. Bamboo gets treated with many chemicals to turn it into a material suitable for flooring, so</span><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/what-is-off-gassing"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">off-gassing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be a factor. Also, as a relative newcomer to flooring, it has many manufacturing sources, and quality control is not yet highly regulated. Investigate thoroughly, as with any product you bring into your home. According to Sweeten contractor Thomas, bamboo typically runs from $8 to $15 per square foot. </span></p>
<h4><b>Cost to install l</b><span class="s1">aminate flooring </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like laminate countertops, laminate flooring is composed of dense fiberboard topped with a photographic image of real wood (or other material). It is then topped with a clear protective layer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laminate flooring resists light scratching and fading from sunlight. Many manufacturers have incorporated a sound-muffling material underneath, like cork, to prevent that recognizable hollow sound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no glue or nails, these floating boards connect by an interlocking tongue and groove design. The boards don’t need to be joined to a subfloor and can be installed over an uneven surface as long as it’s sealed and remains dry. The cost to install laminate flooring typically runs from $1 to $5 per square foot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Laminate wears well, but like wood, it won’t withstand prolonged exposure to water; plus, it’s slippery when wet. Also, it&#8217;s not possible to refinish linoleum! If there’s damage, you’ll have to replace the entire board so order extra to have an exact match if needed.

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Resilient non-wood flooring options &amp; costs</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Mostly vinyl falls into this category, but there’s also linoleum. As the term “resilient” indicates, this flooring is easy on humans when little ones fall or adults who stand for long periods. It also handles a lot of wear or sunlight and resists stains from food and drink spills as well as crayons and magic markers. </span><span class="s9">Pricing for resilient (vinyl &amp; linoleum) can vary widely, and runs from <strong>$3</strong> to <strong>$25</strong> per square foot. </span></p>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s2"><strong>Vinyl plank flooring</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Recent advances in manufacturing have improved the performance of vinyl plank flooring. You can now find vinyl that infuses the surface with cultured diamond particles for increased protection against dents, scratches, scuffs, and stains. Better HD printing allows it to look like wood or tile but on close inspection, you’ll know it’s vinyl. Its faux effects, however, can be part of its fashion-forward appeal. Vinyl remains probably your thriftiest choice, depending on the pattern. </span></p>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s2"><strong>Linoleum flooring</strong></span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Linoleum is a popular flooring option, due to its range of saturated colors or marbled effects, resiliency, slip resistance, and everyday wear. It comes in sheets, for an almost seamless appearance, as well as tiles if you want a classic checkerboard or just like that look. Because linoleum is made of linseed oil and other naturally-sourced materials, it is marketed as a “green” flooring choice. However, it requires chemicals to arrive at the finished, manufactured product; so understand its off-gassing and VOC ratings.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Note: They both wear well but can’t be refinished. Buy extra in case of repairs so you can match the area you need to patch.</span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Tile flooring options &amp; costs </span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s10">Between</span><span class="s1"> ceramic and porcelain, the latter is the harder of the two and is better at handling a lot of foot traffic. Completely resistant to fading, scratches, and moisture, tile is good for a busy household. Until children are old enough where toddling and falling is not an issue, use a rug in areas where little ones congregate. Many tiles are also slip-resistant. Tile ranges from <strong>$3</strong> to <strong>$25</strong> per square foot, depending on the material and its construction.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s10">Note</span><span class="s1">: Dishware will break on this super-hard surface, and tile can crack if not installed by a pro on a perfectly smooth surface. </span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s2">How much flooring should you order?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you finalize your order, talk to your contractor or supplier about quantity. You will probably need to order 10 percent extra to make sure that you have enough materials to cover the full square footage of your space as pieces are cut down and customized. Prepare to add approximately <b>$2 per square foot</b> in freight costs to your budget, regardless of whether you go for bargain floors or luxe floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Will you encounter any lead paint? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The minute lead paint comes into the picture, the requirements and costs change. If you are tearing up old floors that were built before lead paint restrictions started, discuss the options with your contractor. Can you safely remove and discard the debris? Or will you float your new floors on top of the old floors to avoid circulating lead paint dust during the project?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the various types of flooring materials. Some basic renovation costs vary based on the level of skilled labor required and the location of the project, no matter what you spend on materials. Having a good handle on the real costs involved will allow you to better align your budget, avoid surprises, and get you that much closer to your dream floor.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What does a flooring contractor do?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Flooring contractors are specialists who handle all aspects of floor refinishing and replacement. A flooring contractor should be able to help with material selection, design, removal of old floors, and installation. Some flooring contractors handle all types of floors, including vinyl and linoleum. Others may specialize in higher-end hardwood floors or custom tile work.</p>

			<h2>Wondering how to finance your home renovation? There are options for every home and every economic cycle.</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57494 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Janes-Bedroom-A-02-scaled.webp" alt="room mid-remodel" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Janes-Bedroom-A-02-scaled.webp 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Janes-Bedroom-A-02-scaled-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Janes-Bedroom-A-02-scaled-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><br /><b style="line-height: 1.5;"></b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>How can I finance my <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">home renovation</a>?</em> This is a popular question for us at Sweeten! We&#8217;ve been gathering insights from homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">contractors</a>, and financing experts over many years, and have distilled them into the following guidelines. We hope they&#8217;ll simplify your planning, and maybe even open up new possibilities for your renovation.</span></p>
<h3>Five financing options</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Pay in cash</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if interest rates are low, paying in cash is the most straightforward option. Just as with other payment methods, you&#8217;ll want to agree on a clear payment plan with your contractor to avoid surprises. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most projects require a deposit upfront with installments made at specific points. On a smaller project, terms might be for two payments, with 50% due upfront and 50% due at completion. For a mid-sized project like a kitchen renovation, you might agree to pay 15% to 30% upfront, 40% to 50% at the midway point, and the final 15% to 30% upon completion. </span></p>
<h5>Payment plans for large projects</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larger projects</a> tend to require a smaller deposit upfront but more payments along the way. You can expect payments attached to milestones like demolition, midpoint, and punch-list completion. Negotiate with your general contractor to establish these terms and get them all in writing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you renovate with Sweeten, you&#8217;ll be able to pay electronically through <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/payments/">Sweeten Payments</a>—a simple way to automate the payment process without the hassle paper checks. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Take out a personal or unsecured loan</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your renovation will cost under $50,000, you might consider a personal (or “unsecured”) loan from a credit union, bank, or another lender. These loans don&#8217;t require collateral; meaning, the loan isn’t tied to your home and won’t jeopardize it if you default. They&#8217;re also usually fairly easy to acquire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;ll get a higher funding limit than you would from most credit cards, but not high as you can get from a secured loan. These loans tend to be offered for a fixed term at a fixed interest rate and are repaid in monthly installments. The downside is that the interest rates on personal loans tend to be much higher than on loans associated with your home (like mortgages with built-in renovation financing, home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expect to pay interest in the range of 5-6% on a $50,000 loan over 24 months for personal unsecured loans<span class="s1">.</span> Rates tend to vary quite a bit for personal loans, so do your research to see what makes the most sense for your renovation.</p>
<h4><b>3. Build financing into your mortgage </b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are currently in the process of purchasing a home, this may be the best option. Alternately, if you already own but are considering refinancing, this option can help you adjust your mortgage rate while rolling new financing into it. (This process is known as “cash-out refinancing”). Either way, you go through both the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage and renovation financing application</a> process just once and you’ll end up with one monthly payment for both.</span></p>
<h5>Home&#8217;s future value</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your lender will likely calculate the amount of the loan based on the future value of the renovated property. This lets you borrow more, because you may qualify for a larger loan than you would if the calculation were based on the home&#8217;s pre-renovation value. This also tends to mean that you don&#8217;t have to worry as much about the current condition of the home; with some other types of financing, the lender may balk if the property is in bad shape.</span></p>
<h5>Types of mortgages</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with regular mortgages, you can choose between a conventional loan and one backed by the </span><strong><a href="https://www.fha.com/fha_loan_requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Housing Administration (FHA)</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, known as an FHA 203(k) loan. 203(k) loans have more lenient guidelines and allow the homeowner to borrow a higher percentage of the home’s current value. With either a conventional or FHA mortgage, your monthly payments may be lower than they would be with a home equity loan or line of credit (both detailed below), but</span><span class="s1"> slightly higher than with a regular mortgage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans are also attractive because they lock in your interest rate.   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgages with built-in renovation loans may have requirements regarding the timing of your renovation. You may have to begin and complete your renovation within a set window after closing. The rules may also stipulate that renovation work cannot stop for more than a set time. These loans may not work if you need an open timeline or if you want to carry out your renovation in stages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, note that these loans can take 60-90 days from application to completion—because your construction plans need to be in place, and the appraiser needs to review them to assess the post-renovation value of your home.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">4. Take out a home equity loan (HEL)</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A home equity loan, often referred to as a “second mortgage,” is an option if your home is worth more than what you now owe on your mortgage. This type of loan is similar to a conventional mortgage in two ways. It offers tax deductions on interest payments. And you make payments over a similarly long timeframe. Take note: there may be closing costs. And some lenders charge a penalty for paying off the loan early.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates are usually fixed on home equity loans, but the rate is somewhat higher than with conventional mortgages. </span><span class="s1">Still, thanks to the current low prime rate, you’ll get a better rate than you would have in years past. </span></p>
<h4><b style="line-height: 1.5;">5. Establish a home equity line of credit (HELOC)</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>home equity line of credit</strong> is similar to a credit card. The lender gives you a credit limit and charges you interest on the amount you use. Instead of receiving a lump sum upfront, you borrow what you want, when you want. This makes it a good option for a series of projects, or if you anticipate having a long renovation. You can obtain these types of loans from all the usual sources—banks, finance companies, brokerages, and credit unions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interest rates are adjustable, so beware of loans with low initial rates. Some may also have a minimum withdraw, and many offer 5-10 year limits on access to the credit line. While the credit line is open, you pay interest on what you owe, and then you typically have 10-15 years after it closes to pay it back in full. Compared with home equity loans, a home equity line of credit offers more flexibility. However, since the rate fluctuates, it is also riskier. Terms and conditions vary widely on credit lines, interest rates, and fees, so it’s important to read the fine print.</p>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>

<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>. According to Remodeling’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</span></a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223</strong> in New York. This is based on expanding an existing 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, relocating all fixtures, and installing a new shower with a frameless glass enclosure, freestanding soaker tub with high-end faucets, stone counters with dual sinks, one-piece toilet, and a humidistat-controlled exhaust fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

<li>This <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/600/Electrical-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Permit Fee Schedule</a> indicates that electrical permits range from a minimum of <strong>$50</strong> for a re-inspection to <strong>$1,000</strong> for additions, renovations, basement wiring, and garages with more than 7 devices over 15,000 square feet.</li>
<li>Fees for plumbing fixtures are <strong>$5</strong> per fixture with a <strong>$50</strong> minimum.</li>

<h3>Finding their circa 1900 Brooklyn brownstone home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a grueling year-long search, countless open houses, and one house lost in a bidding war, we found our home. Remarkably, it had everything we wanted: it was a two-family home in the heart of “brownstone” Brooklyn, with original hardwood floors. Most of the houses in the neighborhood were built circa 1900. Many we viewed did not stand the test of time, but this home had been in the same family for years and did not show the usual wear-and-tear of a 100-year-old home. We were lucky, but we did need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embark on an old home renovation</a>.</p>

<p>I was thankful to stumble upon <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> early in my search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Bed-Stuy</a>. While I had owned a home before, this was our first time doing a large-scale Brooklyn <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone renovation</a> that would require more than our DIY skills could handle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout of the house and our budget did not afford us a ton of options, so the renovation was straightforward. We focused on structural changes to change the flow and use of the house. Thankfully, when we moved in, we were able to live in the garden floor apartment while we renovated the upper two floors where we would eventually live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08.jpg" alt="brownstone living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45702" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45700" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Salvaging and repurposing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We removed the original entry doors as you come into the entry foyer, but left the structural wall intact. This allowed the area to feel more open as you continue into the living area; it also gave back more livable space to work with. However, I loved the original details of the doors. Luckily, they just fit the ceiling clearance on the second floor and they found new life as the guest room headboard.</p>
<p>In the living room and through to the kitchen, we tore down two walls and exposed a long expanse of brick wall. The former owner had repointed the brick in the front room with black mortar, which was a real eyesore. When we exposed the whole length of the house, we were left with two walls that didn’t match. Limited by our budget, we repointed the half that was previously covered and experimented with painting techniques to blend the two together.</p>

<h3>An overhaul for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">I wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the updated kitchen</a> to be the focus of the home. There were three main obstacles: adding a door for backyard access, the ceiling height, and a must-have double oven. I initially wanted to enlarge the back window above the sink to make it a focal point and let in more natural light. Not far along into <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the kitchen process</a>, I had to abandon that idea since we were concerned with what the enlarged opening would do to the structural integrity of the home, given its age. It was also a huge expense so we chose to use those dollars elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In the end, we actually made the window above the sink slightly smaller to allow for a proper backsplash. We replaced the second window with a door and added a small landing and stairs for easy backyard access.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right appliances</h3>
<p>The next question was how to vent the hood with 11-foot-high ceilings and open shelving left nowhere to hide. Ultimately, the ducting was kept exposed and vented directly through the wall outside. I love the industrial element it adds to the newly renovated space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, where to fit the double oven? At first, I was concerned I would be giving up valuable pantry space, but the layout worked out perfectly and there was room for everything we wanted, even the custom built-in beverage taps. We are home-brewing enthusiasts and wanted a unique feature in our kitchen to showcase that.</p>

<h3>Splurging and saving</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the first-floor bath</a> which was an easy update. The layout was already functional, so we kept it as-is with a direct replacement—aka rip-and-replace—of all the fixtures. We were able to salvage the original door and reuse the existing tub. We later put our DIY skills to the test and added fun wallpaper and wainscoting.</p>

<p>&#8220;He worked with us to determine where we could splurge and save.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The top floor previously served as a separate apartment complete with its own kitchen. We wanted to have a master bedroom, master closet, master bathroom, guest bedroom, and laundry room. The tricky part was figuring out where to put everything. The pre-existing kitchen allowed us to easily add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a> without a huge expense. Once that was decided, everything else fell into place.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45703" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet is a dream spot that had been a small room that our contractor converted. My favorite splurge on the top floor was adding a heated bathroom floor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bathroom process</a>—worth every penny in the winter.</p>
<p>Throughout the house, we did some major upgrades that elevate the whole space: we put up fresh drywall throughout the second floor, refinished the original floors in a dark walnut color, and replaced all the windows in the house.</p>

<h3>Brooklyn brownstone renovation: budget and process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While I would not necessarily recommend living in a renovation (so much dust), it did allow us to check on the progress and be more involved in day-to-day decisions such as outlet locations and doorknob height. We optimistically thought the renovation would take three months, but we did add on some significant projects that stretched the timeline. Overall, once we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose our contractors</a>, the project took about five months to complete the top two floors with some minor updates in the garden apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Start your renovation with Sweeten</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aligning our budget</a> was our major obstacle, but <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consulting with our contractor</a> was great. He worked with us to determine where we could <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">splurge and save in each room</a>. Once our Sweeten contractor realized we were quite handy, we were able to figure out what we could do ourselves versus what we should leave to the professionals. For example, we chose to take on all the painting, which was a huge undertaking. I’m talking all ceilings, all walls, all trim, and multiple coats! I don’t think we understood what a huge task it was—and that in certain spaces, the contractor was unable to move forward until we completed painting. I’m glad we did it, but it was a grueling several months and I’m pretty sure I gave myself carpal tunnel.</p>

<h3>Switching the brownstone layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in terms of the function of the home was separating the garden floor apartment from the upper two floors. In dividing the two, we were able to gain a coat closet in the apartment and additional storage space for us before the basement level. The ground floor is now available as its own standalone rental unit, while we live on the two floors above. Now that the house is done, I am so thankful we splurged on what we wanted—replacing the windows, skim-coating, and repointing the brick; those are some of my favorite things in the house.</p>

<h3>Popular questions asked</h3>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937202274"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a brownstone?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Brownstone is a historically popular building material. Short for brown sandstone, brownstone is characterized by its dark appearance due to the ample amount of iron in the stone. Typically, a true brownstone house will be made of brick, with only the exterior being sandstone. Sandstone—also called freestone—is soft, which makes it easy to cut in any direction. This allows for a multitude of styles and variety in design.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937223936"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What does a brownstone house look like?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Brownstone houses have the basement above ground, with a stoop staircase extending up the main floor. Brownstones were originally designed so that the basement would not be able to flood, and any water that got into the basement would be minimal. Normally these townhomes are between 3 and 4 floors, which provides ample living space.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635937245671"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Why are brownstones so expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Even though brownstone is great for sculpting and pattern making, it is a fragile material. Many brownstones were built in the 19th century, so the restoration process for 21st-century homeowners can be lengthy and intricate. The fragility of the stone makes it very hard to replicate what used to exist and then to match it to the surrounding brownstone townhomes. The intricate designs allow for a beautiful finish, but it comes at a price.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45354 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg" alt="A brand new condo remodeling Miami" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City of Miami building permits </span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Are you considering condo remodeling in Miami? While renovating a condo is usually a more limited proposition than renovating a house, Sweeten offers guidelines on a few special considerations you’ll need to take into account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First,</span><span class="s1"> you will need to obtain the proper city and building approvals before beginning your project. Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6622#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Sandra</a>, who is based in Miami, tells us, “The typical process takes about 4-8 weeks for a mid-sized project. [Usually,] the office management has pretty much the same requirements as the city.” You must apply first to the city, and once the city approves the permit, the information is submitted to the management office for the condo. The most common permits required in a condo remodeling Miami project are </span><span class="s1">floor soundproofing, plumbing, electrical, and framing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements </span></h3>
<p>In addition to obtaining city permits, many new building projects must also meet new building requirements. You must usually meet and comply with regulations around work hours, rubbish removal, gas installation, and more. Licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/miami-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Miami</a> with experience would be able to navigate any building paperwork and restrictions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything you should be mindful of during your project:</p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">1) Working hours</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">These are more limited than in a free-standing house. Typically, buildings will permit workers access between the hours of 9AM &#8211; 4PM (occasionally, until 5pm) on weekdays. This translates into shorter working hours. As a result, a condo renovation may take longer than that same project in a house.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">2) Prepping common areas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Buildings will require workers to protect the common lobby, hallways, and elevators. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Just note, this can keep the GC from working on the actual project on any given day. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">3) Rubbish removal</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">As in all large buildings, trash removal presents a bigger obstacle than in a free-standing house. As Miami-based Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Adrian</a> explains, due to the more protracted process, “the cost of removing the trash is much higher in a condo than in a single-family home.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">The cost for a trash removal service is based on the number of “pulls” it takes to remove debris. According to Adrian’s experience, to remove and replace floor tile in a 1,000-square-foot condo, he estimates it would require four pulls (2-3 for old tile, and one pull for new tile waste). The cost would be around $3,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Sandra concurs: “We spend a lot of time doing this and do it on a daily basis. That means we need to reserve the elevator every time we have to bring it down. We cannot use the building dumpster, so we need to put it in our truck and haul it away.” </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">4) Altering the slab</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Since even the oldest Miami condos date only back to the ‘50s and ‘60s, they are largely concrete structures. Sweeten contractor Sandra explains, “It is possible but very complex. We would need a structural engineer affidavit and structural plans.” Management will likely be strict about this aspect of the renovation. After all, altering the slab can affect the building&#8217;s other units. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Technically, it is possible to trench or drill to lay plumbing or electrical. However, you would need to prove that you will not compromise the integrity of the slab. Oftentimes, buildings will require “scanning” (via a professional vendor) of the area where the proposed alteration will occur. Sweeten contractor Adrian estimates that it usually costs approximately $600 to scan 100-200 square feet. </span>“If you are going to core drill, the building may not require an engineer to sign off on the alteration,” said Adrian. “But if you are going to trench along the slab then they most certainly will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">5) Gas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Most Miami condos feature electric stoves and dryers. That said, gas stoves are becoming slightly more common in new luxury buildings. Our Sweeten contractors do not know of buildings that permit gas dryers. If your condo unit does not currently have a washer/dryer in-unit, there’s a 50/50 chance that it’ll be permitted. Again, this is up to your management company’s rules. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">6) Windows</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"> Due to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the seasonal hurricanes</a>, building codes require impact windows. Luckily, this isn’t the responsibility of the individual renovator because windows are typically a building-wide project. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">7) Fees</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Lastly, expect the management company to charge you a fee for renovating your condo. Just note, these fees are paid in addition to any permit and approval charges. These fees aren&#8217;t unique to Miami, this is standard in condos across the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, you should have a sense of what to look out for in your Miami condo renovation. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best general contractors in Miami</a></span>.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As you prepare for a major renovation, you will be focused on finding a great general contractor. Other items on the list include selecting materials and figuring out costs. With this long to-do list, it’s easy to overlook plans for site prep and protection. Sweeten breaks down how it can have a big effect on your home during and after the renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten</span></a><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Discuss site prep and protection with your contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors generally work with you on protecting the existing space. However, it&#8217;s mainly to prevent damage rather than block dirt and grime. That is to say, your floors shouldn’t be scratched or dented, but they may be dusty, streaky, or even sticky. They will need to be cleaned up after the fact. You&#8217;ll want to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss with your contractor</a> your expectations for cleanliness over the duration of the renovation. What services are included and their costs vary depending on the project and the contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Decide whether to stay or go during renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Site prep is an important undertaking, especially for homeowners who are renovating just one part of their residence. It becomes even more important if you plan to continue living at home through the renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Staying put may cost more</a> than clearing out completely. Extra time and effort go into set-up and tear-down each day. Crews must first lay paper, hang tarp, and add any other protective barriers. These all have to be taken down at the end of the work day in order for the owners to use their home at night.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, if you are renovating the kitchen and your only bathroom, your contractor will need to make sure you can maintain access to the facilities. You&#8217;ll also need a pathway to walk through to the rest of the apartment. On the other hand, a renovation in an unoccupied home allows the crew to leave the space in relative disarray at the end of the day. The next morning, they can pick up right where they left off. For this reason, whether or not you leave during the renovation is usually part of the initial conversation with your contractor to determine a project estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Prep and protect your home, and seal the construction site</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are undertaking anything other than a complete gut renovation, you can do the following to limit the disruption and minimize the mess:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cordon off the renovation zone</b> by hanging heavy-duty tarp (at least .8 millimeters thick) from the ceiling down to the floor to create a seal. Apply masking tape across all sides of the tarp where it meets the ceiling, walls, and floor. Tension rods can also help hold up heavy tarps. Particles will fly through any and all gaps you leave, no matter how small. If you need a flap for entry and exit, consider applying an <span class="s4">adhesive zipper</span> to your tarp. Add a double layer if there will be a lot of sanding or if you know that dangerous particles will be released into the air.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Within the reno zone, <b>protect anything that you’re keeping.</b> Floors should be covered with construction paper (maybe even a double layer, as insurance against tearing). Cover window treatments or appliances with tarp (again, leaving no gaps).</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">If the reno zone is in the center of your home, <b>consider laying continuous paper or tarp through all the high traffic areas.</b> This will prevent dirt from tracking into the rest of the space.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cover all furniture</b> throughout the home (especially textile surfaces such as couches and beds) with a drop cloth or tarp.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Seal up closet doors</b> by applying masking tape to the gaps between the doors and the floor. Nothing more annoying than having to wash <i>all </i>your dusty clothes because you forgot to do this. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Clear the air</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Vacuum, preferably with a <b>HEPA (“high efficiency particulate air”) vacuum at the end of each work day</b>—you can rent one or discuss getting one with your contractor. HEPA vacuums are able to trap much smaller particles than normal vacuums.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have one, <b>run a HEPA air purifier</b> on high 24/7, and change or wash the filters frequently since they will be working a lot harder than usual. If you don’t have one, consider renting a commercial-grade air scrubber for the duration of the renovation.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Open the windows</b>! The more air circulates, the better. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The costs of prevention are fairly minimal (with the exception of an air scrubber rental, which can run you several hundred dollars depending on how long you need it) but important to identify and account for upfront so that you and your team are on the same page about expectations. And even with excellent containment, you’ll most likely need a dedicated cleaning after the project is done. Read on for how to approach a deep post-construction clean. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46403 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Post A Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How to approach your post-reno deep clean</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Unless you explicitly build it into your contract, extensive cleaning is typically not part of your contractor’s job. The industry standard is “broom-swept,” which usually involves vacuuming up larger bits of debris and then running a broom across the floor. Anything beyond this (including cleaning up common spaces such as hallways and elevators) will need to be specifically arranged, and will most likely incur additional costs that you’ll bear as the homeowner.</span></p>
<h4 class="p4"><span class="s1">Renovation clean-up services</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s5">Whether you moved out or stayed put in your home during the renovation process, you’ll need to arrange for a deep post-construction clean up once that last drawer pull is attached and the final coat of paint applied. Homeowners can undertake the deep clean themselves or outsource it to one of the many companies that focus on this service. <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/p/house-cleaning-prices"><span class="s6">Thumbtack</span></a></span><span class="s1"> shared that the cost of a deep clean isn&#8217;t necessarily determined by the size of a space but by the level of effort. A 3-bed, 2,000-square-foot home costs $250 to clean on average, while a 1-bed apartment starts at $110. Post-construction cleans will cost more so you can expect to at least double these numbers for a deep, post-construction clean. </span></p>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s1">Clean-up steps after renovating:</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Usually, a post-construction clean up will include the following:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Sweep and vacuum all surfaces, including ceilings and walls<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Sweep, mop, and disinfect floors<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Vacuum all upholstery<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Wipe down doors, knobs, baseboards, moldings, and hardware<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Thorough wipe-down and sanitization of bathrooms and kitchens (including appliances, cabinets, and counters)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Dust, vacuum, and wipe-down of all window interiors including sills and frames<br /></span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Dust all ducts, grates, vents, blinds, ceiling fans, and lighting fixtures</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Clean all hardware hinges and handles,</span><span class="s1"> shelves, and cabinets</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Clean inside all closets</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Removal of all remaining trash and debris (although your contractor should have removed most of this as part of the contract)<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’re deciding whether to clean up after a renovation yourself or to outsource it, ask yourself these questions:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s1">Do you have the energy and time?<br /></span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s1">How long will it take you?<br /></span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s1">Do you have any money left in the renovation budget you could put toward the clean? (Or better yet, build it in now if you haven’t started).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Different circumstances will determine who does the job, but a thorough clean is crucial. All kinds of particles are released into the air during renovations, including various toxins, mold spores, silicates, and ultrafine dust that can damage your lungs. Freshly applied paints, lacquers, and primers also give off fumes. The hefty price tag for a proper clean may well be worth it.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638354224152"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is post-construction cleaning?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Renovation is messy, even when contractors take all reasonable anti-dust precautions and clean up every day. Most renovation contracts stipulate that the space will be delivered to you “broom-swept.” This is not a condition that you’ll want to live in. To really get your home clean and free of dust—in the renovated rooms and beyond—you’ll need a deep clean. You can undertake this yourself, or hire a service.</p>

</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

<h3>Time for a change</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In 2001, Laura and Tim bought and moved into their first home—a 1929 brick townhouse in Queens. The single-family home measures 1,360 square feet on two floors, plus a finished basement. Having raised their family there, the pair were finally ready to tackle some of the issues that had plagued their charming, but problematic, house. </span></p>

<p>The galley-style kitchen was falling apart and had also suffered water damage from a leaking shower upstairs. A kitchen remodel with new cabinets, flooring, and wall treatments had been the initial plan. They had recently purchased new appliances but the rest of the space had gotten “old and grungy,” according to Laura.</p>

<h3>A full-extension project</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They wanted to create a “comfy, modern kitchen that still matched the period feel in the rest of the house while providing more storage and better flow.” The kitchen also had a drafty door to the patio, which they never used because of its impractical location. An interior designer friend, Suzy Leon of Suzy Leon Design, Ltd., made suggestions, and one thing led to another—taking the homeowners from a kitchen remodel to a full-blown townhouse extension project. Laura and Tim <span class="s3">posted their project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected with vetted remodeling firms</a> who worked in her Queens neighborhood. They then </span>chose their Sweeten contractor to perform the townhouse kitchen extension project.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As a result of the townhouse extension, the old patio became part of the kitchen and dining space, and skylights were added to the new ceiling to bring in more light. The kitchen is now a beautifully organized and cheerful space for the family. Since it remained a galley layout, the homeowners chose simple textures and light colors to contrast a wide-plank dark wood floor with some grain and character. </span></p>
<h3>A bright and modern feel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The cabinets have <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/what-are-shaker-style-cabinets-and-how-to-style-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shaker-style fronts</a> in a minty green, which “matches the feel of the old house but is also clean and modern at the same time.” A tall pantry cabinet opens to reveal a column of drawers for optimal food storage. The white quartz countertop lightens up the space, and an enormous sink means there’ll be enough room for even the largest pots. The oversized undercounter sink has an instant hot faucet, disposal, and stainless steel finish to match the appliances. At one end, a wine fridge provides extra space for beverages next to the refrigerator. </span></p>

<p><span class="s2">“The kitchen extension came out beautifully! We love the new flow, the light, and the extra space.” Laura reports that the extension is a lovely addition to the house where guests naturally gravitate, and the skylights add light and fresh air. Moving the doorway between the dining room and kitchen improved the flow to the basement.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Due to the domino effect often seen in renovations, the basement also had to be brought up to code—with updates to the bathroom and boiler. They also took the renovation as an opportunity to install mini-split systems in the whole house so that they would no longer have to deal with inefficient window units. The homeowners love their new space, and are satisfied with having addressed their long list of broken or less-than-perfect things in the house. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A step-by-step guide and timeline for a kitchen renovation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47677" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg" alt="how long does a kitchen remodel take" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting your renovation on the calendar</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common questions that we at Sweeten hear from homeowners is “How long does a kitchen renovation take?” This usually comes right after “How much does a <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation cost</a>?” Our handy <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovation Checklist</a> tells you what you need to do—but how long does it take to do it all?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Typically, we suggest that after closing on your apartment, you allow three weeks to four months for the completion of your kitchen renovation. The timeframe depends on complexity, the size of your space, and scope.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if you are 1) not altering the footprint, 2) not changing or adding electrical or plumbing, and 3) using stock cabinetry and appliances, it’s reasonable to expect that your renovation will be done in a few weeks. If, however, you are moving your kitchen from one part of your home to another, requiring both city permits as well as board approvals, and using imported custom cabinets—you should give it several months. The wide range is due to the fact that there can be many moving parts and multiple parties involved. Certain aspects may be beyond your control. Sweeten breaks down a kitchen renovation step-by-step.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, a lot needs to happen before picking up that sledgehammer. Here, the details on each box that needs to be ticked before you break ground on the project.</p>
<h3>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a significant number of homeowners who are in contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. The best advice is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wait until you have closed on the property</a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry—at least wait until you’ve signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Post your project (1-3 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First things first: Post your project to Sweeten and begin soliciting bids. On the Sweeten site, add some details about the space you want to renovate. Inspiration photos are optional but useful for us to find you contractors who have done similar styles. Include any other information that would help Sweeten match you with the right contractors. You&#8217;ll receive 3-5 matches with links to check out contractors&#8217; profiles online. Read reviews from clients and photos of their past projects to see whether they might be a good fit.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decide which contractors you’d like to set up a meeting with and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for an on-site visit</a>. An in-person visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and the limitations of the space. You&#8217;ll also see if personalities and communication styles mesh. You should expect a written bid within 5-7 business days after your visit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40132 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast! This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primer</a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with Sweeten to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.</p>
<h3>STEP 5: Sign a contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an outline of the costs, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h3>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps where hiccups or delays might occur, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and necessary approvals have held up many a renovation, but don’t be daunted. Sweeten contractors are well-versed in navigating these processes and often can advise you on how to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you’re moving plumbing or gas lines, you’ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple months.</p>
<p>If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals. However, you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure everything is up to code.</p>
<h3>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.</p>
<h3>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and alert them. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight! It doesn’t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!</p>
<h3>CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening and when. It is vital to make the scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract) so the project can keep moving forward. Also, keep your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction. </em></p>
<h3>STEP 9: It’s demo time (1-2 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time (for your contractor) to pick up that sledgehammer. Items that are staying should be protected with tarp or plastic. Depending on how large your kitchen is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn’t take more than a day or two.</p>
<h3>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (1-4 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the space stripped down to the studs, new plumbing or electrical can be placed where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans need to be altered now that you can see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1 hour on-site)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits, inspections and a final sign-off may be needed before the walls are closed up, particularly with gas lines. <span class="s1">While it may take the inspector an hour to do his job at the site, scheduling the actual appointment could take days or weeks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A master plumber is typically allowed to sign off on pipework for water lines if the city inspector doesn&#8217;t show up. However, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project before this inspection happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete. They will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. Sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times. </p>
<h3>STEP 12: Installation &#8211; floors (1-5 days)</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure the flooring you choose is consistent throughout the room, even if they’re hidden. If you decide in the future to reconfigure the cabinet layout, the floors won’t need to be redone.</p>
<h3>STEP 13: Installation &#8211; all other material including cabinets and appliances (1-10 days)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation of all other materials is usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware. Aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions, and the arrival time of the materials.</p>
<h3>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts allow that the space is left in a “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hire post-construction cleaning specialists</a> to ensure it is cleaned to your specifications.</p>
<h3>POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASE</h3>
<h3>STEP 15: Final walk-through with your contractor (30-60 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point them out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, advises to keep notepads in each space, and not speak to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.</p>
<h3>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)</h3>
<p class="p1">Punch list items can be issues from straightening a cabinet door to waiting on installing that last out-of-stock item. Completing the punch list can take anywhere from a day to several weeks. When it’s on the long side, though, that is usually due to items being back-ordered. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h3>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the last item on your punch list has been addressed, the remaining payment is paid to your contractor and the project is complete. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This timeline is meant to give you a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and typical time ranges. Factors that may be outside of both your and the contractor’s control should be taken into account. In general, Sweeten renovators report that their kitchen renovations are completed between three weeks to two months (depending on the level of complexity). The key to staying on track is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles and allotting more time to get them done.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Typically, a kitchen remodel will take anywhere from three weeks to four months to complete, depending on several factors, including the project complexity, the size of your kitchen, and your requested scope of work. Timelines may be extended for reasons like delays in material delivery, change orders, and discoveries unearthed during demo or construction (such as leaks, mold, or faulty wiring.)</p>
