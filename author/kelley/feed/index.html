<h3>Remodeling an outdated 80&#8217;s West Village kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36013 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36010 size-full" title="jonathan-standing-in-kitchen-with-wife" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg" alt="jonathan standing in his kitchen with his wife in front of white kitchen cabinets and herringbone pattern subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="waterfall-marble-island-with-pendant-lights"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pendant lights and white walls after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36013 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-36018 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-36018 size-full" title="waterfall-kitchen-island-with-cabinet-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor and waterfall marble island with pull out drawers inside cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">An empty room becomes a handicap accessible bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The family has lived in their colonial home in Saint Albans, Queens since 1975. The space was working for most of them, but the daughters’ aging mother needed a one-floor living situation so she wouldn’t have to go up and down the stairs to use the bathroom or kitchen. That meant converting an extra room on the first floor into a senior-friendly bathroom adjacent to her bedroom.</p>

<h3>Adding a walk-in shower and ADA-compliant toliet</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the room was demolished, reframed, and equipped for plumbing, the family worked together to choose materials and products for the bathroom. The biggest consideration was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass-encased</a> shower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="ADA bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44061 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-08-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="accessible bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35991 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to build the frame for the shower, it was initially discussed that one of the back windows would have to be blocked off. Their contractor found another solution, adding a tiled extension off the existing half wall to support the glass.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35996 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Adjusting to make more room</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The radiator had to move down closer to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> to make room, too. The contractor also ensured the shower entry was large enough to fit a shower chair and made the entry curbless.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="curbless shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35995 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-10-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Other accessible features included the disability bar inside, as well as the handle on the outside of the shower. The daughters wanted a convenient place for their mother to be able to hang her robe, so the contractor added a robe hook just outside the glass door.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="aging in place bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35992 size-full" style="text-align: justify;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Accessibility is key</h3>
<p>As for the other details, they decided on a cabinet vanity instead of a pedestal sink to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize storage</a>, built a niche on the adjacent wall, and installed a higher, comfort-height 17-inch toilet that matches ADA-compliant standards. Accessibility was the most important consideration throughout the project and that need was definitely met. “Our contractor did a great job overall,” the family shared. “He came up with solutions and we worked through different ideas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="accessible bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-35997 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Their contractor installed an easy-to-slide pocket door between the bedroom and bathroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Making a stylish storage statement one shelf at a time</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upper cabinets have long been a mainstay in kitchen design and frankly, always will be. But there’s something to be said for open shelves: they make a kitchen feel lighter, more effortless, and more open. Plus, they pretty much force you to stay organized because there’s nothing for clutter to hide behind. See how Sweeten renovators incorporated the look into their own culinary spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A touch of Scandinavian</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" title="brown-kitchen-island-metal-chairs" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44319 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Melissa-After.jpg" alt="brown kitchen island with metal chairs and white subway tiled kitchen and kitchen cabinets after renovation" width="4500" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Melissa-After.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Melissa-After-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Melissa-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 4500px) 100vw, 4500px" />This homeowner wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/mid-century-scandinavian-kitchen-renovation/"><span class="s3">&#8220;mid-century Scandi meets &#8217;70s Italian modern&#8221;</span></a> kitchen. Clean lines and leaving the space as open as possible achieved this look. Custom-made floating shelves behind the peninsula, and all along the sink wall, do the trick. They provide plenty of storage for everyday items and decorative accessories without overwhelming the kitchen.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Topping the backsplash<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="open shelves kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open shelves kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom wood shelves run along one wall of Sheilaja and Sergio’s galley kitchen. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/"><span class="s2">provide a nice contrast</span></a> to the all-white palette. Plus, they hold books and artwork that bring a personal touch to the cook space.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Storage for space and air<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37963 mb-0 mt-24 size-full" title="open shelves kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, living room, design, construction, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-08-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This tiny kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/"><span class="s2">looks much bigger</span></a> than it is thanks to the exposed back wall anchored with white oak shelves. Upper cabinets have suffocated the space; instead, light from the living area streams in filling.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Shelving for tight corners<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32896 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="open shelves kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14.jpg" alt="open shelves kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bellamy and Zak’s kitchen presented a few design challenges. A door for backyard access was needed as well as space to accommodate &#8220;must-have&#8221; double ovens. All said and done, there wasn’t a ton of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/"><span class="s2">remaining wall space for more upper cabinets,</span></a> so instead the couple chose shelves to host ingredients and dishware.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Standout hardware</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reconfiguring the kitchen layout allowed Jeremy and Chris to extend the cabinetry and add an integrated refrigerator on one wall. The opposite one would host a banquette, sink, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/"><span class="s2">long open shelves</span></a>. In addition to keeping the space from feeling too enclosed, the shelves show off the Carrara marble backsplash.</span></p>

To make up for the lack of storage from closed cabinets, she opted for shelves on the opposite wall that frames a walk-in pantry.</span></p>

<h2>In smaller bathrooms, a bathtub to shower conversion saves space</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>This bathroom refresh tops the wishlist</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love walk-in showers, you’re not alone. A larger shower area, easy entry, and a streamlined look make walk-in showers an attractive choice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to move forward on a bathtub to shower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is closely connected to lifestyle. For example, a family with small children may want to keep a bathtub if there is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only one bathroom. Accessibility for limited mobility is another reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re already planning an overall bathroom remodel, this is a good time to consider whether swapping the tub for a shower makes sense.</span><span class="s1"> Discuss with your contractor if your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">For a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub to shower conversion</a> consider shower size, windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of plumbing. </span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Find inspiration from these Sweeten homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">made the change</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments— for free.</span></p>
<h3>Gaining a more useful shower</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a second bathroom in their Upper East Side co-op, Laura and Randy had to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximize their one bath</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They removed the pretty, but impractical, bathtub. And they installed a modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>—with three different shower heads and a seat.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="whie-bathtub-white-pedestal-sink" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2.jpg" alt="white bathtub with white pedestal sink in a small bathroom with penny tiles before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new supercharged shower</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Meg and Brett already had a spacious glass shower/tub combination in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft apartment</a>. However, by removing the tub, they added several more layers to create a luxurious experience. A low curb reveals a patterned floor tile for a two-person shower. Double shower heads, body sprays, and a rain shower complete the upgraded vista.</span></p>
<div></div>

<h3>Accessibility with style</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary reason for Mickey’s remodel was to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom shower</a>. Looking towards retirement and possible limited mobility, he replaced the high-walled tub with a walk-in shower. His Sweeten contractor handled all of the paperwork for the co-op board approval so Mickey was able to focus on choosing materials.</span></p>
<div></div>

<h3>Removing an unwieldy fixture</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charon and Lex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment bathtub</a> took up too much space; i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t took up almost the whole room. The new shower with the glass door makes the room feel huge without the bulk. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Replacing a bathtub for a standing shower leaves this space feeling spacious and streamlined" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A new layout with lots of personality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by her own parent’s accessibility updates, Megan and Zak decided to follow suit when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating their guest bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They converted the old bathtub to a standing shower and opted for no glass doors.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-toilet" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white toilet and double hung window before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Setting bathroom priorities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the small, pink tub in Giulia’s bath was the best way to get more space for a larger sink. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She designed an</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was shorter than the original tub, making more room for a larger vanity and mirror.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-shower-curtain-pink-bathtub" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6.jpg" alt="white shower curtain over a pink bathtub and small bathroom with white toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48158" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7Bathtub-6-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37965 size-full" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-10.jpg" alt="After bathtub to shower conversion, this homeowner had room for an extra-large sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-10-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Safety first</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Elaine, safety was paramount. When undergoing the bathtub to shower conversion, she tasked her Sweeten contractor with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/brooklyn-bathroom-staying-in-place-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walk-in shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with accessible features: a hand bar and shower, plus a rough stone floor for traction.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Update a kitchen with low-grade materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jen rented in neighborhoods across Brooklyn for 10 years before she bought her first apartment in a 1937 Crown Heights co-op building. She fell in love with how open the space was—with the exception of the tight, closed-in kitchen. The kitchen was recently renovated, but with cheaper, run-of-the-mill materials that didn’t quite match Jen’s style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a huge fan of the simple, Scandinavian vibe,&#8221; she said. (Think: neutral calming colors, simple design, and warm touches for that <a href="https://www.hyggelife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hygge life</a>). Jen purchased the 950-square-foot apartment with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intention to renovate</a> but decided to wait to get a better sense of how’d she use it.</p>

<h3>Opening up the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I had a pretty clear vision of the aesthetics and giving myself that extra year solidified those design decisions. My sofa faces the kitchen, so I&#8217;d spend more hours than I&#8217;d like to admit looking at it and imagining what I&#8217;d do,” Jen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35187" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the kitchen had an opening to the living room, it still felt closed off to the rest of the apartment because its working surfaces were behind a wall. &#8220;A weird empty space in the left part of the kitchen was supposed to be an eat-in area, but I was never going to use it for that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35184" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3>Adding a peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors removed a wall came down and replaced it with a peninsula to connect the kitchen and living room. Instead of building out full upper cabinets, Jen opted for open shelving for an airy feel. She also took advantage of the extra space on the left side of the kitchen to add more base cabinetry. “Though I heard my share of conflicting opinions about open shelving, I’m so glad I stuck to my guns,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35181" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old flooring was replaced with wood</a> to match the living area. An integrated dishwasher and counter-depth fridge were installed for that European vibe. Jen did wind up compromising on a built-in gas cooktop and wall oven due to electrical restrictions. However, she ultimately attained the Scandinavian-minimal look she was aiming for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35188" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-07-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Finding tips and tricks for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With her Crown Heights kitchen renovation behind her, Jen offers a few words of wisdom. For one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start putting together a materials list</a> before you even hire a contractor. Jen assembled a spreadsheet with everything from appliances to light fixtures to track items she loved, and see if they went on sale. (Tip: Jen browsed Sweeten reno posts and their detailed source lists to find items!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She loved the transformation so much, choosing a favorite element was nearly impossible. “Is it cheating if I say the entire kitchen [is my favorite?] I’m still stunned by how transformed the space is with the wall gone.” She added, &#8220;Frankly, I never want to leave my apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jen recommends adding drawers to base cabinets for easier access to dishes. “I&#8217;m a shorty, so having all my dishes in drawers, instead of having to reach for them on my tippy toes, has been awesome,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Chic <em>and</em> cost-effective? Yes, please! 7 renovations show how to style Ikea kitchen cabinets to make that happen.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from closets, kitchen cabinets represent one of the larger concentrations of millwork and storage designed to keep spaces organized and clutter out of sight. Whether modern or traditional or navy blue or natural wood, the cabinets you choose will have an impact on the look and feel you want your kitchen to portray. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some homeowners choose to go fully custom, some opt for stock cabinets, and sometimes it’s a mix. To assist in your research, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has rounded up a few of our renovators’ kitchens. Here, the thinking behind their decision to incorporate Ikea cabinets into their cook spaces with the help of their Sweeten contractors.</span></p>
<h3><b>For High Gloss Glamour</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44120" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavanya and Regis’s gallery-style kitchen got a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major style overhaul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during their railroad-style apartment renovation. To make the main rooms bright and airy, they chose glossy white Ikea kitchen cabinets to complement their high-gloss, white-painted wood floors.</span></p>
<h3><b>Go Low on Cost, High on Style </b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40345 size-full" title="Ikea kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="Ikea kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full disclosure: Sally’s kitchen is a mix of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikea Sektion bases and custom door fronts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Scherr’s. It’s a great example of how to get a bespoke look for less—and saved the renovator (she has four under her belt!) $25,000.</span></p>
<h3><b>For Euro-Industrial</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uldis and Serge, Europeans-turned-New Yorkers, mixed contrasting colors and finishes with their styled Ikea kitchen cabinets to create a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Euro-Industrial feel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their upper kitchen upper cabinets, which were a high gloss white, integrated smoothly with the stainless steel cabinets on the bottom. The end result? A sleek kitchen that doesn’t sacrifice fashion for function. </span></p>
<h3><b>To Go Scandinavian Sleek</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35182 size-full" title="Ikea kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1.jpg" alt="Ikea kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen loves the Scandi-look, so when it came to renovating her kitchen, Ikea kitchen cabinets were a must. She chose the Veddinge cabinet front doors and minimalistic tab pulls to create an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfussy and practical cook space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with major hygge vibes. </span></p>
<h3><b>For Expanded Pantry Space</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="built-in-white-kitchen-storage" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44171 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-12.jpg" alt="built in white kitchen storage and dark brown floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We never thought pantry storage would become the crown jewel of a kitchen&#8230;but then we saw </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Brooklyn kitchen</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With wraparound, floor-to-ceiling shelving, including full-height 15&#8243; upper Ikea kitchen cabinets, their multi-generational home has enough kitchen storage for all the family members. </span></p>
<h2><b>To Complement Hero Pieces</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" title="Ikea kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="Ikea kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Manhattan loft this awe-inspiring with high ceilings and windows, it’s best to pick one or two show-stopping features. For this renovator, that meant the home’s original bones and a standout Carrara marble countertop and backsplash. So, when it came to styling his kitchen cabinets, he chose gray-blue Ikea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complement the rest of the apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>To Be Sustainable</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37239 size-full" title="Ikea kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="Ikea kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael chose their Bodbyn style Ikea kitchen cabinets </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a few reasons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had originally planned to use reclaimed cabinetry, but given the kitchen’s tight layout, they needed a narrower option. “We</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to go with Ikea because we felt they offered the best sustainable options and price,” Sandra shared. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ashleigh and Jonathan were renting an apartment in the Financial District of Manhattan while leasing out their own house in New Jersey, when they decided they’d rather own their everyday home. The couple sold their place across the river with the intention of buying an apartment in New York City. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found a 953-square-foot studio loft in DUMBO, Brooklyn, which was originally built as a soap factory in 1904. Since the place didn’t come equipped with a laundry hook up, they’d planned to have one installed to add a washer and dryer to their bathroom. Unfortunately, the couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t realize what that upgrade would involve</a>. “We had no idea that this next step would necessarily require renovation, however, we fell in love with the apartment, and figured out a way to make it work,” Ashleigh shared. </span></p>

They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who Sweeten shared was already working on another project in the same building. “That was a large factor in us deciding to go with him for the renovation,” Ashleigh said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner’s first decision? The unfinished wood vanity with a Carrara marble top. From there, they chose the aged brass and gunmetal fixtures, classic white subway tiles, and navy paint for the walls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once their contractor filed the necessary plumbing and electrical permits, all they could do, construction-wise, was wait. “He assured us that he was doing everything he could to make this happen and stayed in constant communication, keeping us informed on how things were progressing with our permits, as well as letting us know when he needed certain items for installation,” Ashleigh said. Once they came through, he had a month less than planned to complete the project—but all-in-all the renovation wrapped up just two days behind schedule. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t exactly Ashleigh and Jonathan’s first renovation—but their first with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a licensed general contractor</a>. “His experience and expertise helped guide us through the process,” Ashleigh said. Sweeten reached out during the process and offered assistance, but the couple noted they actually didn’t need any further help and that everything was moving along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We absolutely love our new bathroom. Given the limited space, it suits our needs and style perfectly. We&#8217;ve lived with and without a washer/dryer and much prefer life with one, so the fact that we could solve that problem with the apartment makes it infinitely more livable for us.” Ashleigh said.</span></p>

<h3>From Manhattan to a tighter-knit neighborhood</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of events, including a new job, took Anita from Manhattan’s Chelsea to a co-op in Jackson Heights. “I wanted to live somewhere where I felt part of a community and that my connections could really make a difference. I also left the private sector for the nonprofit world,” she shared. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57122 size-full" title="Sweeten renovator portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new 850-square-foot apartment in a 1950s building was the right fit for her reimagined life—minus the kitchen. “I knew I’d gut renovate the kitchen the second I saw it,” Anita said. She’d been living simply (with just a bed and kitchen table) in the apartment for three months when she embarked on her first renovation. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he project was posted to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sweeten and was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a selection of vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Queens</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3>A white and wood kitchen for gathering</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita’s mission for the bland and dated space? To create a warm and modern room with plenty of storage and room to host friends. There were no outlets along the entire counter wall either, so updating the electrical panel was essential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57114 size-full" title="white-and-wood-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Two-tone white and wood kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57115 size-full" title="wood-cabinets-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="kitchen with white walls and natural wood cabinets and floating shelf and stainless steel appliances and floor tiling after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita used Ikea’s kitchen planning tool, working with an Ikea designer to measure the kitchen and select all of the materials she needed to order. Pairing a simple contrast of colors, this combination offered an interesting spin on traditional design for added visual appeal. The dual finishes even carried over into the drawer-within-drawer system for a coordinated look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her years spent living in Germany (where she says everyone renovates kitchens, even in rentals) inspired the appliance choices, as did prior work experience. “I had also worked in refrigeration for vaccines in developing countries and know way too much about refrigerators,” Anita said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking out kitchen floor tile proved to be a more difficult decision. Her contractor recommended a supplier in Queens where, after several trips, she found a cement-look tile made in Italy.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57124 size-full" title="pull-out-cabinet-drawers-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kithen-02.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>The right contractor is in sync with their client</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, Anita worried most about timing, budget, and working with a professional she could trust. Her Sweeten contractor delivered on all three, offering a reasonable estimate based on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>, a clear timeline from the get-go, and following through during the project. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M46pF7SpsME" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My contractor sent me to reputable places priced within my budget that had items in stock. So, I didn&#8217;t have to rely on catalog pictures or internet images. He also respected my budget but knew when to push me toward better quality items or when simpler materials would suffice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of his best traits was being really good at reading people. He knew when my freaking out was legitimate and when I was falling into a trap of keeping up with the next big trend.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s team was also respectful of the building, taking the right precautions and cleaning up every day. Anita said her building super still compliments them on their professionalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she has a brand new kitchen, where she can throw “kitchen parties,” sip wine, and just enjoy the space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Whether they work simultaneously or on different timelines, their goal is one and the same</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind every renovation is a hardworking team that’s striving for one thing: executing a successful project. Homeowners come to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who can reimagine their homes and sometimes bring along an interior designer who can help them visualize the new space. Other times, interior designers come directly to Sweeten to hire a general contractor for their clients’ projects. How a designer and contractor work together on a project varies case-by-case, sometimes they’re involved from the get-go, and other times a designer will come in post-construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General contractors are essential to our work,” said <a href="https://www.nysid.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NYSID</a> faculty member Harry Heissmann. “While we can dream up and lay out rooms and houses, we need help executing our vision and while all of us are perfectly capable of supervising a job, the GC takes a lot of pressure off and organizes the different trades on a job according to a schedule. I always create an atmosphere of mutual respect right at the beginning, which in turn can make miracles happen.” See how these renovators partnered with a general contractor and designer to create their home sweet homes. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dream came true for actor Danielle Brooks, who plays Taystee on the Netflix hit show <em>Orange is the New Black</em>: She owned her first home by the age of 30. Eager to make her mark in her new Brooklyn brownstone, she approached interior design duo, Jeanine Hays and Bryan Mason of <a href="https://www.aphrochic.com/">AphroChic</a> to meld her love of color, her draw to cultural heritage, and her sense of glamour. With a vision in place, the designers tapped Sweeten to find a general contractor who would set the stage with distinct Moroccan lighting, a sultry master bedroom painted in black, and African-inspired art. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Dianna and Todd had long been planning to renovate their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">440-square-foot apartment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a roof-top blaze is what got their plans underway. They came to Sweeten to find a general contractor who amongst many things, advised on where to focus their attention, from refreshing the cabinetry instead of replacing it, to restaining and sanding the existing wood floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the renovation was complete, they brought in interior designer Julia Oddo of </span><a href="https://www.tcinteriordesign.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Interiors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who created a scheme to complement the material choices—tans, blacks, and whites—the couple had already made with their contractor. In this case, the designer and the contractor were not working hand-in-hand throughout the project, but still wanted to create a great home for their client.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica traded a Pepto-pink bathroom for a blush and chic retreat. Her renovation team, a Sweeten general contractor and interior designer </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy E. Bishop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined forces to revamp her Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, bath. Amy came up with design ideas, like the cascading statement wall and in-shower shelving, while the contractor brought them to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the built-in shelves were supposed to be on a different wall, but after the contractor discovered the wall was solid cement, the team reconsidered the location, moving the niches to the back wall instead. The renovation was a collaboration between all parties and resulted in a relaxing space for Erica.</span></p>

Originally, the kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area, making it dark and cramped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to knock down the walls and let the light in from the living room windows. A mix of reflective and refractive materials help harness that light, too. Danielle, the principal and founder of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persephone Spring</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked hand-in-hand with the contractor to translate the vision, and select finishes from paint color to tile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowners’ </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three-bedroom apartment in the Kips Bay Towers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been through a renovation before, but thirty years later the time had come for another refresh. The owners’ called on interior designer </span><a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tara Benet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who then turned to Sweeten to hire a contractor to refresh what had become a tired and outdated space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From refinishing the floors to repainting the walls a slightly orange-tinted white and touching up millwork, the Sweeten general contractor created a new canvas for Tara to embellish with luxe furniture, lighting, and accessories.</span></p>

Melissa and Russ were inspired by the seamlessly integrated kitchen they’d designed and their unique approach to open layouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Miller Atre conceived an idea that made each space feel distinct but connected and the general contractor executed their vision, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building out custom cabinetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and covering up once-exposed brick walls.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41941 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Create a clean and classic kitchen </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As soon as Jo moved into her Sutton Place home, she knew a kitchen renovation was in order. The space was disconnected and closed-off from the rest of the one-bedroom apartment, and the tall metal cabinets from the 1950s were impractical. As a product designer, she planned to be very hands-on with material selection, most of which would be neutral so that her colorful dishware could pop. “I’m very changeable in terms of my taste, I’m always looking to update my home accessories,” Jo shared. Before contacting Sweeten, she actually removed the tile floors herself. From there, she </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28119" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3803" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41952 size-full" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-During-02.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-During-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Helene-Weiss-Kitchen-During-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: To better connect the kitchen to the rest of the home, Jo’s contractor created a look-through window in the wall that was blocking it off. Jo would’ve preferred to knock down the whole wall, but the building’s intercom system kept them from doing so. It ended up being the perfect spot to display plants!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jo focused her creative energy on curating materials, from the flooring to the appliances. She took inspiration from her travels. In Portugal, she discovered that cork was a popular flooring choice. It’s easy to clean, matches with parquet floors in her apartment, and is also very forgiving (Jo has dropped dishes from five feet or so off the ground—without them breaking!). The bamboo shelves, one that serves as a drying rack above the sink (</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to this renovator’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), were a play off of what she’d seen in Europe, too. Jo ordered the shelves, made some design modifications, and had her contractor execute the plans, sealing them to receive wet dishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was Jo’s third renovation, so she came to the table with plenty of experience—and advice for first-timers. Namely, write everything down! Communication discrepancies are natural, so the best way to avoid them is to put everything in an email—and send follow-ups as needed. “I took the entire contract and expanded on it, because I didn’t want there to be any gaps,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her attention to detail paid off: “I love being in the new space, it’s enabled me to have more family celebrations.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>No clutter in sight</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is bare better? For these homeowners, who all renovated with a Sweeten general contractor, the answer is most definitely, yes. They wished for kitchens where the color palette stayed light and bright, and the storage was both expanded—and hidden. Check out their remodeled cook spaces below. </span></p>

A hidden range hood and refrigerator, plus deep storage drawers do the trick.</span></p>

That drove the vision for this </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/44-square-foot-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">44-square-foot kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that maximizes the minimalist look with flat-paneled cabinets and pull-tab hardware.</span></p>

The key? A single-tone color palette and very organized accessories.</span></p>

Cooking supplies are hidden away in the many cabinets (the homeowner’s even said, “sometimes it feels like we have too much kitchen storage”) which is why it looks so streamlined. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A 1960s East Hampton kitchen renovation</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ann was looking for a contractor for over two years to renovate the kitchen in her East Hampton, New York, home. She just couldn’t find the right fit—price-or-quality-wise. Her dark and dated kitchen, in a one-story house built in 1964, had a faux brick backsplash and the original cabinetry. It just wasn’t cutting it for Ann, a big entertainer, with lots of family members who love to come over and cook. However, after finding Sweeten and reading other renovation stories on the blog, she made a move and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her kitchen renovation project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with an East Hampton contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’d help turn the old-fashioned kitchen into host-worthy space.<br />

Daniel drew up the plans for an open kitchen, including removing the wall between the dining area and cook space and lifting the ceiling to a cathedral style (which was the contractor’s suggestion). Fortunately, those changes had a dramatic effect on the brightness and size of the room. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner wanted a very timeless aesthetic. Flat-paneled white cabinets set the foundation for the classic look, complemented by white, taupe, and black granite countertops and gold cabinet hardware. Lighting above the island and the black-and-gold sink faucet echo the metallic hardware, tying it all together.</span></p>

As a first-time renovator, Ann was happy to have Sweeten Client Services available throughout the project. “It was great to know somebody was there for you,” she shared. She also had a great time working with her contractor, who encouraged her to take time picking out the materials. Above all, he told her to not rush it—a renovation is not something that’s done every day. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2UW0nGOQ_M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patience was Ann’s main focus from the very start, since she waited to find a contractor she felt confident in. The homeowner suggests that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">future renovators do the same: shop around, speak with as many people as you can, and do research. This isn’t a process worth speeding through!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>They stepped up to make the renovator’s experience the best it could be</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you post your project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, you get the guarantee of a contractor who’s licensed, vetted for their quality of work, and matched to your specific renovation. Sweeten general contractors are there to manage your project from start to completion and make sure you not only have the finished product of a home, sweet home, but a smooth experience getting there, too. While there may be bumps in the road, it&#8217;s the experience that a good contractor has to navigate the potholes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re impressed every day by the work the contractors in our network do! Ahead, we highlight a few of many instances where Sweeten contractors came through for their renovators in a big way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40489" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Mimi’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When the homeowner had a vacation booked. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was especially glad I found a contractor I could trust because I had actually preplanned a three-week-long vacation overseas before I knew I was going to be in the middle of renovations (and ended up breaking my phone two days in!). I was a bit nervous leaving right in the middle of all of the construction, but my Sweeten contractor gave me a lot of confidence that the project could proceed without me. So I picked out all of the finishes I wanted, ordered the fixtures, packed my bags and left right in the middle of the project. Sure enough, by the time I got back, the job was nearly complete!”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Gayle’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-childhood-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When family comes first.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I never felt like I was out of the loop on what was going on with our contractor and his team. Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn’t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn’t stop.”</span></p>

<p><b>When they acted as a “neighbor whisperer.” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general contractor went door to door with his client to alert neighbors of a plumbing situation, relieving the client of her anxiety and showing enormous support: “Our contractor went with us to each unit to explain what would happen even though they were not the ones replacing the plumbing. Magically, we easily got everyone’s agreement once they were told the entire situation.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40909" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Allyson’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/eclectic-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When the homeowner had a very clear vision.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allyson’s plan for her bathroom was anything but cookie-cutter and involved a lot of coordination to ensure the materials were the right size and came in on time. “My contractor was patient and never dismissed my ideas as ridiculous or impossible. If something wasn’t how I liked it, he made sure that it was corrected. Because a lot of the items I wanted to use came from outside of the country, he worked around my undependable delivery schedule.  He took a potentially stressful situation and provided steady guidance and expertise.” </span></p>

<p><b>When a renovation required a little “hacking.” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel wanted to make a lot of modifications to an Ikea kitchen system—including integrated appliances. The couple spent so much time searching for a refrigerator that could fit into what was formerly a coat closet, and their contractor cut custom panels to cover it. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work. He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A year and a half into owning and living in their Riverdale, Bronx, home Elizabeth and Martin were ready to renovate their 124-square-foot galley kitchen. Inspired by other remodeled kitchens in their 1955 co-op building, they got an idea for how they could transform the layout to better suit their needs. Elizabeth, a research analyst for a public policy consulting firm, and Martin, a product designer for a video streaming company, posted their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project on Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a design-build firm</span></a> where they worked with both a designer and a contractor.</p>

Knocking down walls between the kitchen and the entryway area to bring in more natural light. Their contractor also took down a partial wall between the kitchen and dining space to connect them. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen. We wouldn’t have felt as confident in our decision making in this area, but having the designer’s expertise and experience to make layout recommendations and to see her sketches (from every angle!) of the design made us comfortable with the plan, “ Elizabeth shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators wanted a clean and classic kitchen with plenty of prep space and minimal clutter. They worked with the designer to come up with practical storage solutions, including a set of glass-front cabinets, microwave cabinet, and built-in paper towel holder. The peninsula breakfast bar seats four to six and offers additional storage, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth and Martin shopped with their designer to pick out materials, including the lava stone backsplash and quartz countertop. Copper cabinet hardware pops against the white custom cabinets and adds to the mix of metals (matte black for the sink faucet and stainless steel appliances).</span></p>

Our contractor helped by providing a detailed scope of work and being communicative and responsive to emails throughout the project.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They relied on Sweeten from the get-go for reviewing and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leveling quotes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, most importantly, “knowing Sweeten was available and present to step in if needed, offered us a lot of peace of mind throughout the planning and execution of our renovation,” Elizabeth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their new space reinvigorated Martin&#8217;s love for cooking and unlike pre-renovation, the couple actually enjoys spending time together in their kitchen now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The couple adopted a cat, Norah J., as their renovation wrapped up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly 25 years ago, the homeowners were on the hunt for a three-bedroom rental with more space for their two children—who’d long been sharing a bedroom. They stumbled upon a Chelsea apartment, converted from a factory space, that was actually for sale. They agreed to go through with buying their first place—where they’ve lived ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the couple had their kitchen renovated, but left every other room intact—until they decided to remodel the guest bathroom. “It was embarrassingly retro. The faucets didn’t work, there was a gap behind the sink. It just looked old,” they shared. Another priority? To convert the bathtub into a walk-in shower. “My dad, who is in his 90s, stays with us a lot, too,” one of the homeowners shared, so that update was especially important to give him easier access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4845#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who would provide design and build help to modernize the space. Guidance picking out and sourcing materials was the main factor in their decision. “Other contractors facilitate the project, file the permits, demolish, install, etc—but then I would’ve had to go find the sink, the toilet, the faucet. This contractor offered to help us find all of our materials, it was part of their service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-wall-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48774 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom wall tiles with white pedestal sink along with white bathtub and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sara-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before work could begin, the building’s co-op board engineer presented a list of possible requirements, from waterproofing to disability access.  The contractor had to apply for a lot of permits, and at one point in the process, the Sweeten Client Services team stepped in to facilitate an issue and get communication between the homeowner and contractor back on the right track.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNuCmtu1M8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the approval and permits were all set, the couple and their Sweeten contractor got to work on finding materials that aligned with their vision of a clean, classic black-and-white bathroom. They all went to a showroom together to see what caught the renovators’ eyes, including a dotted marble floor tile. The homeowners love natural stone material, so they opted for a Calacatta porcelain tile for the shower walls. The vanity is a custom piece that ties in the bi-tonal color palette and offers plenty of storage. An offset sink (we’re seeing more and more of these) lends one side of the counter for more storage, too.</span></p>

The contractor&#8217;s designer was the perfect partner for us,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contracting team was diligent about cleaning up the dust every single day since the homeowners were living at home during the renovation. The guest bathroom is near the entryway and was cordoned off for construction. “They all took the job seriously, completed the job with meticulous work, and got it done pretty quickly. We saw real care,” the homeowners said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the timeline shifted a bit given the board approval challenges, once the process got rolling, it was finished in six weeks (and just in time for a birthday party the couple was hosting.) </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovators were so amazed by the hard work of each subcontractor that handled the demolition, electrical, lighting, and tiling. “I was struck by the uniformly high quality no matter which team it was,” one homeowner shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bianco Carrara black dot marble mosaic floor tile; floor stone border in black polished marble; FAP Lumin white matte wall tile 10”x 30”; Fondovalle Calacatta porcelain shower tiles: </span><a href="https://www.tilesbykia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiles by Kia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3>You’ll want to snag these tricks for your own remodel</h3>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may think there’s only so much you can do to make a bathroom look different or be more efficient. After all, it’s a space that always has the same, standard features: a sink, a bathtub/shower, and a toilet. We’re here to tell you: that’s absolutely not the case. In the many projects our renovators share with us every day, there’s always an innovative idea or a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mix of materials</a> we wish we’d thought of ourselves! Ahead, seven such ideas to inspire your own bathroom remodel.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Extend floor tile to the base of the wall</strong><br />
This classic bathroom is full of unique design details, including the extension of the floor tile onto the base of the walls. The contractor suggested the idea to renovators Jeremy and Chris to stretch the visual plane of the room—and it definitely did the trick. See their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation here</a>.</p>
<p><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg" alt="black and white bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48624" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<p><b>2. Use pool tiles for a shower<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Who says you can only use bathroom tiles in a bathroom? Exactly. Allyson sourced aqua pool tiles with a wind-blown texture for her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">walk-in shower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that make showering feel like a dip in the pool.

<p><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43104 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BathReno-Timing-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg" alt="how long does a bath reno take" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BathReno-Timing-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BathReno-Timing-BlogPost-Embed-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BathReno-Timing-BlogPost-Embed-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. <b>Work with, not against, structural and plumbing challenges<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things you can work around in a renovation and often, pipes aren’t one of them (especially if they’re risers). In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/simple-elegance-returns-to-the-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angela’s </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom renovation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her contractor made use of space that would’ve otherwise been dead and installed covert shelves for toilet paper and towels.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33589 mb-0 size-full" title="open-marble-shelves-white-bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1.jpg" alt="open marble shelves in a white bathroom with subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Angela_DeVeaugh-Geiss_Residence-05-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Install a swinging shower door<br />
</strong><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shower doors: some slide, some stay put, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this one swings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The smart solution allows the door to glide over the toilet, making cleaning and access to the tub fixtures, easier. Read more on how <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonya and Aaron made the best use</a> of their 42-square-foot bathroom.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40322 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-02.gif" alt="bathroom " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Instead of centering a sink, offset it</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s pretty standard to place a sink at the center of a countertop or vanity. Setting it to the side, however, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserves counter space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as seen in one Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/luxe-bathroom-remodel-west-village-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowner’s renovation</a>. Sometimes symmetry isn’t the answer!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39740 mt-24 size-full" title="marble-countertop-wall-tiles-and-brass-faucet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="wood bathroom vanity with white marble countertop and undermount sink with brass faucet and white marble tiles on wall and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>6. </strong><b>Create a custom shelf for toilet paper<br />
</b>Never will you have to go hunting for a new roll when it&#8217;s placed strategically next to the toilet, like in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1930s-westchester-tudor-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara and Mike’s rustic bathroom</a>. Plus, it frees up space in linen or storage closets for towels and cleaning supplies.</p>

<p><strong>7. </strong><b>Install recessed cabinets behind the door<br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there’s no room for shelves or a standard cabinet, recessed cabinets like in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dianna and Todd’s bathroom</a>, are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another storage option</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other perks: they don’t get in the way of the door when it’s opened and blend into the surrounding wall. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After years of living with roommates, the renters saved up to buy a place of their own: a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in Flushing, Queens. As new homeowners who finally had the option to make their mark on a space, they decided to renovate the kitchen. It was cramped and inefficient for cooking, with unusable corner cabinets and appliances that were too close together. The couple hired an architect, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/troupesong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumi Song</a>, who sketched out a few ideas based on their planned use of the space. “They also had a Pinterest page of design items they liked, and I used that as a reference for how to select finishes—they wanted a modern feel with a muted palette,” Jumi shared. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/36917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten on behalf of her clients and was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5310#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a> to bring the plans to life. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jumi-Song-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41576 size-full" title="kitchen-with-peninsula-island-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jumi-Song-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="kitchen with wood cabinets and peninsulla island and stainless steel appliances before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jumi-Song-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jumi-Song-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Jumi-Song-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The architect planned to turn the U-shaped kitchen into an L-shaped cook space with an island. To gain more space and give more separation between the master bedroom and kitchen, the contractor built a two-foot extension wall. The stove and sink stayed in their original location, but the refrigerator and dishwasher moved to an adjacent wall, directly across from the island, to establish a more efficient flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovators chose a mix of neutrals, from light wood-grain cabinets to a black quartz countertop. The cabinetry bases are all from Ikea and outfitted with doors from Semihandmade for a more customized result.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first-time renovators and homeowners biggest concern overall was about budget, but they stayed on track and the final number was within their price range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is much more open and inviting. I’ve never been one to hang out in the kitchen, but now I want to spend more time here,” one homeowner shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovators&#8217; advice: “Know when to stand your ground regarding your vision, and when to compromise due to unforeseen conditions or budget restraints.”</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Floor in Veranda Solids porcelain tile in Fog; Quartz slab countertops in Broadway Black; Glass mosaic tile in Green Parade: </span><a href="https://www.daltile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daltile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true their original purpose was solely functional, exposed beams have proven their worth beyond utility time and time again. Whether your home has an industrial, rustic, or contemporary feel, they up the drama and demand attention. These renovators, who all worked with </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, proved just how striking exposed beams really are, regardless if they’re original to a home or newly added. </span></p>
<h3><strong>A Tudor home returns to its roots with exposed beams</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41026" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara and Mike gave their Tudor home a modern layout when they had their contractor knock down walls and create an open concept kitchen and dining space. To bring back more of the home’s Tudor characteristics (and to provide structural support) their contractor brought in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1930s-westchester-tudor-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exposed beams that echo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rest of the woodwork.</span></p>
<h3>1929 exposed beams preserve Parisian-chic style</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40408" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg" alt="living area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s further proof that exposed beams can work for </span> any home style<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Liya and her family’s Parisian-chic home, the contractor left the original 1929 beams intact. The white walls, ceilings, and beams create a crisp and clean look that contrasts with the dark wood floors and charcoal furnishings.</span></p>
<h3>An industrial, clean take on beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20051 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A renovation surprise may not always be a good thing, but in the case of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ </a>Williamsburg loft remodel, it most certainly was. Their top-floor unit with a terrace, parking space, and sky-high ceilings offered another benefit: original beams. Much to the couple’s delight, their contractor proposed they open up the walls and ceiling encasing building beams in the kitchen and living room. “This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements,” Lia said.</p>
<h3>Once hidden behind walls, beams become new focal point</h3>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg and Brett’s</a> carriage home in Hamilton Heights was already chockful of historical charm, and once they exposed the original beams, it went to the next level. How they found the beams is a story in itself: “We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath,” Brett said. They came across different sets: wooden ones original to the carriage house, and iron beams installed to support the structure. “Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood,” he added.</p>
<h3>Exposed beams add character (and even out ceilings!)</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You know how the saying goes, if you don’t have it, add it. Jessica and David’s 875-square-foot apartment in Hudson Heights saw a lot of updates to make it work for their family. One stylistic addition they requested? Exposed beams. They wanted to bring more character to the space and as it turned out, the update served a dual purpose: the beams placed on the ceiling helped conceal an unfortunate spot where the ceiling was higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Recessed lighting within beams adds light, separation</strong></h3>

To turn the blank canvas into a home with more interesting detail, plus tackle a need for overhead lighting, they added non-support beams in the living room and bedroom. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The structures offered a stylish and unique lighting solution that felt inherent to the home. </span></p>
<h3>Cobble Hill home goes to new heights after finding hidden beams</h3>

It’s amazing what can be unveiled in a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel</a> set to renovate his “bland, cookie-cutter, white box” of an apartment in Cobble Hill and to his total surprise, learned it wasn’t so ordinary. The contractor was fixing some electrical issues and came across a brick wall, and then a ceiling of beautiful beams! Since the ceilings weren’t very high, Miguel decided to paint them white to make the apartment feel bigger and brighter.</p>
