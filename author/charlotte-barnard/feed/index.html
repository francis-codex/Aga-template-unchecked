			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The decorative trim of crown molding adds timeless character and visual appeal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43509 size-full" title="baseboard, crown, mantelpiece molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Molding and picture frame molding by</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;list&quot;,{},&quot;list_item&quot;,{&quot;indent&quot;:1,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numbered&quot;}]"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-25575 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">p<span class="s1">anel molding, painted a deep teal blue, gives their dining room personality.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also consider UL-Listed hollow crown molding that can hide common household wiring, good for a home office.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28325 size-chrono" title="crown molding and window casing" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(<em>Above)</em> <span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Crown molding at the top of these twin windows and panel molding below in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">brownstone</span>.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

<p>When shopping for cabinets, your lifestyle, plus the materials available, will guide and influence the appearance of your cabinet doors. Do you like the traditional Shaker-style door with its raised frame and crisp edges? Or a sleek flat-front contemporary panel? Are your kids opening and closing doors all day with sticky fingers? Or is your kitchen the entertaining hub of your home, one that you like to keep looking neat for visiting friends and family?</p>
<p>Just about any style of door panel you choose will offer a range of finishes, many of them protective. Here,<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, lays out how to choose the right kitchen cabinets.</p>
<h3>How to choose your cabinet door style</h3>
<p>Most commonly, the door is a flat panel, a raised panel, or a slab front. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>A raised panel</strong> has a raised rectangular-shaped center and the surface surrounding it is recessed, creating a frame-like appearance. The raised center may be surrounded by other detailing, such as a beveled edge, and/or an arched top, providing a traditional appearance, like antique cabinetry. This style looks beautiful with painted or stained finishes that play up the three-dimensional qualities.</p>

<p><strong>A flat panel</strong> is three-dimensional as well, but the center panel is recessed (though still flat) and framed by two stiles (rectilinear panels at either side) and two rails (panels at top and bottom). This construction is not simply decorative. It was developed (hundreds of years ago!) to keep the door shape stable with fluctuating temperatures and moisture. Popular examples are Shaker and Craftsman style. You can also find some additional variation, with a glass insert that replaces some or all of the center panel (much like a true divided light window), or a beadboard center panel for a country or cottage effect.</p>

<p><strong>A slab front</strong> is made from a single piece of material—solid hardwood, MDF, or a wood veneer. Because it is one surface with no corners or recesses to capture grime, it is easy to keep clean with the swipe of a cloth.</p>

<h3>Cabinet door materials</h3>
<p>Are you warm to wood or is a sparkling white kitchen more your craving? You can find a vast variety of looks in budget, high-end, and luxury cabinets. The rarer the material—think, solid wood—the greater the price tag. Here’s a quick guide to materials from lowest to highest price:</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) </em>Custom cabinets with a walnut and mahogany veneer and inset doors in</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kim and Ian’s kitchen</a></p>
<p><strong>MDF or medium density fiberboard</strong> is manufactured under high pressure and temperatures by combining wood fibers with a resin binder to create door panels as well as the cabinet box. Because this type of material can be manufactured efficiently from wood byproducts, it’s typically the material for stock cabinets. It takes well to paint. Manufacturers will offer different glaze options to apply on top of the paint, so you can still achieve a custom look for a stock price.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36580 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Monique-Hartl-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<ul>
<li>Thermafoil is a scratch-resistant surface that is thermally glued and vacuum-sealed to MDF. It’s an option in the stock category and great for a lifestyle where the kitchen sees a tremendous amount of activity since it’s easy to maintain. Color choice is limited to white or linen.</li>
<li>Laminate is common in countertops. With laminate cabinets, it’s still a resin-saturated printed paper (commonly a high-res photographic representation of wood) fused to a particleboard or MDF core to create the panel. This offering is available in the stock category.</li>
<li>Veneer cabinets have real wood door panels for less than the price of solid wood. The wood surface here is less than a quarter of an inch and wrapped around an MDF panel for stability—good for areas with high humidity. The risk here is that if the wood is chipped or dinged, you will see the synthetic core, and it can’t be satisfactorily repaired; however, if your cabinets don’t see a lot of hard use, this is a well-priced option in the stock category.</li>
<li>Solid wood is the high-end or luxury category for cabinet doors. Each panel is unique, like the tree it was milled from. The big decision here is what species of wood. The most common are oak, maple, hickory, and cherry. All are hardwoods with a natural beauty and all take stain or paint well. Woods that are prized for their natural color and grain, particularly hickory and cherry, shouldn’t be painted.</li>
<li>Maple is a very hard wood, with a finer grain than oak, so it’s a good choice if you want a perfectly smooth finish for paint and/or glaze. With a clear finish, it takes a contemporary look, and with a deeper stain, it becomes more traditional.</li>
<li>Birch and ash are also durable hardwoods good for kitchen cabinets with more pronounced grains. You may remember pine from your grandma’s days. You can still find this classic, and its knotty grain has a rustic appeal, but as one of the softest woods, it will dent more readily than other species.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation of door styles</h3>
<p>The style of your kitchen cabinetry doesn’t stop with the door design. How the door lays on the box also affects the overall appearance; it’s another decision you will have to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full overlay: Doors (and drawers) cover the front of the cabinet box; hinges are hidden.</li>
<li>Partial overlay: Doors cover just a portion of the face frame; hinges remain concealed.</li>
<li>Inset: Doors are flush with the face frame of the cabinet box; hinges may be concealed or exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the types of kitchen cabinets?</h3>
<p>Your selection process will begin with the door material, as it takes the brunt of the action, swinging open and shut all day, every day. Cabinet doors attach as a cover to the storage compartment they serve to conceal—typically, a box made of wood, plywood, or a wood composite. Construction offered by manufacturers, along with price, is defined by three categories:</p>
<h4>Stock cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$60/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: MDF (covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate)</li>
<li>Box material: MDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Doors and their boxes come in a limited range of standard sizes. Boxes and doors tend to be made of MDF (medium density fiberboard, which is a composite of sawdust or wood fibers with resin to bind it) and covered in thermafoil, veneer, or laminate. Available from large retailers like Home Depot or Ikea, these cabinets can be good quality but are also the thriftiest choice. Prices vary across the country, starting at about $60 per linear foot and rising to a few hundred dollars, depending on any features you add. Most major manufacturers have a stock line. You may think that there are no options for customization in this category but some brands do offer upgrades such as glass doors or a selection of molding.</p>
<h4>Semi-custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$90/ linear foot and up</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: MDF or plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>A greater range of sizes and styles according to the manufacturer’s offering. Boxes may be constructed of MDF or plywood. Solid wood doors should be part of the selection, along with MDF and veneers. Expect to pay $90 per linear foot and upward, depending on what organization features or finishes you add on. Find this category at some home centers as well as independent kitchen showrooms that carry national brands offering both semi-custom and custom, such as Wellborn or KraftMaid.</p>
<h4>Custom cabinets</h4>
<ul>
<li>$200 &#8211; $500/ linear foot</li>
<li>Door material: solid wood</li>
<li>Box material: higher quality plywood</li>
</ul>
<p>Built to order to exact size specifications. Boxes tend to be higher-quality plywood and doors are solid wood in a range of species. You may be able to find custom cabinets for under $200 per linear foot, but since everything is made to order to your exact dimensions (and will take longer to arrive at your doorstep, as much as three months, compared to five to six weeks for stock or semi-custom), the price rises considerably. You may pay as much $500 per linear foot and into the thousands for special woods and exterior details. Custom cabinetry is also available from national retailers, such as<a href="https://www.poggenpohl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Poggenpohl</a>,<a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bilotta</a>, and<a href="https://henrybuilt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Henrybuilt</a>.</p>
<p>As you survey the landscape of kitchen door panels for your cabinets, be sure to ask for samples. You may even be able to borrow a door panel from a local showroom. As with any investment for your home, you will want to try it out before you commit. Hopefully, this Sweeten guide helps you choose the perfect cabinets best suited for your needs and style.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40310 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Aaron-Blazey-Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A w<span style="font-weight: 400;">all-hung toilet in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/plumbing-changes-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners Sonya and Aaron’s Brooklyn bathroom</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a toilet may not be the very first thing you think about when imagining your dream bathroom, it is definitely a decision that requires some thought. Ahead, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors outlines how to choose the best toilet for your bathroom renovation, highlighting sizes, styles, and features (including self-cleaning bowls). </span></p>
<h3>Determine the Toilet Size</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re replacing an existing toilet, you will need to find a model that matches the rough-in—the distance from the wall to the center of the flange, the bolts that secure it to the floor. Twelve inches are standard, but you can find 10- and 14-inch models. The next measurement to consider is height. While standard bowls provide a rim from 14 to 15 inches high, “comfort height” is also available, which sits 17 to 19 inches above the floor, to make getting on and off easier.</span></p>
<h3>Choose Your Style</h3>
<p><b>Bowl Shape<br />
</b>Consider the bowl shape: A round bowl is classic. It also takes up less space than an elongated version, so it’s good for a small bath or water closet. However, the elongated bowl provides greater room to sit and thus tends to be more comfortable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you seek a contemporary style, look at toilets with a concealed or skirted trapway, to hides the contours of the base. Besides the sleek appearance, this version is easier to clean since there are fewer curves where dirt can collect.</span></p>
<h3>One-piece or two?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like a bathing suit, but there are practical as well as stylistic reasons. A one-piece toilet takes up less space, is faster to install, and easier to clean since there is no seam to trap grime. However, all other features being the same, a two-piece is cheaper, plus its tank can be removed if you need to replace it or repair a pipe, whereas damage to a one-piece can mean the entire toilet would have to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find wall models with the tank concealed in the wall which speeds maintenance since you don’t have to clean around the base. However, be aware that a wall-hung toilet requires breaking into the wall to hide the flushing mechanism which is an added cost to the budget. Also, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access for repair is more complicated since the tank is not exposed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38626 size-full" title="hexagon-tiles-on-bathroom-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="bathroom with rustic vanity and contemporary toilet and honeycomb or hexagon wall tiles and off white wall paint after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3>Fashion colors</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with appliances, you won’t find all styles in all colors, but you will find a nice range to choose from—including the hue of the moment, gray—if you want to go beyond white. A color will cost more, however, since whatever you choose won’t be manufactured in the same quantities as white or even black. And since white remains the most popular color for baths, you’ll enjoy plenty of options there, from cool to warm to ivory to bisque, to match your decor.</span></p>
<h3>Don’t Forget About Flush Performance</h3>
<p><b>Flushing mechanisms</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two choices: gravity feed and pressure-assisted: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the term indicates, gravity feed uses gravity to send water through the rim of the toilet to force waste through the outlet pipe.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure-assisted employs compressed air or a small pump. Gravity feed tends to be quieter, while pressure-assisted claims to require less water to operate along with greater effectiveness removing solid waste. You can find some pressure-assisted models that use electricity to boost function, but keep in mind if there is a power outage, the toilet won’t operate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Water conservation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two decades ago, the U.S. Department of Energy set a requirement for all newly manufactured toilets, restricting them to a maximum use of 1.6 gallons per flush. (Since then, the state of California has set a lower standard—1.28 gallons per flush.) Manufacturers met this requirement and, in fact, now some go as low as 0.9 gallons. As you shop, look for the WaterSense certification from the EPA, which indicates that the toilet uses no more than the standard 1.28 gallons.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr3uihyuiUo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40927 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-OrderMaterials-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<h3>Other Toilet Features to Consider</h3>
<p><b>Dual-flush options</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want worry-free performance from your toilet, but even with the EPA restrictions, you’re aware of the ongoing need to conserve water, right? With dual flush, just as the term indicates, two buttons offer either the option of a partial flush for liquid waste or a complete flush for solid.</span></p>
<p><b>Touchless flush</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Motion sensors are no longer just for faucets and towel dispensers in a public washroom. The same type of touchless technology can now activate the flushing of your toilet with just the wave of a hand. Super convenient and ideal for hygienic considerations.</span></p>
<p><b>Bidet or a combo?</b><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a bath doesn’t have room to add a bidet—which takes up at least the width of another toilet—manufacturers now offer a toilet/bidet combo in some of their models. This added feature translates to as much as 10x the cost of a standard toilet, but think of all the money you’ll save on toilet paper. Expect to find controls that offer different settings for water temperature, spray, and pressure, and also a drying mechanism.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40372 size-full" title="bidet toilet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg" alt="bidet toilet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A toilet with a bidet seat in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/wet-room-renovation-pleasantville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Alice’s Pleasantville, New York renovation</a></p>
<p><b>Self-cleaning bowl<br />
</b>While maintenance hasn’t been completely eliminated, some toilets come with ceramic glazes that include antimicrobial ions to reduce germs. You can also find models that integrate self-cleaning systems that do some of the scrubbing labor for you (and eliminate those messy toilet brushes!), with a combination of nozzles to reduce daily waste buildup, as well as a cleaning cycle, which is to say a system of sprays that— at the press of a button—interact with a cleaning solution emitted from a cartridge concealed in the tank.</p>
<p><b>And more little extras<br />
</b>It wasn’t so long ago that the news in toilets was the soft-close seat. Now you can have a toilet that opens the lid for you, too. Some turn the toilet into a miniature spa experience with more innovations, including soft LED lights for nighttime use, venting systems, and heated seats. If thes<span style="font-weight: 400;">e features don’t come with your new toilet, you can find kits at box stores to retrofit.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31125 mb-10 size-chrono" title="front door and entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-723x482.jpg" alt="front door" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Nazli and Larry&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First impressions make lasting impressions, and this is as true of your home as it is of anything else in life. Let’s begin with the front door. It’s the focal point of your entry and the feature upon which pretty much everything else hinges—literally. You can go dramatic or understated, but you want a door that works with the style of your house while also keeping it secure and free from drafts. The right choice will set you well on your way to the kind of curb appeal that also gives a boost to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-is-home-equity-and-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the value of your home</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s plenty to consider when selecting from front door styles. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers a rundown of front door styles—materials, colors, accessories, and add-ons—to help you navigate the process.</p>
<h3>When should you upgrade a front door?</h3>
<p>In short: security, energy efficiency, and good looks. The appropriate door performs on many levels. It’s also a good investment. The National Association of Realtors advises that homeowners can expect as much as an 80 percent return on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">window and door upgrades</a> at closing. If you’re not moving, this enhancement makes you a better neighbor and a happier homeowner with a prettier front entrance. Prices across front door styles can range from $200 up to $2,000+ if you add on sidelights, transoms, or different finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also seize the opportunity to upgrade security with a newer, more secure lock system. Additionally, you could also get an energy-efficient door that reduces air leakage and cuts your utility costs!</p>
<h3>Finding your front door style</h3>
<p>The choice is yours, and you can have whatever you want—windows or a solid panel, sidelights, or a transom. To maximize curb appeal, you should stick with a door that fits with the architecture of your home. Today’s houses, especially new construction, can often be a hybrid that includes features from different eras. For example, you&#8217;ll see Tudor plus French Revival, or Spanish Colonial plus Craftsman. Consult with a professional (an architect, your contractor, or a door company sales rep) who has experience pairing the right door with a particular house style. You can also research architectural home styles online, like on manufacturers’ websites, and compare what you find with your home. <a href="https://www.thermatru.com/inspiration/doorways-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therma-Tru Doors offers the DoorWays app</a>, which allows you to try out different doors on an image of your own front entrance.</p>

<h3>Front door systems and configurations</h3>
<p>You’ll find that entry doors are often referred to as “door systems.” This means they come pre-hung in a frame and pre-drilled for both doorknob and deadbolt, not just a mere rectangular slab. The system should also include the door’s bottom edge, which interlocks with the threshold. It will also likely have weather stripping encircling the door’s perimeter. This setup is convenient and sensible. This way, you purchase all the door features from one manufacturer to ensure everything functions well together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re replacing an existing door, you will want it to be the same size as the previous one, unless you are taking apart the entire entryway for a dramatic change. Changing the dimensions of the door (like adding sidelights or a transom) involves reframing the opening. For this type of involved job, you want to work with a general contractor. Before committing to a particular door, consult with your own contractor to ensure the door will fit. (Do this before it is paid for and delivered!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other terms you’ll encounter are “flush” and “paneled.” Flush doors are flat and smooth on both faces. Paneled doors have rectangular recesses framed by horizontal rails and vertical stiles. Originally, panel construction was meant to minimize cracking and warping on wood doors. They do this by giving the panels room to shift with changes in humidity. The “look” caught on, and it can now be found in other door materials. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Front door material choices</h3>
<p>When you see the word “door,” you may automatically think “wood.” However, there’s more to materials nowadays, including fiberglass, steel, and wood composites. In each of these categories, doors are typically made of more than one material. Other materials are incorporated to enhance stability and energy efficiency. A wood door may have a steel interior, a steel door may have a wood exterior, a fiberglass door may have a wood frame—all for stability and strength—and most will have some type of foam insulation to fill the interior voids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the materials has its pros and cons, and the versatility to achieve different styles, configurations, and finishes, including the look of woodgrain.</p>
<h4>Fiberglass front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fiberglass doors are a practical choice for most climates, particularly harsh or humid weather. They resist wear and tear extremely well. Available in smooth or embossed woodgrain texture, they can mimic the look of wood and take paint or stain. These doors are dent-resistant, require little maintenance, and typically come with a long warranty, from 20 years to a limited lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Can crack under severe impact.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $1,500</p>
<h4>Steel front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Steel doors are positioned as the strongest of doors. They will not crack or warp. Coated with a baked-on polyester finish, steel doors will require periodic repainting. Higher-end versions come with a vinyl finish for greater weather resistance. Some manufacturers offer a wood veneer or wood composite coating that can be stained.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Not as weather-resistant as fiberglass or wood doors. They are easy to dent, and dings are hard to fix. Scratches on steel doors may rust if not treated promptly. In extremely high temperatures, the surface can be hot to the touch.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Both steel and fiberglass doors should come with a thermal break that separates the inside and outside door skins. This prevents the transfer of outdoor heat and cold, which can cause frost to form on the inside surface.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $2,000</p>
<h4>Wood front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fans of wood front doors are drawn to its heritage of warmth and the versatility of different species. Wood resists cold and heat. Some wood doors are composed of veneer skin over an engineered wood core. This protects the core from moisture that causes shrinking, swelling, and warping. It’s also the least likely material to dent, and scratches are easy to repair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Solid doors can be made through a millwork shop, lumberyard, and some door manufacturers, but they are expensive and time-consuming to complete. They also require regular upkeep—painting or varnishing to maintain their appearance—and a protected area in the shade or under an overhang.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $175 &#8211; $2,600</p>
<h3>Decorative details for front doors</h3>
<p>The hardware—hinges, door handle—are practical, while also complementing your door style. Manufacturers will offer further options for customization with decorative glass, grilles, metal trim, and clavos (AKA, decorative door studs). Sidelights and/or a transom also lend visual interest while letting in more light. There’s plenty of choice within the glass category, too—clear, rain, satin, and geometric to name a few. And don’t forget the door knocker, even if you have a doorbell!</p>
<h3>Front door styles: Colors to consider</h3>
<p>A contrasting or complementary door color adds a touch of wit and drama to the entry. Try matching it to the window frames or shutters, if you have them, for a truly coordinated look. Or just go for it with one bold color for the door. Many manufacturers offer color as part of the door selection process, which saves you the trouble of painting. These finishes are formulated to be fade-resistant, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Picking the right front door can feel like a big commitment, and it is. But as with all the right relationships, it’s one that you can depend on and enjoy for many years.</p>
<p>—</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh a kitchen in Jersey City, NJ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Kate and Matt loved their Jersey City neighborhood with the park across the street from their 1870s building. Nevertheless, after seven years of marriage, they knew what did and didn’t work in their kitchen floor plan, and decided it was high time for a makeover. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age, and storage was bursting at the seams, creating a chaotic pileup on every surface. While the kitchen is indisputably the heart of the home, when it literally falls in the middle of a living space (often referred to as railroad-style), it takes some serious planning to make the space fully functional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cook space was serviceable but worn. Kate had lived in the condo since 2000 and was more than weary of the laminate-clad cabinets and counters and the 30-year-old appliances. The kitchen’s location, in the middle of the apartment, dictated the galley setup. A massive soffit further encroached on the wall space, limiting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30957 size-chrono" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30956 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-brown-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with brown flooring before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Kate’s primary objective, besides a completely new look, was the addition of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-peninsula-ideas-for-small-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakfast bar</a>. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30959 mb-0 size-chrono" title="glossy-wooden-flooring-passageway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-723x1085.jpg" alt="glossy wooden flooring in passageway with white railing and gray custom shelves after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate knew she wanted gray cabinets but worried the kitchen, which had no windows, might still be dark. So she countered with lighter materials for all the other surfaces—white quartz countertops, a white subway tile backsplash, and a pale wood breakfast bar. Her budget didn’t include money for new light fixtures, so she found brighter LED bulbs for the recessed ceiling lights. “That made a big difference.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her contractor saw an opportunity to move the refrigerator a few feet over from its original corner location, to allow storage on either side, while breaking up the monotony of a long run of cabinets. In addition, he moved the placement of the new dishwasher (an 18-inch version that Kate scored from Craigslist) from the left of the sink to the right, permitting roomier, deeper drawers to the right of the range, where they were needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30966 size-chrono" title="building-custom-cabinets-during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01-723x1085.jpg" alt="building the custom wooden cabinets in kitchen during renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30962 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-custom-kitchen-cabinets-open-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-723x482.jpg" alt="gray custom kitchen cabinets with open shelves and white countertop with sink after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Kate’s breakfast bar, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a> proved less of an obstacle than she thought. After discussing several scenarios, she and her Sweeten contractor settled on a location at the far end of the kitchen, above the stairs. Matt and Kate wondered about things falling off the ledge to the floor below, particularly from the swipe of a paw from their tabby, George. A raised back to the bar was added at her contractor’s recommendation to inhibit the antics of a capricious cat. He also inserted a diagonal base cabinet between the range and the cabinet abutting the breakfast bar. “I worried I’d be constantly bumping into sharp corners,” said Kate, “but the diagonal unit made everything flow together.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30968 size-chrono" title="white-countertop-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-723x1085.jpg" alt="white countertop and kitchen cabinets with brown vinyl floor during renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-During03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30964 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-custom-cabinets-open-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-723x1085.jpg" alt="blue custom cabinets on wall with open shelves and white countertop with steel sink and faucet and glossy wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another concern was whether her budget was enough for everything she wanted. Her contractor advised her on which materials to choose so she wouldn&#8217;t overspend. Now, with plenty of cabinets to store cooking gear, and loads of counter space, there’s a place for everything and everyone, including George, who also likes to sit at the breakfast bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: When the time came to gut the kitchen, her Sweeten general contractor made a marvelous discovery. The soffits, which consumed so much upper wall space, were empty. This meant they could be removed, and taller upper cabinets installed, greatly increasing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage capacity</a>. “It just opened up the room,” said Kate. “It feels more spacious and brighter at the same time.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Cabinets: Custom. Cabinet hardware: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>. Refrigerator: <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Serving as either an open gathering place or a cozy retreat, the deck has become a popular alternative to the patio and porch. Outdoor deck materials have improved in durability and beauty, with a range of types to choose from. Rather than choosing based on looks alone, it&#8217;s useful to know the pros and cons of the most common material options available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of the deck&#8217;s foundation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how you design it or outfit it with planters and pergolas, at its essence the deck is a large outdoor platform. Typically, it is connected to the house, and raised from the ground anywhere from a few inches to several feet. This is in contrast to a patio, which is made of stone or concrete and set into the earth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though made from moisture-resistant or repellent material, decks should be isolated from the ground by supports set into concrete footers. Contact with soil will eventually rot any kind of wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decking boards come in specially milled or manufactured sizes that are typically 2-by-4s, though widths can vary from a given manufacturer to provide you with more design options. Look for rounded edges that resist splintering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find many choices for joining systems. Some systems conceal screw heads, for a cleaner appearance and and to keep water from seeping into screw holes. Other systems are designed to allow expansion and contraction of the boards. “Decking boards with slotted sides can be installed using a clip system, so you do not have to surface fasten the boards,” says Doug L. Mucher, Senior Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/decking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>. “This provides a cleaner installation.”</p>

<h3>Zoning and local codes for outdoor decks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure your deck is in compliance, deck supports are best installed by an experienced contractor who knows the local codes and zoning laws. Some cities or counties require approval from the planning commission and inspections during the building process. Keep in mind: these rules might limit your grand plans, or require some creative adaptations. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your contractor before proceeding with the build. “Most homeowners can handle replacing the deck surface,” says Mucher. “However, if the project requires the deck substructure to be built as well, you’ll most likely want to hire a contractor. A contractor can be required to make sure it is built to code.”</p>
<h3>How to choose outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Your choice of outdoor deck materials will be driven by your lifestyle, taste, and local climate. Does your area get a lot of rain and humidity? Heat and sun? Most modern deck materials can withstand any climate, but some require more upkeep than others to stay in good shape and appearance, especially in harsher climates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Different types of outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Wood continues to be a popular choice. If you like classic materials, you can choose from a range of softwoods and hardwoods. You&#8217;ll get good-to-great performance, as long as you follow a regular maintenance routine. There are some synthetic alternatives, too. Consider the following:</p>
<h4>Pressure-treated pine hardwood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: This is an inexpensive softwood that&#8217;s been impregnated with chemical preservatives, making it more resistant to insects and to splitting, swelling, and rot from humidity than other woods. It&#8217;s easy to paint. It&#8217;s also strong, and well-suited to the structural parts of the deck, even if you choose different woods for the deck surface and other visible elements. Pressure-treated pine is the thriftiest option, so it&#8217;s good for homeowners on a strict budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: It is a natural material and requires frequent maintenance to assure top performance. Pressure-treated pine is not as attractive as some other popular wood options, including cedar or redwood. As with all real wood, it can splinter. Upkeep includes deep cleaning and application of a lumber preservative annually as well as occasional sanding. The chemicals used in the pressure treatment are toxic. This isn&#8217;t typically a problem in an outdoor setting, but some homeowners prefer to keep this treated wood in places like the deck&#8217;s support structure, where they won&#8217;t have to come in direct contact with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $1.50 per square foot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Non-treated wood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: There’s a reason why many synthetic decking materials simulate the look of wood. There is nothing like this natural material for its warmth and expression of quality. The most popular softwood species are cedar and redwood, for their good looks and natural moisture resistance. Natural tannins and oils resist insects well, and these woods are easy to stain, paint, and seal. Some decks are built with tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, which are incredibly resilient, and in some cases are accepted by fire codes that otherwise require concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Even hardwoods are not as long-lasting as plastics. Wood can dent, split, splinter, fade, and require frequent upkeep to maintain the best appearance and life. You will need to not only wash with a wood cleaner or pressure-washer, but also seal it at least once annually. Best to sweep daily or weekly to avoid damage from gritty dirt. Darker shades will heat up in sunlight, making them unpleasant underfoot in the summer when you are likely to spend the most time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot for cedar; from $6 per square foot for redwood, $8 per square foot for ipe.</p>
<h4>Composite</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: Made from wood fibers bound by a resin, synthetic decking is nearly maintenance-free. It will not warp, splinter, or rot, and it repels insects. It requires no stain or sealing and offers a wide selection of simulated wood looks and colors. It also can be molded and so lends itself to curved shapes. It requires little care except cleaning with soapy water and a soft-bristle brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Surfaces in darker colors can become hot in the sun and may fade over time. It can melt if exposed to high heat, such as from a grill. Scratches can’t be buffed out, and dropped greasy foods might leave stains. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $5 per square foot.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a thermoplastic that can be shaped and formed into a variety of products including decking. A particularly hard plastic, it won’t scratch, warp, rot, split, or stain; it’s lightweight and easy to install and requires no annual treatments other than cleaning with soap and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: More limited palette than composite. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vinyl</h4>
<p>PRO: Lightweight vinyl is comprised of PVC and polyethylene. Available in faux-wood styles and textures, this material is easy to install thanks to its light weight and ease of slicing with a saw. It never needs painting, resists staining and fading, and won’t heat up, unlike natural wood and some composites. Easy to clean with soap and water.</p>
<p>CON: Over time, it may sag. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $3 per square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30735 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck with pergola" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola-723x482.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to personalize your outdoor deck</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve narrowed down your choice of material, you can think about ways to customize the deck. “With all the styles and colors available, homeowners are really only limited by their imagination,” says Mucher.</p>
<h4>Outdoor deck design ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix different colors or shades of planks</li>
<li>Combine different plank widths</li>
<li>Run planks in different directions to create a pattern, like a herringbone or a fan</li>
<li>Add a contrasting border</li>
<li>Paint on a stenciled motif</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30738 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1-723x736.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="736" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> <span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Deck by CertainTeed</span></span></p>
<h4>Make the deck resemble an actual room:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create steps and two or more levels for different activities, such as relaxing, dining, taking in the view</li>
<li>Install an outdoor kitchen, chiminea (freestanding, front-loading fireplace or oven), or spa</li>
<li>Incorporate a pergola or a lanai</li>
<li>Include lighting, for use at night or to highlight an area</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, most decks, particularly those that are raised or tiered, include a railing. You can match your deck material or choose a complementary style or finish. Work with your contractor to make sure all the necessary elements are incorporated, for safety and security as well as environment and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Invest time in planning and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selecting a vetted general contractor</a> to guide you through the process. You want your deck to be dependable and a space you enjoy sharing with family and guests.</p>

<h3>Ceramic glass <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/wolf/cooktops-and-rangetops/induction-cooktops/30-inch-contemporary-induction-cooktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a> from Wolf</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you like to cook? Do you like to prepare gourmet meals? Do you entertain frequently? Are you in a hurry to get dinner on the table? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, you might want to check out one of the hottest “new” entries into home cooking today: the induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this type of cooking was first introduced to the U.S. about 70 years ago, it is enjoying a surge in popularity, thanks to a couple of factors. A growing demand for this appliance has lowered prices. You can find some models for under $1,000, or as much as a third of what they once cost. The smooth cooking surface answers the demands of another trend: a sleek, uncluttered kitchen. Finally, the precision and speed of induction cooking draws Americans who are increasingly strapped for time at home and welcome the opportunity to cut even minutes from meal prep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, unpacks the many features of induction to help you better understand what’s available and noteworthy.</p>
<h3>What is induction?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction is a method of producing heat for cooking. It works by creating an interaction between a metal pot or pan and an electromagnetic field below the tempered glass surface of the cooktop to heat the cookware. Induction is the only method that directly uses the cookware as a part of the cooking system.</p>
<h3>How does induction work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beneath the surface—ceramic or tempered glass—of an induction cooktop rests an induction coil. When the coil is activated (by turning on its control knob or pad), an electrical current passes through this coil, creating an electromagnetic field of energy. Upon contact with that field, the iron molecules in the pan begin to vibrate. It is the friction between those molecules that heats the cookware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooktop surface itself does not emit heat. Rather, heat is produced only when it is turned on and a pan makes contact with the cooktop surface. Once the pan is removed from the cooktop, the magnetic connection is broken and heat is no longer generated. Before the pan makes contact, the cooktop surface, even when it’s been turned on, will remain cool. After the pan is removed from the cooktop, the surface will be warm, but not hot to the touch.</p>
<h3>How does induction differ from other heating sources?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike gas or radiant <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooktops</a>, there is no exposed flame or coil. If you turn on an induction cooktop, it generates no heat until the appropriate cookware is placed in contact with it. Also, the heat is contained within the circumference of the pan or cooktop. As a result, less energy is generated and wasted because the heat is created only within the pan, and not in the surrounding environment.</p>
<h3>Are there distinct benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, all cooktops are not alike. While any heat source will cook food, and cook it well, induction does have standout features that include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Safety</b></span> &#8211; The heat happens in the pan, so there’s no danger of accidentally touching a hot cooktop. This is a particular benefit to homes with children or elderly family members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Accuracy</b></span> &#8211; Precision control at very low or high heat lets the cooktop maintain a temperature to melt chocolate, simmer a cream sauce, or boil pasta water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Speed</b></span> &#8211; The electromagnetic field below the glass cooktop surface quickly generates heat directly to the pan, so water boils faster—manufacturers claim a quart of water boils in less than two minutes—than with gas or radiant heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Energy efficiency</b></span> &#8211; Heat occurs only within the pan where it makes contact with the cooktop, so there’s no energy wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Easy cleaning</b></span> &#8211; A smooth, continuous surface means no crannies where food can catch, and because most of the cooktop stays cool when you’re cooking, spills don’t burn on.</p>
<h3>What else is noteworthy?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique cooking function—that electromagnetic field—lends itself to lots of interesting options. For instance, most manufacturers make cooktops with multiple cooking zones that can be bridged to create larger zones for, say, a roasting pan or a Dutch oven. Gaggenau’s induction cooktop makes possible the free positioning of cookware within its combined cooking areas. Thermador offers a memory feature that transfers power settings to another cooking area when the pot is relocated. BlueStar, in addition to a warming burner at 150 degrees, has a Power Boost feature—a 5,500-watt burner that claims to bring one gallon of water in a large pot to a rolling boil in only three and half minutes. Previously, induction wasn’t so good for wok cooking because the coil element couldn’t make contact with enough of the wok’s raised surface. Jenn-Air makes an induction wok module for just that purpose.</p>
<h3>What about installation or replacement?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooktops are made to the same dimensions as comparable gas or radiant cooktops—24, 30, 36, and 48 inches. So you can replace your existing cooktop with an induction version of the same dimensions as long as you have an electrical hookup of the same voltage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to install an induction cooktop over a wall oven, it’s best done with both appliances from the same manufacturer. However, you will want to consult with your contractor and review the installation instructions to make sure they are compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most manufacturers that make induction cooktops will also offer ranges with the induction cooktop option.</p>
<h3>Is special cookware required?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooking requires ferromagnetic cookware or pots and pans with an iron core, which allows the transfer of energy to the pan. Your cast iron pieces and most stainless steel should work fine. Hold a magnet to the bottom of the pan; if it sticks, it will work. Glass and other non-metallic items will not, however, since they lack the iron core and will need to be replaced if you opt-in for this type of cooktop.</p>
<h3>How about care and maintenance?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the unused areas of an induction cooktop remain cool while you are cooking, most spills and splatters will not cook onto the surface. The exception can be foods with sugar content, such as sauces or sweet potatoes. It’s sensible to wipe up any spills quickly with a sponge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The smooth, continuous surface makes it easy to maintain and keep it looking new—far easier than a gas model with its contours and grates, or radiant, unless it is topped with tempered glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only use a cleaner made for your cooktop. A regular glass cleaner with ammonia will mar the surface. Also, always lift a pot when you transfer it; never slide cookware, as this can scratch the cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these features add up to lots of choice for the home cook. With so much selection and specialization, where do you begin? When shopping for induction, ask for demonstrations. Many showrooms offer cooking classes so you can try your hand at induction cooking. After all, who doesn’t want a little romance before making a commitment?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Update a galley kitchen in Westchester County, NY</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Two decades after moving into her 1912 co-op in the town of Eastchester, Nancy felt her galley kitchen was due for a dramatic overhaul. What she craved was a brighter, more contemporary-looking kitchen. True, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley layout</a> was functional, with plenty of room for generous-sized appliances and two vast expanses of prep space. Yet, it was precisely those long stretches of surfaces that caused the room to feel outdated. The speckled laminate countertop clashed with the original wood cabinets, while the wood floor was an awkward marriage of half oak and half pine—both with time-worn stain finishes. Anxious to get an improvement underway, she posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and chose her Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30442 mb-0 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Having used the kitchen for 20 years, Nancy remained satisfied with the original cabinets and the placement of appliances. She began the renovation with the selection of a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertop</a> and floor that would reflect her vision of a calm, minimalist cook space. She knew she wanted Caesarstone for its durability and easy maintenance, and fell in love with a pale gray that harmonized with the stainless steel appliances that she had installed a few years earlier. Underfoot, “I always wanted a black floor,” she says. Crisp black ceramic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> answered her wish. The small hexagonal tile shape adds a subtle pattern while the extensive grout lines help keep the surface nonslip. New black knobs, found on Amazon for the cabinets, visually connect the pale wood with the tile and lend a touch of drama.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30443 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen01-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30444 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the backsplash, Nancy opted for a white ceramic subway tile, keeping with the original era of the kitchen and its cabinets. A new undermount stainless steel sink and sculptural single-lever faucet with matching soap dispenser tie in with the existing appliances to underscore the sleek, simple look she was after. A coat of paint for the walls and radiator and new toe kicks under the cabinets complete the surface transformation. The result: A kitchen with a fresh outlook that’s still at home in its surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30445 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NancyFieldman_Kitchen04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Keeping the cabinets and appliances in place allowed Nancy to invest in the materials—countertop, floor tile—that she had her heart set on. The rip-and-replace renovation also meant minimal disruption, and the contractor finished the job exactly when he said he would.</p>

<p><span class="img-label"><em>Nancy and Aram&#8217;s </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>bathroom renovation</em></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower has, at last, stepped up next to the tub—separate and equal—to become a focal point in the bath. However, there’s more to a fabulous shower experience than a multi-spray <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/shower-heads-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> and pretty tiled walls. You will also want to consider the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower door</a>, which sets the tone for the shower’s overall appearance and harmony with your bath’s décor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spa-like and almost invisible? Check. Framed and architecturally attention-worthy? Check. As you research and shop, you’ll find a shower door to suit every bathing enclosure and décor. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveys the factors involved in selecting a shower door to better inform you as you research this important feature.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Getting started</h3>
<p>You may decide to place the shower next to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub</a> because it looks nice, or because you don’t want to make major changes to the water lines. Perhaps you only need a shower in a space with limited square footage, so you want to put it in the corner. Wherever the shower ends up, your design will require one of the following door mounting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Framed shower doors</li>
<li>Semi-frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Frameless shower doors</li>
<li>Freestanding shower doors</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style you choose can be based mostly on your taste. However, before committing, you will want to consult with your contractor to assess the bathroom space for quirks. After all, not all bathrooms are made alike: dimensions vary from ceiling to floor, plumbing lines wander, walls and floors are not always plumb. Your contractor can help you determine the best location for the shower, including making sure that the walls can bear the weight of frameless shower doors.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25237 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="frameless glass shower doors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><em><span class="img-label">Mary Ann and Frank&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation</a></span></em></p>
<h3>Styles for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>The door you select will depend not only on your preferences as to the style and movement of the door but also any space restrictions. Is there room for the door to swing open? Or can the width handle sliding doors? Placement of controls on one or two walls and the width and height of the shower enclosure will also factor in. Consider the following options:</p>
<h4>Sliding shower doors</h4>
<p>Two panels fit in a frame and slide in either direction to open and close.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg" alt="Moroccan tile floor" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-48734" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><em>A sliding glass shower door in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicole &amp; Missy&#8217;s Arlington, VA bathroom</a></em></p>
<h4>Swing or pivot shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane attached to a wall swings open from the left or right.</p>
<h4>Door and panel</h4>
<p>One narrow pane is fixed to the wall while next to it, a panel is fixed with hinges to the other wall and operates as the door.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-600x900.jpg" alt="garage shower" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-46481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-24.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><em>A door-and-panel style shower door in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaime Ray Newman&#8217;s bathroom</a></em></p>
<h4>Butterfly or bi-fold doors</h4>
<p>Two equal-size panels are hinged at the center to open inward.</p>
<h4>Fixed shower doors</h4>
<p>A single pane of glass attached to the wall holding the showerhead protects the bathroom from splashes; the rest of the shower opening remains uncovered.</p>
<h3>Shower door mounting options</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, framed was the only way to go. (Remember those shower doors when you were growing up?) With the widespread popularity of open design, semi-frameless shower doors and frameless showers have caught homeowners&#8217; attention. Improvements in mounting systems, including thicker glass supported by sleeker, stronger hinges, means you can have a shower that seems to float or even disappear. Your choices come down to four solutions:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Framed shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This product features a metal frame around all four edges of the operating doors. In addition, metal channels framing the shower opening allow for hinges that attach swinging doors or the gliding motion of sliding doors. Framed glass doors are created to fit standard shower openings. The appearance doesn’t have to be standard, though. Manufacturers offer a range of looks, from super contemporary clean-lined chrome to matte black in a windowpane pattern from Coastal Shower Doors that will conjure your own private Downton Abbey. Duravit makes a glass enclosure with two self-locking doors that fold against either wall when not in use, so the shower disappears entirely.</p>
<p>Special details notwithstanding, framed doors can be the thriftiest way to go and the easiest to install. The glass panes are typically 1/4-inch thick</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semi-frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Semi-frameless shower doors may include framing around the entire shower opening, but not around the actual door panels. It also typically features 1/4-inch glass. Semi-frameless doors lend themselves to some creative trends in headers, like exposed industrial-style hardware with rollers and bars that suggest barn door hardware.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frameless shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not completely without hardware, frameless is still the way to go if you want an open, seamless, truly spa-like effect for your shower. Advances in hardware engineering and glass manufacturing make this type of installation appear to float. Glass panels attach to hinges that then attach to walls. There is commonly a combo of a fixed panel and a swinging door, both made of 5/8-inch safety glass. Besides the hinges, the only hardware is the door handle and possibly a towel bar, though after going to all this trouble, why would you want anything to block the view?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freestanding shower doors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the very high end, you will find freestanding shower enclosures. They consist of a shower pan with a four-sided metal framework in which glass panels fit, one of them a door. Drummonds, an English manufacturer, makes several models for the United States market. If you can afford the hefty price tag, you can have this shower up and working in a couple of hours.</p>
<h3>Finishes for glass shower doors</h3>
<p>Finally, you will choose a finish for the frame and its accompanying pieces—hinges and hardware. A good rule of thumb is to choose the finish that matches your shower head and any other shower fittings, like a hand shower or jets. Of course, the choice is up to you, and here, too, is a range—brushed, nickel, oil-rubbed bronze, and ever-popular chrome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All edges of your shower door should arrive finished or polished. Styles for the appearance of the flat surface include:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Opaque shower door</b><b>s</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A holdover from the previous century, opaque shower doors are good for those seeking privacy. Ask to see a manufacturer’s offerings in this category, which can range from pebbled to brushed to the appearance of raindrops.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Clear glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These remain a strong trend in bathrooms. Rightly so: they promote the open appearance in a bath while showing off sleek shower fittings and surface treatments of tile or stone.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tinted glass shower doors</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are created during the manufacturing process and come in subtle, natural tones like gray, bronze, and blue. As a bonus, they complement America&#8217;s favorite bathroom color—white—as well as stone, tile, and metals for faucets and showerheads, and controls.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Etched glass</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Etched glass shower doors permit privacy with opaque designs etched onto clear glass. Patterns available can be figurative, like images from nature, or abstract. Custom designs will cost you more and must be specially ordered. The etching is on the outside face of the shower.</p>
<h3>Glass shower doors: Thickness &amp; durability</h3>
<p>The less framework for the door, the thicker the glass. Standard glass shower doors come 1/2- or 3/8-inch thick; frameless doors should be 5/8-inch thick. All must be made of safety glass, which shatters into small pieces when broken, not into lethal shards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The shower door—a seemingly small yet often overlooked feature—makes a huge impact on the look and feel of your bathroom. As you make your decision, think about how you shower, and what’s important to you as you experience your daily bathroom rituals. You want the shower to feel like it’s part of the of the bathroom. The right glass shower door can do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>If you thought this appliance was indispensable now, features like self-cleaning, an integrated sink, and a mini washer will wash your socks right off</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22857 size-chrono" title="washing machine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_DavisonKitchen-06_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="506" /></a>(Above) A washing machine tucked under the counter in Davison and Bernice&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing laundry is unavoidable, but happily, washing machines are doing more of the heavy lifting for you. Digital controls, cycles tailored for everything from delicates to lycra to bath towels, vibration reduction, and childproof locks make wash day safer and less of a chore. While innovation breakthroughs have not gone so far as to make washing machines touchless, like some other appliances, there are more than a few new features that further reduce the time spent while increasing efficiency. Here’s a rundown:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The pros of front-loading</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The washing machine with the door that opens from the front, as opposed to the top, is not brand new; Europeans have enjoyed this feature for decades. However, it is becoming more widely available from manufacturers. The advantages: Front-loading machines require less water, can take more clothes, and tend to clean more gently and thoroughly than their top-loading counterparts. Top-loaders wash with the help of an agitator. Versions without the agitator are high-efficiency (HE) washers. Like front-loaders, they use less water, have larger capacities, require more time to wash, and spin faster, too, wringing out more water to save drying time later. They also cost more than the agitator version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic dispensers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This receptacle releases detergent, bleach, and fabric softener, each at the appropriate time, so you don’t have to hang around waiting for just the right moment. Every minute saved is a minute you get back to do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Self-cleaning and low maintenance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water will collect in the machine, particularly front-loading models, without evaporating if you wash frequently, creating a risk of mildew and bacteria. New technology now keeps washers fresh, without introducing chemicals, through a combination of soaking, pulsating, and high-speed spinning. And you thought self-clean was just for ovens!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 size-chrono" title="two-in-one washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Tim and Lindsay&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-in-one washer and dryer</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load capacity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Capacities for front- and top-loading machines can range from about 3.8 cubic feet up to 6 cubic feet. Your habits for doing laundry—weekly loads of towels or sports clothes versus say, small loads separated by color—will guide your decision. Larger capacity machines help cut down the number of washes you run. Expect to pay more for these models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Steam wash</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Released from inside the washer, steam helps remove stains without pretreatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Secondary access door</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a top loader and you stumble upon that missing dirty sock, no problem. But what if your machine is a front loader? Now you’re in luck: Last year saw the introduction of a front-loading model with a secondary access door that lets you add small items mid-wash from Samsung.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono" title="washer and dryer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg" alt="washing machine" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front-loading washer and dryer</a> in Cristiana&#8217;s laundry room located in the basement of her home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integrated sink</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’ve ever soaked clothing with a pesky stain, you’ve probably had the experience of rushing with the drippy item from the sink to the washing machine, then going back to wipe up soapy water on the floor. No more. Samsung makes a top-loading machine with a hinged sink on top of the wash drum. A water jet aids the soaking or scrubbing; when the item is ready for the wash, lift the sink to drop the clothing through a slot at the back and into the machine, then begin the cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-in-one machine</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you like to wash small loads of a particular color, or can’t wait to launder those sweaty gym clothes; the two-in-one machine is for you. In addition to a central or primary drum, there’s another smaller drum at the base or top of the machine. You can run both washers simultaneously or independently, as needed. LG also offers a compact washer that can be retro-fitted to an existing machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Black stainless steel finish</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Less industrial looking than its silvery-colored older sibling, black stainless steel makes a stylish statement in the laundry room, joining the ranks of ever-classic white, and some colors, too, which you may find on the market for a few seasons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">The lowdown on wood flooring options—solid, engineered, reclaimed—and how to choose</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20504 size-chrono" title="hardwood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="sweeten_rima_hardwood_flooring-10" width="723" height="482" /></a>(Above) Rima installed mid-sized <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plank engineered wood</a> with a matte finish throughout her home.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Of all the surface options available for the home, hardwood flooring remains the one with the most cachet and value. After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you’re likely to find an option that suits your home’s style as well as your lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who’s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment—of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider your lifestyle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Will there be pets scratching it with their nails? </span><span class="s1">High heels from frequent entertaining? </span><span class="s1">Toys from energetic little ones?</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? </span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Today’s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono" title="engineered wood flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/mid-century-mad-men-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered wood</a> replaced old parquet floors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Customize the look</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means fewer seams into the overall floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board’s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />(Above) Dark walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Get real with solid hardwood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solid hardwood</a> comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home’s climate)</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Dust from sanding</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Chemical fumes from the finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish</span></li>
<li class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Length of time to final use of room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can’t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can’t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono" title="engineered wood floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="hardwood flooring" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineered wood</a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick in Miguel&#8217;s bedroom.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Fool the eye with engineered wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If it looks like it’s real wood, that’s because it is—a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You’ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood—as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don’t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can’t be reproduced today, even from advanced manufacturing techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it’s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider maintenance and repair </b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A primer on cooking with steam and convection ovens</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28737 mb-10 size-chrono" title="steam convection oven" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-723x546.jpg" alt="steam convection oven" width="723" height="546" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-723x546.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-300x227.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven-600x453.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-08-Oven.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<span class="img-label"> A Bosch steam convection oven in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick&#8217;s kitchen</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you love to cook you’ve probably heard about steam cooking. This method has graduated from the vegetable steamer of the ‘70s to more sophisticated options that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freestanding steam oven, which cooks solely with steam</li>
<li>The combination steam oven, which combines several functions: steam alone, convection and steam, or convection alone</li>
<li>The electric oven, which includes an added moisture function that injects bursts of steam into the heated oven cavity</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freestanding steam ovens take up about as much counter space as a high-end microwave, and they cost about the same—in the $300 range. This makes sense if you want to use steam cooking but don’t wish to replace your existing oven yet. However, if you regularly cook complete meals, a built-in combination steam and convection oven could make more sense. This version is available from all the major manufacturers, such as Thermador, Miele, Wolf, and Gaggenau, but expect to pay more than a conventional oven—as much as $3,000 to $8,000. The payoff? Manufacturers promise more bang for these bucks in faster, healthier results for all types of foods, along with nifty additional features, including proofing for bread, automatic boiling point detection, more than a dozen cooking modes, recipe retention, a self-cleaning function, and text display in dozens of languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, surveys the features and attributes of steam cooking.</p>
<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While steam cooking may not be right for every type of meal you prepare, it does offer many advantages consistent with the lifestyles and eating preferences of many home chefs today. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster cooking</li>
<li>Healthier results</li>
<li>Reheating or refreshing food</li>
<li>Holding cooked food for several hours</li>
<li>Thawing frozen food</li>
<li>Cooking several dishes simultaneously</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Common sense tells you that food cooked in steam retains moisture better than food cooked in dry heat. This translates into a reduced need for oil or added fats to prevent food from drying out. It also vastly reduces the evaporation of vitamins and minerals. Moisture is also a more effective heat conductor than dry, hot air, so steam ovens, especially when combined with convection, will cook food in less time—as much as a third or a half—than a conventional oven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a steam oven, manufacturers say that several dishes can be cooked together with no flavor transfer or temperature adjustment needed, shortening overall prep and cooking time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The humid environment also does a better job of reheating or refreshing a dish that’s been held over. Since there isn’t a risk of the food drying out, it won’t lose its original texture. Steam cooking cannot brown foods so you may need to switch from steam to convection to finish a dish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures will run from 120° to over 400° F to handle everything from a delicate fish to a tray of potatoes to a substantial roast. To get a crispy finish for fowl or fish, transfer items to a stovetop pan to sear before serving. Some of these cooking methods require more steps, so a combo steam and convection oven isn&#8217;t for the novice cook. When shopping, ask the salesperson about cooking demos for steam ovens. Many showrooms offer free classes both prior to purchase and after.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Steam ovens create steam from one of two sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reservoir that must be filled with water prior to use</li>
<li>A plumbed line (like water fed to your icemaker in the fridge)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heat from the oven turns the water into steam. The oven controls regulate the temperature in the cavity and the humidity. These sophisticated ovens come with preprogrammed modes that determine the correct setting for any type of food you plan to cook, from vegetables to meats to baked goods, rice, and soup.</p>
<h3>What about convection?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, if you added a new oven to your kitchen in the last five to 10 years, it has a convection function. Because convection uses a fan to circulate air through the oven cavity, it&#8217;s good at keeping the temperature steady and uniform. The circulating air also serves to cook the food more evenly, and sometimes more quickly, since heat is not concentrated from a single location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a combination steam and convection oven, the fan moves the moist, heated air throughout the cavity. It also allows you to switch to convection alone. This option is handy for some foods such as quick breads or pies to get a nice, brown finish. Consult the user’s manual when baking for the first time.</p>
<h3>Is it easy to clean?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After use, most steam ovens must be wiped down to remove all the moisture in the cavity. Neglect this task and you invite the possibility of mold as well as scales from minerals in the water. You will also need to remove the reservoir to let it dry completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage is that the steam prevents most splatters from cooking that would end up on the oven walls. Some manufacturers, such as Gaggenau, include a fully automatic cleaning system for their ovens that operate with the push of a button.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steam cooking is without a doubt the latest trend in food prep. However, with its many benefits—healthier meals, shortened cooking times, and tasty results—it’s a trend that should stick around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you hear the word “home,” a vision of family and friends gathered around a fireplace invariably pops up. It is, perhaps besides the kitchen table, the most iconic image of this favorite sanctuary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you crave the warmth and comfort of a fireplace for your house but currently are without one, take heart. If you are not ready to knock down a wall and install a chimney, here&#8217;s a solution: the ventless fireplace. Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, gives an overview of the different types to prepare you for working with your contractor to find the best solution.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why go ventless?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ventless options are a popular way to go in spaces that presently have no fireplace because they are easy to install over or inside an existing wall, or stand-alone. You can forgo the major construction and have a fireplace in a day, in most instances. If yours is a new house, it’s a matter of deciding where you want the unit to go, which is just about anywhere there’s room for the box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides location, consider operation. Because they need no wood to burn and there is no smoke to move out, ventless fireplaces don’t require the time-consuming building and tending of a fire, not to mention the continuous placement of wood, the removal of its sooty remains, and regular cleaning of the chimney flue. Another benefit: All the heat that is generated stays in the house. A traditional fireplace, while beautiful, sends most of its heat up and out the chimney.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can convert an existing fireplace with a chimney to a ventless fireplace by means of a fireplace insert. An insert is a fireproof box surrounded by steel or cast iron and fronted by insulated glass or a metal screen. The steel or cast iron helps to trap the heat and protect surrounding surfaces. Some inserts include a blower to push hot air back into the room through front vents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before settling on the type you want, take a thoughtful look at the space in which you want to introduce the fireplace. Consider, too, who will use it and how often. Talk to your contractor before making a decision, as he or she can advise as to what is safely possible to alter or add. While ventless fireplaces are simple to install, you want a certified <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/">licensed contractor</a> to do the job safely and reliably. Currently, ventless fireplaces are not available in all 50 U.S. States; California and Massachusetts don’t allow them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a ventless fireplace?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A ventless fireplace is a freestanding unit that generates heat through the burning of fuel, without requiring a chimney or flue to exhaust combustion air to the outdoors. The heat comes from a burned fuel supply, such as gas or propane, or a gel canister—never wood. Oxygen is drawn from the room for combustion and then vented back into the room as heated air. There is a third option, electric, which gives off far less heat but still creates a pretty simulation of a flame.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operating options with the ventless fireplace</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gas or propane:</strong> This version requires the flow of gas or propane, so installation is limited to those areas where a supply line can be installed, most commonly on a wall or within an existing masonry fireplace. This option requires installation by a licensed gas or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gas or propane supplies a “clean” fire; there is no soot or ash as the logs or stones are actually made of a noncombustible material, such as ceramic fiber. Heat generated can go as high as 25,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units), enough to heat a great room. Consult with your contractor to be certain you choose a size that is appropriate for the space into which it will go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alcohol-based gel canisters:</strong> Here, the fuel is completely self-contained within a canister requiring no pipeline, so placement of the fireplace can go just about anywhere—even the middle of the room if you want. The gel-fueled units ignite with a match and typically burn for two hours before requiring replacement. Heat generated averages about 9,000 BTUs, suitable for a bedroom or like-sized living area, although these units are mostly specified for aesthetics. If you must extinguish the fire before the two hours are up, you will have to dispose of the canister. It should not be reignited later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electric:</strong> This is the most straightforward ventless fireplace to operate. Electric units need only a 120-volt outlet nearby. Plug in the unit and enjoy the simulated flames. Heat output is less than the other options discussed above, about 4,500 BTUs, but this is a good choice if you are more desirous of looks than heating function.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design and customization</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are plenty of options to achieve a one-of-a-kind look for a particular room or setting. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.hearthcabinet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hearth Cabinet Ventless Fireplaces</a> offer a wide variety of fireproof treatments for the interior finish of the cavity, such as tile in a range of patterns or a metal finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers also offer a selection for the decorative element that conceals or surrounds the flame, including materials such as fireproof ceramic fiber logs, river stones, or glass chips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All units come with fireproof glass doors or a steel mesh screen. Manufacturers of ventless fireplaces do not typically supply fireplace surrounds or mantels. Work with a designer and/or contractor to find a ready-made version or have one constructed. Be sure there is sufficient clearance from the heat source so the paint or finish on the surround is not affected when the fire is lit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because ventless fireplaces are not dependent on a chimney, you can group multiples for a dramatic effect in a large room.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of the options above require little maintenance, mainly annual cleaning of the log set and any exposed components. Since a gas leak can be hard to detect, you do want to make sure to install a gas and a carbon monoxide detector in any room where you operate a unit. These detectors should also be checked annually, including battery replacement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years, some concerns have been raised about indoor air emissions from ventless fireplaces fueled by gas or propane. Products made today must meet the requirements of the National Fire Protection Association for all combustible heating appliances. This means that ventless fireplaces made today must have factory-installed carbon monoxide monitors and oxygen detection safety devices (ODS) to automatically shut off the fireplace if the carbon monoxide level in the room rises above 25 parts per million, and/or the oxygen level falls below 18 percent. (These levels for indoor air quality are suggested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Be sure to understand all of the product’s safety features before making a decision, and discuss with the contractor who will be installing the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you are looking for an easy-to-maintain heat source for a favorite room in your home, or you just crave the comfort of a flickering flame while relaxing, a ventless fireplace can provide a relatively simple solution that won’t break the bank. And that’s something to get fired up about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Now you can have America’s-next-top-chef pro-style quality at home</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone" title="a chef's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-723x487.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen with commercial style kitchen appliances" width="723" height="487" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em> (Above)</em> Cara and Jared <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/">kitchen renovation</a></span></p>
<p>When commercial appliances first appeared on the home kitchen scene some 20 years ago, they were the couture of cooking: beautiful, very expensive, and available only to a select few who could manage the price tag and installation. With the renaissance of home entertaining and the widespread popularity of cooking shows, manufacturers have answered the homeowners’ call for a commercial style that can easily fit into a new or renovated kitchen. Looks still lead the way, with shimmering stainless steel and sturdy controls. Function has kept up, too, thanks to improvements in cooking, cooling, and cleaning, to justify that price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Ranges </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s much easier these days to purchase a commercial-style kitchen range for a home. You&#8217;ll find ranges that provide the function you seek, at a size and scale that fits into a home kitchen. Serious at-home chefs covet range features like cast-iron grates, stainless-steel surfaces, and quick-to-heat burners controlled by sizeable knobs. The controls with the <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCS collection from Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> are illuminated, a safety feature that adds an extra touch of glamour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of commercial-style kitchen ranges: they offer flexibility, which home cooks need. One such example is dual fuel, or ranges that feature a gas cooktop plus an electric oven. This provides the immediacy and control of a gas cooktop, with cooking power of up to 25,000 BTUs, and the precise performance of a true convection oven. Modern ranges also have digital panels that help you program correct temperature and cooking times to assure perfect results.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a commercial-style range, there are a few drawbacks you should consider. Some commercial-style kitchen range models have smaller oven cavities than their non-pro-style counterparts, so check the size to make it can handle your Thanksgiving turkey. The self-cleaning feature may also need to be sacrificed if that’s not important to you. Luckily, you’ll make it up in adjustable grates, cooktop grills, and superior simmering capabilities with flames that go as low as 140 degrees. Some brands have unique features. Thermador’s burners, in the shape of the company’s star emblem, disperse the flame heat to more evenly heat the entire surface of a pot. Fisher &amp; Paykel’s racking system allows the rack to extend as much as 75 percent outside the oven cavity, handy when removing a heavy dish, like a roast or a Dutch oven.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Refrigerators</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first commercial kitchen refrigerators to capture the imagination came with glass doors. It&#8217;s ideal for a professional kitchen, as many chefs working together simultaneously need to see what’s inside quickly and easily. For the home cook, <a href="https://true-residential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Refrigeration</a> offers a stainless-framed glass door option reminiscent of that commercial version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key feature of a commercial kitchen fridge is stainless steel. As an external material, it lends a pro-style touch. Also, some manufacturers, like True, offer stainless steel as an interior finish, too. Newer fridge models have black stainless steel for an extra touch of drama. Considering color? <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStar</a> claims to have more than 750 colors and finish combos to match its cooking products.</p>
<h4>Features inside the fridge</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on behind cool-looking doors is just as important to the home chef, who may shop once a week and needs all that food to stay fresh. Look for features like individual climate-controlled drawers, adjustable racking systems, and extra-large shelves to hold entertainment platters and pizzas. <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermador</a> has introduced removable bins on the fridge door that can be loaded with ingredients for meals during the week, then removed to the kitchen counter when it’s time to prep dinner.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-style Dishwasher</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real commercial dishwashers, perhaps surprisingly, lack all the features that homeowners have come to depend on. They basically serve to wash and sanitize, so you won’t find them with adjustable racking systems or garbage disposals. In fact, with a true pro version, you would have to thoroughly rinse the glasses and dishes before placing them in the washer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re set on a commercial-style, dishwasher, start with stainless steel. This sparkling metal says the appliance means business, just like its cooking and cooling counterparts described above. Hefty, architectural handles complete the pro-style effect (unless you prefer a look with controls hidden on the inside panel.) Inside, look for adaptable features like adjustable or removable racks and baskets. As for function, there’s plenty from popular manufacturers to make you happy, including a range of wash cycles, a timer, super-quiet operation, and a childproof lock. Want all the bells and whistles? Spring for a third rack from manufacturers like Bosch, or a built-in water softener from <a href="https://www.jennair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn-Air</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-Style Kitchen Faucets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucet</a> two decades ago forever changed our impression of this indispensable kitchen tool. Finally, with minimum effort (and splashing), you could spray the entire sink—as well as the inside of a pasta pot. Commercial-style kitchen faucets take this advantage a step further. Many offer single-handle operation, a higher-than-average arc, and a spray that can swivel 360 degrees. Look to plumbing experts like <a href="https://www.isenbergfaucets.com/kitchen/">Isenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/kitchen-faucets/article/CNT125900008.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and <a href="https://www.grohe.us/kitchen/kitchen-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a> for more handy options. There are even options for foot control, for completely hands-free operation, like the pros enjoy. If you love sparkling water, Grohe also makes a pro-style faucet that puts fizz in your tap water when you want it.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peek inside a commercial kitchen and you’re likely to see stainless steel on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter surfaces</a>. The sanitary, odor- and moisture-impervious benefits are obvious. However, dings and scratches become pretty obvious. If the patina of usage isn’t for you, check out natural or engineered stone. Professional chefs love it for the same reasons homeowners do: it can take heat without scorching, yet stays cool to the touch. Natural stones such as granite and marble will, nevertheless, show stains, so if you don’t want to risk marring the perfect surface, consider an engineered stone like <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa/what-is-dekton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a> or <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone</a>, which claim to resist all liquids, including wine and juice.</p>
<h4>Creating a commercial-style kitchen at home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning a kitchen renovation involves loads of decisions as you work your way through all the choices for appliances and materials. Commercial style kitchens, while at the higher end of the budget spectrum, remains a classic, and a trend with staying power, if you take the time to find those products that sync with your individual cooking style.

<p class="p1">Of all the features in the bath, the tub takes center stage. In particular, the freestanding tub can take on a shape that turns it into a sculpture and a unique focal point for the room. If you are considering adding a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dimension to your bathroom</a>, read on for <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s</a> <span class="s1">bathroom remodeling ideas with a tub.</span></p>
<p class="p3">There have been a lot of advances since the days of the good, old clawfoot tub, although you can have that if you want it. There are loads of options to help you create a custom look, such as:</p>
<p>*Fluid, sculptural profiles in symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes</p>
<p>*Non-slip surfaces</p>
<p>*Color on the interior and/or exterior</p>
<p>*Backs with lumbar support</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All major manufacturers, including American Standard, Signature Hardware, and DXV, offer a wide dollar range that can keep the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price for your bathroom remodel</a> within your budget.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Choose a style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to the sleek profiles of freestanding tubs, most styles will work with any type of décor, from traditional to transitional to contemporary. So if you select a style you like, then change your mind in a few years about the design of the bath, chances are you can keep the tub and it will still look right. Manufacturers often create “suites” of fixtures—matching sink, tub, and even toilet—if that’s the look you&#8217;re after.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expect to find freestanding tubs in three basic shapes: oval, rectangular, and round. Most freestanding tubs come with the option of either a footed or “skirted” (concealed) bottom. These are the most common and popular styles:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Floor-set</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Available in a range of profiles from oval or rectangular to round or square, these <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-historic-brownstone-bath-remodel-stays-true-to-its-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tubs sit directly on the floor</a>, with the base covered by a “skirt.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Slipper</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaped like the footwear the name describes, this classic tub shape is higher on one side to encourage reclining. Some versions have equally high sides at either end. To enhance the slipper shape, this tub is most commonly specified with feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Soaking</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This style came into vogue in the ‘90s with the emergence of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at-home spa</a> movement and feng shui. The sides rise as high as the shoulders or neck of an average-size person, so the body is submerged in water. The circumference tends to be smaller than other tubs, so it doesn’t take an entire lake to fill with water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Footed</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably know it as the clawfoot tub; this bathing beauty conjures the ambiance of another era, minus the chore of filling it with water from a wooden bucket! Manufacturers make a variety of foot styles to lend the tub either a vintage or contemporary effect. Innovations include exterior surfaces that can take customized finishes, including paint in the color of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Extras</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with overall bath trends, you can find a few enhancements in some freestanding tubs, including removable pillows, chromotherapy, and air jets.</p>
<h3>Consider the material</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s tubs are made to take daily use and exposure to all types of water and chemicals from soaps as well as cleansers. Still, you need to carefully consider your choice of materials, which affect durability and weight, and the tub’s installation. For instance, a lighter-weight tub, one that’s made of acrylic as opposed to cast iron, will be easier to maneuver during installation, and less likely to require additional support for the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Acrylic</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A type of plastic, this material is appreciated for its many attributes: lightweight with a high gloss, deep-color finish that allows most scratches to be buffed out. Acrylic also allows the water to keep its heat more readily than metals such as cast iron. Because it is a plastic that can be formed, it lends itself well to tubs with molded armrests or other detailing. Fiberglass reinforces the acrylic to help prevent cracking and chipping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Metal</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a metal look interests you, you’re most likely to find it in the soaking tubs category, in copper or stainless steel. Be forewarned: This metal transmits heat, so your bathwater will quickly cool down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Enameled cast iron</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This classic, extremely durable material conveys a smooth, glossy finish. It transmits heat but it also holds heat, so it may take some finagling to get the bathwater the temperature you desire. Cast iron bathtubs are best used on ground floors. Homeowners should check with their plumber to see if additional structural support may be needed.</p>
<h3>Measure properly</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must get accurate dimensions for your space and for the tub you are considering. In addition to the manufacturer’s dimensions, look in a showroom and take the measurement from the distance at the longest point of the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most freestanding tubs average about 5 feet by 2 ½ feet. Their luxurious reputation might cause you to think this type of tub only fits in a large bath. Since they don’t require an alcove or a platform, they can fit in many smaller bathrooms.</p>
<h3>Plan before installation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation goes much like it does for any tub, with a few precautions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Weight</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When researching or shopping for tubs, find out how much the tub weighs, empty as well as full of water. Then consult with your contractor to determine if additional structural support is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pipes</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before settling on your selection, locate the room’s water pipes and where you want to place the drain. Make sure you have enough floor space to position the tub. Check the width of doorways, hallways, and staircases by which the tub will be moved. You don’t want to suddenly discover you have to break through a wall to install that luxurious tub. Be aware that pipes that go from the wall to the tub may show. Consult with your contractor to find a version you can stand to look at day in and day out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Faucet</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the tub standing alone on the floor, you may be wondering where the faucet goes. The most common solution is a floor-mounted fitting centered on the long or short side of the tub. This allows placement of the tub under a window or centered in a space; pretty much anywhere the plumbing lines will allow. If the tub can be installed close to the wall, particularly in a small bath, then a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-weekend-home-in-amagansett-remodels-in-minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wall-mount tub filler</a> will work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some manufacturers make tubs that permit a deck mount of the faucet and its handles. Ask to see all the configurations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drains are positioned either in the center or on the left or right. Consider the location of the plumbing in the bath before choosing or you will have to pay to have the pipes extended or rerouted.</p>
<h3>Tips on maintenance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow your regular cleaning routine but only use manufacturer-recommended products. Not all cleansers work well on all surfaces. A lotion-like cleanser that is suitable for porcelain or enameled cast iron may scratch an acrylic tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thoroughly rinse the surface after bathing and again after cleaning. Leaving cleanser on the tub can permanently harm the finish. Avoid wearing jewelry in the tub or anything else that might scratch acrylic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tub is one of the biggest expenditures you will make in your bath, so invest in quality. The manufacturer should offer a limited lifetime warranty. Follow the instructions for care, using only recommended products. Then breathe a sigh of true relaxation as you settle into the serenity of your beautiful freestanding tub.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to begin your bathroom renovation, securing the expertise of an experienced and <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified general contractor</a> should be at the top of your list.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Set your bathing experience with a wide range of shower heads to satisfy every mood, style, and budget</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26484 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spa shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-17_Cropped.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s your preferred method of bathing? If like most Americans, it’s the shower, then you probably have a showering style. But it may not be the same for all the members of your family. Perhaps you like a gentle relaxing wash, while your partner prefers a bracing, wake-me-up experience. Maybe the type of spray depends on the day. Good news: Many shower heads include adjustable features that let you select the spray pattern and the intensity of the water flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s a lot to consider. As you narrow down the selection, a few factors play first into your decision:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The type of shower experience</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The size of the shower</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The style of your bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Experience:</strong> If you’re going through the trouble to replace the head, or remodel your bath entirely, consider thoughtfully how you shower. What’s the most important function for you? Rinsing off after a workout? Soothing tired muscles? Unwinding with some water therapy? Many manufacturers today offer features that allow you to get a custom luxury experience at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Size:</strong> Take into account, too, the dimensions of the shower. If it’s big enough for two, you may want twin shower heads, or one adjustable and one fixed. Or you may indulge in an oversize rain shower centered overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Style:</strong> Take into account your bath décor. Whether your look is traditional or contemporary, you can find a shower head to suit the space. However, most of the new products tend toward the sleek and straight-lined, which may not suit a Victorian-style bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24334 size-chrono" title="shower panel with rainfall and waterfall features" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-18-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Shower head fixture options</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a simple, inexpensive shower head can provide a satisfying shower, but a higher price point provides more options. Here’s a rundown of the types of shower heads you’ll find as you shop. (Note: Check with your contractor before your final selection. You need to be sure your home’s plumbing can handle the model you want, particularly if you choose to install more than one.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single-head:</strong> The simplest go-to style, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/molly-bathroom-renovation-ditmas-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-head</a> is attached to the wall at the height you determine and then it stays there. Some models come with an adjustable shank so you can tip the head higher or lower or side-to-side, as you wish. You can find this version with one or multiple spray modes, from concentrated to mist and even pulsating, which can be adjusted with a lever or a twirl of an encircling ring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handheld:</strong> Attached to flexible tubing, this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower head</a> can be moved to spray wherever you want, including rinsing down walls after cleaning the shower stall. When not in use, this type hooks into a wall-mounted cradle or onto a slide bar that lets it glide up and down on the wall. Either installation method allows it to be used as a fixed shower head. This is a great option for its versatility and convenience. It also benefits a shared shower with bathers of different heights or a person who may need to be seated when showering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dual-head:</strong> As the term indicates, this style offers two shower heads, one fixed and one handheld. Another <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combo</a> could be a rain shower head and a handheld. A single set of levers or handles controls temperature, but a diverter valve can allow the bather to operate one or the other shower head, or both, at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rain shower head:</strong> This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixture</a> comes round or square in shape. The face is flat and large and fitted with many small holes through which water flows to simulate a rainstorm. The water flow is typically gentle, and best suited to a soothing experience than to routines like washing and rinsing hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shower systems:</strong> More elaborate than a dual-head arrangement, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> typically comprises multiple shower head components including a rain shower head, a hand shower, body sprays, and misters, to achieve an ultra-luxurious spa experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26567 size-chrono" title="rain shower head" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Spray patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shower heads come with a single spray mode, or with multiple functions, like these popular water works:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Full-body spray: a full, even stream of water for daily bathing</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Massage or pulsating spray: emitting a pulsating stream of water tension</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Soft aerated: mixing air and water to provide a gentle flow</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Needle: a fine yet penetrating spray</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of these shower heads will also include settings that let you toggle between wide and narrow water flow. Some manufacturers will go up to 12 settings with varying intensities and combos of the above-described modes. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24008 size-chrono" title="black matte shower fixtures" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Fixture finishes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like your sink faucet, you can expect a vast array of finishes—brushed or polished chrome, brushed or polished nickel, stainless steel, brushed or oil-rubbed bronze, polished or antique brass, as well as baked-on enamel or epoxy finishes that come in a few colors, most commonly black or white.</p>
<p>Manufacturers also boast finishes that resist water spots, particularly an issue if your water is hard, but polished finishes will still require attention with a soft cloth to keep that mirror-like appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26482 size-chrono" title="handheld shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Charles_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="shower heads" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>Saving water</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All shower heads made today are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to emit water at a flow of no more than 2.5 gallons per minute (GPM). Look for the WaterSense label, a program from the EPA that certifies shower components that use no more than 2 GPM, or 20 percent less than the 2.5 GPM requirement. The program also covers standards of performance, so a WaterSense product should offer a satisfying shower experience. Another benefit: In addition to conserving a precious natural resource, you’ll save on your utility bills, including the water heater.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A shower head may be small, but it packs a lot of power in its compact form to give you the bathing experience you want in any given moment. Choose wisely, and enjoy the soothing, rejuvenating, invigorating results. You deserve it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Shower systems offer spa-like luxury, from multi-functional showerheads to a steam shower and chromotherapy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25648 size-chrono" title="shower systems" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="shower systems" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><em>(Above) Leslie&#8217;s renovation with Sweeten resulted in a separate room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full shower system</a> including a steam shower, rain showerheads and jet sprays</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Americans have become highly sophisticated about their renovation choices and preferences. And nowhere is this more evident than in the bath. Homeowners count on their bathrooms to help them rev up in the morning and wind down in the evening. Manufacturers now create elaborate shower systems that provide a luxurious shower experience. Here, Sweeten&#8217;s guide to modern shower systems outlines popular features and add-ons, with tips on adding one into your bathroom remodel plans.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Design to go with the flow</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s begin with the layout. Shower systems should be isolated, almost like a room, and shouldn&#8217;t be part of a tub. While it doesn’t have to be big enough to fit two, there should be enough footage to move around and extend your arms fully. Simple materials and clean lines deliver the best aesthetic to convey a feeling of serenity. This means frameless glass doors and a floor-level shower tray. (Bonus: It’s fully accessible!) A built-in bench, particularly if the shower is clad in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone</a>, adds another luxurious touch. Make sure you assess your plumbing capacity to be sure it can supply sufficient volume pressure. Your water heater must also be ready if you include a steam shower or body jets. (These features often operate at the same time as the shower.) Ensure your contractor evaluates the drain so it evacuates all that water quickly. Next, you&#8217;ll want to plan your shower system features!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxury shower system options</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luxury shower systems in the home go way beyond simple showerheads, even one with diverse spray patterns. The typical luxury shower system is a combination of individual features that come as a unit in a panel, or those you choose individually. You&#8217;ll want a shower head with several spray patterns, a hand shower on a wall-mount slide bar, and several pairs of body jets (six to eight are common). This arrangement should come with a thermostatic diverter that controls the water temperature to a preset degree. This means you don’t have to fiddle with it each time you turn it on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shower panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a few hundred dollars, you can find an all-in-one shower panel at a box store such as Home Depot. (This is at least half of what you would spend on a shower system of individual components.) The panel includes a showerhead, two to eight body jets, and an adjustable hand shower. Advantageously, a shower panel provides quick installation at a price that fits most budgets. The disadvantage: the panel mounts to the wall, extending several inches into the shower space. If you want a sleeker look, you will need to go with individual components that recess into the wall. Either way, make sure that your plumbing provides sufficient water pressure for all the features to operate simultaneously. If not, your contractor should make adjustments before installation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rain shower heads</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An increasingly popular type of luxury shower head is the rain shower head. Rain shower heads are preferred for the soothing effect that its name indicates. These luxury-type shower heads can be mounted to the wall and angled to drop directly down, or installed on the ceiling. Look for an extra-wide spray span, as much as 15 inches, and a choice of spray patterns, from gentle to drenching. <a href="https://www.grohe.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohe</a> and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> also offer digital controls with their rain shower systems. These controls allow you to preset your favorite spray pattern with your preferred water temperature. You simply push a button to start your shower and enter your specific experience. Kohler developed a showering panel that simulates the varying sizes and angles of raindrops as they fall, for a fully sensory occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to splurge, you can get a shower panel installed in the ceiling that will shower you with several spray patterns simultaneously. This requires special framing for the ceiling, so you need to plan this feature before you start your renovation.</p>

<h3>Body sprays</h3>
<p>These components allow for water therapy that hits every inch of your body to soothe or stimulate. Surface-mounted or recessed, the sprays are typically installed in pairs. Pay careful attention to placement, particularly if people of varying heights will use the shower. Swivel body sprays can help for minor adjustments. The top-level jets target the shoulders, the middle, the waist or hips, and the lowest, the thighs or knees. Some jets pop out when in operation, then retract when the water is turned off. You can find these sprays in the classic faucet and showerhead finishes—chrome, nickel, bronze, polished or brushed—and in square or round shapes from most major manufacturers including <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>, Kohler, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a>, Grohe, <a href="https://www.deltafaucet.com/bathroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://www.moen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steam</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technological advances have made it possible to bring the coveted spa experience of steam into modern homes. The operation appears simple: steam is emitted by heads installed on the shower wall, and operated by a control pad programmed for temperature and session length. However, you will need to plan with your contractor to allow for several precautions. Don&#8217;t forget: steam showers generate more moisture and heat than a regular shower. As a result, your contractor will first install vapor proofing material to prevent water vapor from seeping through the walls. The shower door should be airtight, too, so water doesn’t escape to create mildew on wallpaper and paint. The ceiling should be curved so that condensed vapor droplets run down the walls, instead of dripping on you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For operation, a steam shower requires a generator and a ventilation unit. Both of these features are concealed from sight. Accordingly, your contractor can help you to determine the best, most effective placement for each. Alternatively, you can buy a stand-alone steam shower, complete with rain shower, hand shower, massage jets, whirlpool tub, steam generator, and LED lighting. Companies that specialize in steam showers, as well as major manufacturers like Kohler or <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>, offer many choices. If you don&#8217;t want to go the custom route, a two-person unit will cost you about $2,000. If you are creating a custom steam shower, expect your costs to double, to about $4,000. For either route: work with a contractor to ensure properly-installed plumbing and electricity.</p>

<h4>Seating for shower systems</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning to introduce a steam shower to your bathroom, plan for it to be big enough for at least two people to use. Also, allow footage for a bench for lounging and even reclining.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Chromotherapy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that humans crave the healing power of light based on our innate need for sunlight and full-spectrum light in wintertime. You can isolate the individual colors that make up full-spectrum for healing effects in the bath. This is called chromotherapy. You’ll want at least four <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lights</a> installed in your shower ceiling for even illumination. You can find LED versions in primary colors, and connect them to a separate switch in the shower. Amazon sells chromotherapy bulbs in seven colors—orange, red, blue, aqua, indigo, green, and yellow. You can change them at will, or set them to cycle through all the colors. Make sure your contractor adds a dimming capability. You can also choose a chromotherapy package made to go with a tub or steam shower enclosure from a manufacturer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Adding music to your shower system</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once upon a time, you set your radio on the counter to listen to news and music. Kohler is among a handful of manufacturers that lets you bring music right into the shower. They offer a shower head with a wireless speaker that you can connect to your phone with Bluetooth® technology. The speaker docks in the center of the showerhead when in use, and is removable for recharging the battery, which lasts up to seven hours. The showerhead is available as a wall-mount or rain shower. Grohe also makes a rechargeable wireless speaker that attaches to the slide bar of the hand shower. For under $100, you can opt for wireless Bluetooth® speakers, compatible with most smartphones, that attach to the wall by suction cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to the bathroom, it makes sense that your shower should provide the personalized experience you seek. By adding one or all of the features described above, you can luxuriate in your favorite spa rituals every day without leaving home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

			<h2>Don’t be left in the dark; bathroom lighting is an essential selection you shouldn&#8217;t get wrong</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22794" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">As with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/"><span class="s1">kitchen lighting</span></a>, bathroom lighting requires a plan to effectively illuminate all the action that takes place here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Yet often, lighting is an afterthought, “solved” with one ceiling light smack in the center of the room. The key to how to light a bathroom is a layered or three-part approach, with a combination of ambient, task, and accent lights. Together they create the soothing environment you crave.</p>
<p class="p1">The plan also ensures every design feature in the bath shows to its best advantage. The place where you start and end your day, the refuge where you go to recharge, deserves better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Three basic types of lighting</span></h3>
<p>A bathroom lighting plan combines three types of illumination according to the space’s purpose. Since the bath typically hosts both personal-care tasks and relaxation, you want to include each of the following:</p>
<h4><span class="s1">Ambient lighting</span></h4>
<p>Also known as general lighting, this type illuminates an overall space so that with the flick of a switch you can see and move around safely and confidently. The most common and easy-to-install type is overhead ceiling-mount fixtures or recessed cans, particularly if the ceiling is low.</p>
<p>Space permitting, you can get more creative with a chandelier, a few pendants, or track lighting. Note: As bright as good ambient lighting makes a room, it won’t eliminate shadows when you’re at the sink, so you also need task lighting.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24574 size-full" title="bathroom wet room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="bathroom wet room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Top photo)</em> Sweeten homeowner</span> <span style="color: #76808f;">Kimberly&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation</a>. <span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Leslie&#8217;s</span> <span style="color: #76808f;">Sweeten</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">bathroom remodel</a></p>
<h4><span class="s1">Task lighting</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the term indicates, this type of bathroom lighting serves to illuminate specific tasks that take place at specific stations—the sink, the tub, the shower, and the toilet or water closet. How you light a bathroom for tasks is determined by the type of fixture, its location within the room, and your taste.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">At the sink, the greatest variety of activities happen, from shaving and applying makeup to inserting contact lenses. Here, you want light free from glare and shadows and bright enough to prevent eyestrain. Your best bet is twin wall sconces mounted at eye level to avoid those shadows.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If wall space is so limited that you can only manage overhead lighting at the sink, install a horizontal fixture above the mirror or a medicine cabinet with integrated lighting (see below) that won’t cast shadows or glare.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For the tub, you need overhead lighting above this large area. Recessed lighting works here, but if the tub is a focal point of the bath, you could add a chandelier. Track lighting also works, with the bulbs directed specifically at the tub area. You may want to consider a dimmer so you can have that spa-like moment when you want it. The shower is the most humid environment, with water that can splash up to the ceiling. Here, stick with recessed lighting, making sure it covers the faucet area and the floor or door where you get out.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If your toilet is in a water closet, you want recessed lighting so you won’t bump your head when standing up.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="s1">Accent lighting</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This category pinpoints areas of visual interest, for example, to highlight a tile treatment in the shower, artwork on a wall, a cove ceiling, or woodwork on a pretty vanity. Recessed and track lighting work well for most treatments. Under-cabinet lighting serves to add drama to cabinetry and as a nightlight after bedtime.</p>

<h3>How to light a bathroom safely</h3>
<p>Electricity and water don’t mix but they are unavoidably close in the bath. Your general contractor will hire a certified electrician to assess the layout and submit permits. Among other things, the contractor will fit all outlets with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs). Lighting fixtures within a certain distance of the tub or shower (check your community’s codes; it varies from town to town) must be &#8220;wet&#8221; or &#8220;shower-location&#8221; rated. If you want a furnished look in the bath, with a table or floor lamp, always, always make sure it is well clear of any wet area should it tip over. This means you would never place it on the counter next to the sink or on the floor by the tub.</p>

<h3>How to light a bathroom with special features</h3>
<p>While bathroom lighting is undeniably about function, it also provides fashion. Whatever your style—traditional, contemporary, industrial, vintage—you’ll find fixtures suited for the wall and ceiling.</p>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Integrated lighting</span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Medicine cabinets and mirrors can light up with integrated fluorescent or LED bulbs, perfect for a sleek effect or when wall space is at a minimum. Integrated lighting in a whirlpool can enhance your spa moments. Colored lights recessed in the tub surface create a soothing underwater light show—a.k.a. chromatherapy—while you soak.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/113569_Dan_Apt_016.jpg" alt="Dark wood floating bathroom vanity with toilet paper storage" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53990" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/113569_Dan_Apt_016.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/113569_Dan_Apt_016-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/113569_Dan_Apt_016-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></span></p>

<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Dimmers and wattage</span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Place task lighting on a dimmer to let your eyes gradually adjust in the morning. Dimmers also partner with ambient lighting, when you get up in the middle of the night, or just want to relax in the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg" alt="bathroom skylight" width="667" height="1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49434" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Amy + Kevin&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom skylight</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While placement of lighting is important, so is the brightness and the type of bulb. When choosing bulbs for ambient lighting, look for the warmest light; it resembles natural light the most, usually 2700K LEDs. In a choice of compact fluorescent (CFL) and LED, bathrooms typically employ the equivalent of 75– to 100–watt incandescent bulbs. For fixtures around a medicine cabinet mirror used for close-up activity, opt for 150 watts or the equivalent in CFLs or LEDs. Dimmable versions are available too. For brightness in the bath, figure 75 to 100 watts for incandescents, which translates to 24– to 26–watt CFLs and 14– to 18–watt LEDs. The description on the packaging should provide the conversion for you.</p>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">Occupancy sensor wall switch</span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This simple feature can be found in many hotel baths; why shouldn’t you have it as well? Your contractor can advise as to placement that triggers the lights to come on when you enter the bath, then switch off when you exit. (Great for family members who forget to turn off the lights, too!)</p>
<h4 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skylights</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether or not your bath includes windows, a skylight (no electricity needed here!) will fill the room with light, even on a gloomy day, thus helping to save a bit on your utility bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The home bath has become a retreat, offering a place of relaxation from the outside (and sometimes inside!) world. Properly planned lighting can enhance your every experience there, to enhance both safety as well as a sense of comfort—just what you want, and deserve, from your bath.</p>
