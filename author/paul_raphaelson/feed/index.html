Photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></p>
<h3>Why is the scope of work important?</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Scope of work” or &#8220;scope&#8221; is construction lingo for the list of work that needs to be done in a remodeling project. When a contractor asks for <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your project scope</a>, they’re really asking, “What are all the things you need me to do?” Sweeten breaks it all down below.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the scope of work?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Early in your planning, like when you first post your project on the Sweeten platform or start talking to general contractors, your scope will likely be vague. For example, “I want to renovate the master bathroom, including retiling and replacing cabinets and fixtures.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later, when it comes time to ask general contractors for estimates, you’ll work with them to fill in the details. These important details make up the scope of work! The details will cover the exact work that needs to be done, including materials and fixture specifics, and plans drawn for any changes to the layout, pipes, or wiring (see “Renovation scope of work example” below). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All the specifics need to be in writing by the time you ask for a contract. Once you’ve signed, additional changes to the scope of work are considered “change orders,” and will bring additional costs.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finessing your budget and scope of work</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often, you won’t be able to move from a general to specific scope until you know the cost of all the options. We suggest making a list of everything you want, divided into <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.”</a> Your general contractor can help you decide on a specific scope that fits your budget, including as many “nice-to-haves” as possible. </span></p>
<h4>My scope exceeds my budget. Now what?</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your contractor makes <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/can-i-ask-my-contractor-for-a-revised-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an estimate that exceeds your budget</a>, it’s time to negotiate. Please don’t just ask for a discount. General contractors operate on very low margins; you’d be asking them to lose money. Instead, ask questions about how to adjust the scope to fit your budget. You might get some surprising and imaginative ideas. Sweeten general contractors are often wizards at this kind of creative problem-solving to make potential clients happy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling rule-of-thumb: The more rigid your budget, the more flexible your scope should be. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">If a scope of work isn’t possible</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally a general contractor will tell you that something in your scope is impossible. This can be disappointing—but we promise, they’re not just being difficult. Sometimes there will be structural reasons that something can’t be done. Other times there will be strict national or local building codes that have to be obeyed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pro tip: Always ask why something in the scope can’t be done. You might start a conversation with your contractor that leads to ideas that are just as satisfying as the original.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Prep scopes before the estimate</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might want to consider more than one scope. For example, one version might be a kitchen remodel that includes changing the floor plan and opening a wall. Another version could be a simple rip-and-replace of the existing cabinets and finishes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s fine to present these alternate versions to your general contractor, as long as you do so before asking them to create any estimates. And you should keep it to just two variations. Beyond two, your contractor might ask for an additional deposit—because drawing up detailed estimates is time-consuming work.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Example of a scope of work in construction</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace toilet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace vanity cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Change out sink<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Retile floor<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Relocate shower—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Install cement board<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Tile shower/tub surround<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Replace light fixture<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Add outlets—see plans<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Paint walls and ceiling</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The scope of work, in summary</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Start with a general scope, with your must-haves and nice-to-haves. Moving on to your final, detailed scope requires negotiating many variables. Your Sweeten general contractor can be a valuable resource in this process. Be sure to communicate clearly, ask questions, and give as much information as possible before requesting a bid. And remember: the details in a contract finalize your scope. Any additions to the scope after you’ve signed the contract will be considered a change order, which might push you over budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Sweeten matches you with vetted general contractors</h3>

<p>In addition to cash, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, many homeowners pay for their renovations with Federal Housing Administration 203(k) loans.</p>
<h3>How do 203(k) loans work?</h3>
<p>These federal loans come with strings attached: they can only pay for specific categories of work, they release funds in two lump payments, and they often require the client to hire a HUD consultant. They pay a maximum of $35,000.</p>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans can be used to:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Improve a home’s functionality or attractiveness</li>
<li>Eliminate health and safety hazards</li>
<li>Rehab the plumbing or sewer systems</li>
<li>Install or repair the roof, gutters, and downspouts</li>
<li>Install or replace the flooring</li>
<li class="li1">Improve major aspects of the landscaping<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ensure accessibility for a disabled person<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make a home more energy-efficient<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans<span class="s1"> can’t be used to:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make structural repairs or improvements<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Work on a rental property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new construction / room additions<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new swimming pools<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build tennis courts, gazebos, or bathhouses<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build other “luxury items”<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Payment schedule</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FHA will pay the homeowner a partial sum when the 203(k) loan is approved, and the remainder at the conclusion of the project, typically after all required inspections. You won’t be able to negotiate for payments in-between these official ones.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to handle 203(k) loans</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, decide if you’re willing to accept them at all. You’ll get more work if you do, but you’ll have to be ok with the payment schedule, and possibly additional paperwork. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether you choose to accept 203(k) loans or not, bring up the topic early in discussions with a potential client, before submitting an estimate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the client plans to use a 203(k) loan, this will put hard constraints on the project scope, the budget, and the payment schedule. You’ll have to figure all of this out before you draft the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You absolutely don’t want to have a signed contract in hand, and then hear, “By the way, we’re paying with a 203(k)!”</span></p>

			<h2>Yes, revised estimates are possible, but be ready to compromise and collaborate</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-doors" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg" alt="Living room with doors and room view before renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51371" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GC_Estimate_Revision-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve received a remodeling estimate from your Sweeten general contractor. What if the total exceeds your budget—can you ask for a revised estimate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short answer: Yes, with limitations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>When can I ask for a lower or revised renovation estimate?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can generally expect a single round of minor revisions for free. If you need major scope changes or multiple versions of the estimate, expect your contractor to ask for money up-front. This is because calculating estimates requires substantial work. If you hire the contractor, this fee will typically be treated as a deposit and will count toward the total renovation cost. You won’t be out-of-pocket unless you ask a contractor for extensive revisions and then decline to hire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What revisions are considered minor? Minor revisions involve eliminating part of the project or making simple substitutions (switching from custom imported tiles to standard subway tiles, etc.).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you negotiate for a lower price, you must always think in terms of reduced scope or lower-priced materials. Don’t just ask for a discount! General contractors don’t leave room for discounts in their estimates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely ask your contractor for advice on how to meet a lower budget. Their experience can be invaluable in strategizing where to cut costs<span>—</span>and where not to. </span></p>
<h3>Ballpark quote vs. formal remodeling estimate</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind the difference between a contractor’s initial ballpark quote and their formal estimate. That first quote may be based on your posted Sweeten project and a brief conversation. The formal estimate will come after a site visit, a longer discussion, and hours of behind-the-scenes research and calculation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you receive your initial quote, this is the time to discuss your budget limits and to be clear about your must-haves vs. your nice-to-haves. Giving your <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor the important information up-front</a> will help you avoid major revisions entirely.</span></p>
<h3>Do:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discuss your scope and budget with your contractor before they draft an estimate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your site visit, feel free to postpone requesting an estimate. If you need time to think about your budget, ask for it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your contractor for advice on reducing the scope to meet your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for major estimate revisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to wait a few days for major estimate revisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Don’t:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a discount without a change in scope or materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a formal estimate before you’re clear on your budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions for free</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect major revisions quickly</span></li>

			<h2>Providing deposits for contractors is a crucial<span>—and normal—step in starting a renovation</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="room-ready-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg" alt="Image of room ready for renovation" width="1000" height="665" class="alignnone wp-image-51631 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/33-upfront-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short answer: Yes. </span><span class="s1">But there are exceptions, and your contractor may have some flexibility. Below, Sweeten outlines the reasons behind upfront payment amounts, and some options for negotiating your deposit for a contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do contractors require a deposit?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deposits for contractors are critical because they essentially allow your project to begin! Your general contractor needs to secure a crew and begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordering materials right away</a>. They may also need to rent equipment. And your contractor can’t take on all the financial liability for these commitments themself.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much of a deposit can a contractor ask for? </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exact deposit amount contractors ask for upfront varies and is especially dependent on the size of the project. For relatively small jobs, like a $16,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">bathroom remodel</a>, contractors may ask for a 50% deposit. For large jobs, like a $100,000 <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/">full-home renovation</a>, a 10%–20% deposit is more typical. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Is the deposit for a contractor negotiable?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be. In many cases, contractors start with a standardized contract, so some of the terms could be based on a typical job rather than the specifics of yours. You may be able to ask for somewhat lower initial payment or deposit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal time to ask is during negotiations (—an important part of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">the contractor hiring process</a>), before the contractor drafts the contract. But they may be amenable to a minor contract alteration after the fact. Just know that their flexibility may be limited. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What about the remaining payments?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors use a number of different fee structures. The payment schedule might be based on fixed dates, or on major project milestones. For small jobs, they’ll typically ask for just two payments—one upfront, the other at the end. For larger projects, there may be as many as five scheduled payments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most contractors ask for the final payment upon “substantial completion.” This means that everything’s complete except the punch list*, and possibly final work on minor finishes. Occasionally, a contractor will consider a job substantially complete when there’s a single large outstanding item—like an expensive fixture that’s held up by a shipping delay, but which won’t require much labor to install. When you&#8217;re ready to begin your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/">find a vetted and experienced contractor</a>. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">*The punch list is a tally of any minor problems for the contractor to fix—like a paint splatter, a missing drawer pull, a misaligned cabinet hinge, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Points to remember for contractor deposits:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a deposit for a contractor before work can begin<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Expect to pay a higher percentage on a smaller job, and vice-versa<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Discuss the contractors&#8217; deposit and payment schedule before they draft the contract<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">If you’d like to amend the contract, don’t expect the contractor to have unlimited flexibility<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication is key to a happy client, a good review, and building goodwill</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes a job a success? A happy client—and ideally, a great review and great portfolio pictures, to help you win more jobs. Sweeten outlines how to aim for that happy client and glowing review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Think about your end game at the beginning</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">When negotiating your contract, ask for permission to shoot “after” pictures.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Be 100% clear about the punch list and schedule. Don’t leave room for misaligned expectations.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Define “completion” in the contract. Be explicit. If you promise to leave the space “broom clean,” explain clearly what this means. If the client would like you to hand over the space in more pristine condition, this is the time to negotiate.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate—and reduce—the client’s stress level</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Remember that the client probably hasn’t done this before, and doesn’t know what to expect. Tell them clearly about your process and what they’ll experience.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any delays, any days when no one will be working at the site, any problems.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any damage—even if you plan to fix it right away. You don’t want them visiting the site and getting upset because they discovered some spilled paint!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that permits might remain open for several weeks after completion and that this is normal.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask for a review</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ideally ask at a late milestone, like when reviewing the punch list<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask in person, and make it clear that it means a lot to you<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Follow up </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Check in with the client a month or so after completion<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Thank them for the review (or ask them again if they’d consider leaving one)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask how they feel about the work, now that they’ve had a chance to live with it (Chances are high that they’ll be happy, and you’ll just be building good will. If the client has complaints, this is your chance to fix them.)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Check-in with Sweeten</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Debrief your account manager on the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Are you especially proud of this project? Ask if Sweeten will consider it for the blog.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>

			<h2>4 advantages of getting multiple estimates for your remodel</h2>
<h3><img decoding="async" title="workers-remodelling-living-room" class="alignnone wp-image-50479 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03.jpg" alt="workers remodelling a living room during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/competitive-bidding-cover_jane-living-room-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p>Competitive bidding means inviting three to five general contractors to submit an estimate, or bid, for your remodeling project. Then, after carefully comparing the bids, you can hire the right contractor with confidence.</p>
<p>This is standard practice in the wider world of construction. At Sweeten, our roots are in the construction industry—our founders are trained architects—and we believe competitive bidding is the ideal approach to planning home renovations. We suggest you ask for bids from at least 3 general contractors before hiring one. When it comes to getting estimates for your remodel, having multiple options gives you more flexibility and choice.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Competitive bidding empowers you to:</h3>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/qa-with-jean-should-i-take-the-lowest-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a highly competitive price</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Know you’re getting the specific services you need</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ design ideas and solutions</li>
<li aria-level="1">Compare contractors’ communication styles and personalities</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll feel assured that you’ve chosen the right contractor, that you’re getting the right services, and that you’ve been quoted the right price. It’s a magical way to find peace of mind, without any second-guessing.</p>
<h3>How the bidding process works at Sweeten</h3>
<h4>Sweeten is the only renovation service that actively supports competitive bidding. It’s baked into our process from the start. With Sweeten you’ll get:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A list of recommended, trusted contractors who are perfectly matched to your renovation. You can pick your favorites and invite them to bid on your project with a single click. Every general contractor we match you with will be well-qualified for the kind of renovation you&#8217;re planning, your budget range, and the design services you need. You get to choose based on the intangibles, like whether you prefer to work with a large or small company, which contractor’s portfolio projects you prefer, and you find easiest to communicate with.</li>
<li>Messaging tools available right in your Sweeten dashboard, to make setting up site visits simple and fast. We also include a video chat feature, so contractors can meet with you remotely, to save time and maintain social distancing.</li>
<li>A free bid-leveling call with one of our renovation specialists, to help you understand your bids—and get inside information on the individual contractors. This invaluable service helps you see the big picture make the most informed choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the bid-leveling call, we encourage you to ask anything, whether about your renovation, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors bidding</a> on your project, or the Sweeten process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Check these boxes before hiring your contractor: experience, competitive bids, and support during your renovation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="narrow-passageway-staircase" class="alignnone wp-image-49342 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4.jpg" alt="narrow passage way with staircase and white floor during renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3">What’s the best way to find a contractor for your renovation? Who will make the most trustworthy recommendation? It’s tempting to turn to friends and family, as you would when looking for a restaurant or babysitter. Before you decide to just use your friend&#8217;s general contractor, there are a few vital questions you should ask yourself. We outline these questions, with the possible pros and cons, in this guide.</p>
<h3 class="p3">How much experience is the friend/family recommendation based on?</h3>
<p class="p3">Has your friend done one renovation with this general contractor? Two? How are they able to compare their contractors to the dozens or hundreds who may serve your area?</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We benefit from the experience of over 2,000 successful home renovations. We’ve worked with hundreds of general contracting firms, many for several years. We also benefit from a founder and team members who are trained architects with extensive industry experience. We know how to evaluate general contractors!</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">How similar was their renovation to the one you’re planning?</h3>
<p class="p3">The best contractor for a bathroom remodel might not be the best choice for a full-house gut renovation. Similarly, the best contractor for build-only renovation may not be the best choice for one that requires design or architecture services.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors have performed every kind of renovation for every kind of home. We know every detail about the general contractors in our network: specialties, budget ranges, design services offered, experience in specific buildings, and even communication styles. We can match you with contractors who are perfectly equipped to succeed at your project.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">Will you get a competitive bid?</h3>
<p class="p3">Will your friend/family be able to recommend more than one contracting company? This is all that most non-professionals are able to offer. Unfortunately, without multiple contractors competing for your project, you’ll have no way of knowing if your bid is competitive—or even reasonable.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We match you with a curated shortlist of appropriate general contractors. We make it easy for you to connect with three or more, and to solicit bids from each. This allows you to make an informed choice, and to hire with confidence.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">Will you get expert support?</h3>
<p class="p3">You&#8217;ll probably have some questions. How do I prepare for a site visit? What should I ask each contractor? How do I get the most accurate bids? How do I compare bids that are organized differently and include different line items? What design or architecture services I’ll need?</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We’ll happily answer all your questions. We even offer a call dedicated to comparing your bids. We don’t charge for any of these services.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What happens if something goes wrong during the renovation?</h3>
<p class="p3">If you use a friend&#8217;s general contractor, and the contractor turns out to be a problem, your friend/family will not be in a position to help.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">With our vetting criteria in place, we start with prevention: all of our contractors have met <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our standards</a>—they’re fully insured, they meet all required state and local licensing requirements, and they’ve been in business long enough to earn solid reputations. We’ve interviewed them, interviewed their previous clients, and in many cases, we’ve been working with them for years.</p>
<p class="p3">In the unlikely event of a problem with your Sweeten general contractor that you can’t resolve on your own, we will step in and help.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Sweeten can help</h4>
<p class="p3">Sometimes you need your best friend … and sometimes you need a team of trained architects who have facilitated thousands of successful renovations and who offer financial protection.</p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="general-contractor-with-helmet" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Become-a-GC.jpg" alt="Contractor with helmet at the renovation site" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51174" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Become-a-GC.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Become-a-GC-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Become-a-GC-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Why be a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you’re ambitious and have experience in the construction industry, general contracting offers a unique career path from a worker to a business owner. Interested? We hope you’ll find Sweeten&#8217;s following guide helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What is a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A general contractor is a person (and company) that coordinates and supervises construction projects, including renovations. This includes securing required permits, and hiring, scheduling, and overseeing all the subcontractors (masons, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In most areas, general contractors are required to be licensed, and to carry worker’s compensation insurance, as well as specialized liability for construction. The general contractor is financially responsible for any injuries or property damage at the job site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Are there different kinds of general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yes. Contracting companies can offer a range of services. Some are “build-only” firms, which only work from drawings provided by the client. Others are full-service “design-build” firms, which will have designers and possibly even architects on staff. And there’s a spectrum between these extremes, including firms that can offer advice on materials and finishes, and firms that make architect referrals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There’s also a range of firm sizes. Some are sole-proprietorships or 2-person partnerships. Others have many employees, including front office staff. As you’d expect, most general contracting firms start small and grow over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What does Sweeten look for in general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten expects professionalism, great communication skills, an outstanding portfolio, and the following objective qualifications:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">All required general contractor licensing for your service area</span></li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A certificate of insurance for General Liability coverage</span></p>
</li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A business registered under the same name for at least 6 months&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Who can become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The field is open to anyone; there are no specific physical or educational requirements. However, your chances of success will be greatest if you have experience in the construction industry. This can include a construction trade, design, project management, estimating, or property management.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Be aware that the job is mostly about management and running a business. Your knowledge, administrative skills, and people skills will be more important than your ability to swing a hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How to become a general contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There are two common paths to take. Each can prepare you to get licensed and registered, so you to can take on jobs that require hiring subcontractors:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for yourself in your trade (as a carpenter, plumber etc.)</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for another company, and work up to a supervisory role&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What’s the worst way to become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Start out as a designer, and hire subcontractors to complete projects—even though you don’t have a general contracting license or construction insurance. Unfortunately, this is common, and is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How do I become licensed?</span></h3>

The first is to work for yourself in a chosen trade, like a carpenter, plumber, etc. The second way is to work for another company and work up to a supervisory role; overseeing a team of subcontractors who specialize in multiple fields. Depending on the state you live in, you may also need to become licensed and registered with the state.</p> </div> </div>

<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="orange-living-room-during"  class="alignnone wp-image-50681 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg" alt="orange living room in the process of renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Sweeten knows that as a general contractor, you handle multiple jobs simultaneously—you sometimes bend your schedule to accommodate delivery delays, permit snags, sick subcontractors, and whatever else tomorrow brings.</p>
<p class="p2">But your client probably doesn’t know any of this. Here are our tips for setting expectations—the key to happy clients and great reviews.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Be upfront and transparent about how you work</h3>
<p class="p2">Explain early that you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crews working on multiple jobs</a>, and that it’s normal, say, for the electrician to run off to work on a different project. And that it’s normal for there to be hours—or even days—when there are no workers on site. Explain that some work may have to wait for materials to be delivered, or for adhesives to dry.</p>
<p class="p2">Make it clear that circumstances often force schedule changes. Then let clients know ASAP any time there’s a delay or if work has to pause. An informed client is a happier client.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Be patient and open-minded during client conversations</h3>
<p class="p2">Remember that your client has probably never done this before. Questions that could seem insulting often just come from a lack of understanding about construction, or anxieties about their home being jackhammered. Please don’t take these questions personally! Answer as patiently and clearly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Emerging Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">If <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-general-contractors-does-sweeten-work-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’re new to Sweeten</a>, you might feel tempted to bend over backward to make clients happy. We’ve seen GCs perform work outside of scope without creating a change order, etc.  Please don’t go crazy—you’re a business, and you need to treat clients as clients.</p>
<p class="p2">Stepping outside the bounds of the contractor-client relationship can lose money for you, and can create false expectations. Clients who think you’re a friend doing them a favor can feel betrayed when you start acting like a business!</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Established Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">Be patient and clear when explaining why you can’t comply with a request. If it’s a technical or a code restraint, the client will be much more satisfied if they understand. Don’t let them think you’re just inflexible. You might be able to work together to find a compromise.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Remember your Sweeten Account Manager</h3>
<p class="p2">If you’re having trouble communicating something to a client, talk to us! We can always jump in and help.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with an average of $80,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pay Only-When-You-Win business model</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You only pay us when you win a job. Sweeten doesn&#8217;t charge you to sign up with us, and we don’t charge you for leads. Our fee is a small percentage of the total contract value. Most contracting firms consider it a business development expense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is this important? We only get paid when you get paid. It doesn’t serve us to waste your time by sending you dozens of low-quality leads, or by sending the same leads to dozens of random contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten cares about your success—we consider you a partner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Highest Quality Projects</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We only send you legitimate, transformative renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-renovations-does-sweeten-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects that require multiple trades</a>. We won’t waste your time with single-trade jobs or handyman tasks. Our minimum budget is $15,000. Our average contract value is $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All leads we send you are vetted for readiness and appropriate budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Vetted Leads, Matched to You</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we send you a lead, it will match your geographic service area, the types of services you offer, and your preferred budget range. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Streamlined Competitive Bidding Process</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll compete with just 2 to 4 other contracting firms for each job. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">If you and the client express interest in each other, we give you tools to help with messaging, site visit scheduling, video site visits, and hiring. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">On the client side, we help them understand and compare estimates, to help them make the best choice—even if it’s not the lowest bid.</span><span class="s1"> </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We minimize the time you spend on unpaid work. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Services to Help Contractors Grow</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten also helps contractors by giving you a dedicated account manager to help with business development and marketing. They&#8217;ll also help make your Sweeten profile and portfolio as competitive as possible. We offer opportunities for free photography and social media promotion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We stand behind your work, by offering financial protection to your Sweeten clients. They’ll be able to hire you with confidence and peace of mind. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Want to know how to close projects? Establish trust with your clients and explain your estimate.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49345" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg" alt="booking renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Success depends on that one signature. In this guide, Sweeten shares key tips to how to smooth the process to close projects and getting signed contracts. These practices will reduce time and effort for you while reducing anxiety for the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Establish a process and communicate it early</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re the pro—it’s up to <em>you</em> to know everything you’ll need from the client, and when you’ll need it. Having an established process will help you show confidence and authority, which earns confidence from clients. You may find it helpful to map out the process in writing, even if those notes are just for your own use.</span></p>
<p>If you sense you’re getting positive feedback from the client, you can start discussing next steps as early as the site visit. At the latest, you’ll want to start these discussions when you deliver your estimate.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Communicate clearly and transparently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be shy about discussing your process with the homeowner. Most clients, especially first-time renovators, will be comforted by a confident contractor who leads them through the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs avoid bringing up critical steps, like contracts and payment plans, out of fear that this will scare the homeowner away. Don’t fall into this trap! It’s always better to be upfront. Your transparency inspires confidence and will help you avoid springing surprises on the homeowner at the last minute. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Consider these points:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Are you asking for a large payment upfront? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If yes, explain why—for example, to order materials early and avoid delays, to secure your crew, etc. Conversely, if your payment schedule is flexible or you are asking for a relatively low percentage upfront, use that as a selling point.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Will you take care of permits? If so, which ones? Will there be any costs associated with this work? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Be sure to clearly communicate what will be on the homeowner’s plate to manage and pay for versus what you are providing as value-added services.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Encourage questions! </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Homeowners appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and a healthy dialogue gives you the chance to demonstrate your expertise and listening skills. An informed client is a good client.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Some questions to be prepared for:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can you revise the estimate (itemizing, reorganizing, taking things out, or adding additional line items in, etc.)?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Be sure to set boundaries. Let the client know how many revisions you&#8217;re willing to make.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Is the estimate negotiable?<br />
</i></span><span class="s5">Emphasize that you&#8217;ll work with them on revising their project scope to fit the budget. Set limits on how much time you&#8217;ll invest for free without a commitment.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can I get a discount?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Here it&#8217;s usually best to stand behind your work, and emphasize that you&#8217;ve already made your bid as competitive as possible. But make sure this is the truth! It&#8217;s always best to start with a competitive bid than with a high or low estimate or other sales gimmick. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Explain the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you send the contract, let the homeowner know what to expect beforehand.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Will you send a digital contract or paper one? </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li><span class="s3"><em>Pro Tip: Most clients prefer digital documentation. Use Sweeten&#8217;s e-signature feature to get contracts signed faster. </em></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Tell the homeowner that you’re comfortable with answering their questions about your contract.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you use a standard boilerplate contract, send it with your estimate—don’t wait for the client to beg!</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you include your contract with the estimate, be sure to remind the client that it’s there.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Always include a time limit in your contract— &#8220;This estimate is good for 60 days,&#8221; etc. Make sure the client understands this. This speeds the process along, and protects you from a client showing up years later expecting the same deal.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1">Knowing how to close projects with clients takes practice and care. <span class="s1">Always think about what you can do to inspire confidence and trust. Taking the lead, being open and honest, transparent in your communications, and clearly explaining your contract will all help you win the client’s trust—and win the job.</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="sage-green-yellow-shower-wall-tiles"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51003" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with sage green square tiles on two walls and yellow tile on an other wall and black shower fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs just build, others run full-service design-build firms with architects and interior designers on staff, while the rest fall somewhere in between. If you can communicate exactly what you offer, you’ll be able to use design and materials services as selling points—and get paid fairly for them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider your unique offerings. For your clients, do you&#8230;</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make recommendations on materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curate and present a shortlist of materials options?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Introduce them to trusted vendors and arrange for trade discounts?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Take them shopping for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Play any role in ordering, paying, receiving, storing, QCing, or handling logistics for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Create 3D renderings or visualizations?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Design or fabricate anything for a custom installation?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you do any of the above, remember that this is real work—and it adds value for your clients. You should get paid a fair price for it! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communicate and educate</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with many aspects of renovating, the first step to success is communication. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Educate your clients</a> as early and clearly as possible. Many homeowners are new to renovation and do not realize that these services exist, or that they have real value. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You never want to lose a job because you’ve been outbid by another contractor who doesn’t offer the services the client needs. You’ll miss the business, and the homeowner will discover the cost of making uninformed choices—possibly when a pallet of materials they don’t like or don’t have space for lands at their front door. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro Tips</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your offerings</b><br />
Think about all your design and materials services. Write them down and get comfortable explaining them.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your prices</b><br />
Calculate how much time you put into these services, and put a price on them. Set limits (e.g., “The bid includes spending up to 1 hour with you at the tile store. Time beyond that we’ll bill at $100/hr.”)<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Use your services as selling points</b><br />
Discuss your design and materials services when selling your firm to prospective clients. This will differentiate your company, and will allow you to bill a fair price for the work.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Discuss process along with value</b><br />
Make sure your clients <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-juggle-contracting-jobs-and-keep-clients-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know what to expect</a>. A client educated in your process will have realistic expectations. They’ll more likely trust your expertise, be easier to work with and be happy with the outcome.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have any questions about selling your design and materials services, call or email your Sweeten account manager any time. We’re here to help!</span></p>

<h3>How to pay your general contractor during a renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/pay-safely-for-home-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Secure Pay</a></span><span class="s2"> lets you pay your home renovation deposit digitally, right from your Sweeten dashboard. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Until now, many contractors only accepted cash or paper checks, with all the associated inconveniences and delays—and complete lack of protections. Hiring and materials purchases would often be delayed until the check cleared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten Secure pay links to your bank account or credit card. It lets your contractor know immediately when funds are on the way, and completes the transfer in 1–2 business days.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s2">Benefits of Secure Pay:</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2">Pay for home renovations safely, with confidence. Transfers are handled by our trusted banking partners, Dwolla and Stripe—leaders in the financial industry. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay by credit card or bank transfer (ACH) </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Pay easily, right from your Sweeten dashboard </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Payments clear in 1–2 business days; your contractor sees instantly that funds are on the way. You can quickly make your hire official, and secure your place on the contractor’s calendar. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Your banking information stays private. Sweeten and your contractor can’t see or store any financial information. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></span></h3>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075677893"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Why is Sweeten Secure Pay better than writing a check?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You get the convenience of paying for home renovations digitally and responding directly to your contractor’s deposit request. You&#8217;ll avoid delays, and can secure your place on the contractor’s schedule as quickly as possible. Receive a permanent record of your transaction alongside your other renovation information. And if you pay by credit card, you get all your card company’s perks.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075732129"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do all Sweeten general contractors accept deposits through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Sweeten Secure Pay is new; general contractors will have to set up their accounts before they can receive funds. Ask your contractor if they’re ready to receive Secure Pay deposits.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075768647"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I sign up?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Go to the Secure Pay tab on your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/login/renovator">dashboard</a> and follow the simple instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075792347"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I know when or how much to pay?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Your general contractor will send a deposit request, which will appear in your Sweeten dashboard. It should match what you and the contractor have already agreed on. If you have questions about the deposit request, you’ll have as much time as you need to discuss with your contractor. No funds will transfer until you explicitly approve the payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075823777"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How will my bank account and personal information be protected?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Sweeten and your general contractor will never see your account information or social security number. We work with industry-leading 3rd party payment systems that are built around security and privacy. They use strong, end-to-end encryption for all transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637075836164"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I have to keep funds in my Sweeten Payments account?</strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">No. We transfer the funds directly from your bank or credit card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Adding your change order policy in a contract—while simply being upfront with the client—make a huge impact</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg" alt="Image of a room mid-construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors know that most renovation jobs and budgets get modified along the way. This happens either by last-minute client choices or by forces outside everyone’s control. But your clients may not know this—they’re probably not prepared for new expenses appearing after the job’s begun. </span><span class="s1">The solution: prepare clients by discussing change orders! Here, Sweeten offers 5 suggestions on how to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">1. Bring up change orders early </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Start the conversation during the hiring process. Don’t try to slip it in after they’ve signed the contract. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Have a clear and consistent change order policy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have to know every detail of your policy before you can discuss it with clients effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Communicate openly, honestly, and confidently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be afraid of scaring the client! They’re looking to you as the expert who will guide them through the process. Expert contractors will talk to their clients about <em>everything,</em> from <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation timelines</a> to change orders. By guiding them honestly and confidently, you’ll earn their trust. Plus, you’ll get to work with a well-informed client who has reasonable expectations.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Include your policy for change orders in the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This should be in addition to a discussion, not in place of it. Make sure you’re just as open and honest when you put your policies in writing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Be especially clear with clients who are purchasing their own materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impress upon them the significance of last-minute changes or delivery delays. Explain that what looks to them like a minor change in materials could actually mean hiring a more expensive subcontractor. And it may throw off the whole schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that most problems with clients come from broken expectations. The most valuable tool in your toolbox is good communication—it’s how you create trust and reasonable expectations before the work begins.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten supports many different types of vetted general contractors and firms, ranging in size and specialty</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final.jpg" alt="Sweeten types of GCs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GCCover-Graphic-Type-final-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wide range of general contracting firms work with Sweeten—just about anyone with a proven record of excellent home renovations in one of our service areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few ways we look at different types of general contractors and contracting firms, and the benefits Sweeten offers each of them.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Size of the General Contracting Firm</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emerging firms </b></span><span class="s1">are typically small firms that are still working to establish their presence and build a renovation portfolio. Sweeten works with general contracting firms that have been in business for at least six months. In addition to the Sweeten resources that help other small firms, emerging firms benefit from Sweeten’s free project photography, and our $15K minimum budget. Both help you build your portfolio and move from handyman tasks to the kinds of jobs you want. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Small established firms, </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with five or fewer employees, include sole proprietorships and family-run teams. These firms, while small, have specializations and are looking for specific types of projects. You may have limited resources for <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/lead-generation-for-contractors-to-generate-business-and-turn-a-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing and finding new, appropriate leads</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten offers services to help small, but established firms grow and thrive. These include a dedicated account manager, who will feel like a new team member devoted to marketing and business development. Equally important is Sweeten’s strict vetting of all leads, to make sure you’ll waste less time chasing jobs that go nowhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Large and established firms</b>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with over five employees, typically devote more resources to managing work volume. Sweeten offers large, established firms a full-featured <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard to track leads and projects</a>. Multiple team members can be given access to the dashboard. You’ll have full control over lead flow—pausing your account, restarting it, opening up to a wider variety of job types or budgets to land some quick work, or narrowing your focus to slow the flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also benefit from our high project values (2020 average was $67,000), and our lead vetting—we protect your time and resources from clients with the wrong kinds of jobs, or unrealistic budget expectations.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of General Contracting Firms</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Build-only firms</b> work from plans drawn by an outside designer or architect, or they handle basic rip-and-replace jobs. When Sweeten qualifies a project, we ask what kinds of services the client needs. We’ll give you all the important information, including if they’re already working with a designer or architect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Design-build firms</b> offer full design services, either by having designers or architects on staff or by having a partnership with outside professionals. When Sweeten determines that a client will need your full services, we prepare them for the associated budget increase.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Everything in between</b>. We work with general contracting firms that offer a wide range of design services, from basic advice on fixtures and finishes to making architect/designer referrals. We will learn your about services and your job preferences and will send you the most appropriate leads with appropriate budgets.   </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing Capacity</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms with a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you an even greater exposure, with opportunities for features on our blog and in the press (<em>Architectural Digest</em>, <em>The Today Show</em>, and other major outlets) which would otherwise be out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms without a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you a free start—you get all the marketing benefits of the platform, and only pay when you win a job. And you’ll get the benefits of all our pre-qualified leads, along with our sophisticated digital ad campaigns that target only the right homeowners.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What kind of firm is yours? How can Sweeten help you win?</span></strong></p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077282363"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I get my deposit through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll send a deposit request, straight from your Sweeten dashboard. The client will get an alert to review the request. It’s just one step for them to approve payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077296728"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How long will it take to get paid?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll get notified immediately when your client has approved payment. This lets you know funds are on the way. Funds will be available in your bank account in 1–2 business days.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077312433"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are there any fees for using Secure Pay? What about credit card fees?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You pay no transaction fees, even on credit card payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077332269"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I know when the client has paid?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll get a notification by email when the client approves a payment. You’ll also see payment status on your deposits dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077357578"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How is this faster than a paper check or cash?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">&#8211; Clients can respond much more quickly to your deposit request—they pay digitally, right from their Sweeten dashboard, with a few clicks. In addition to convenience, Secure Pay offers them the confidence of a trusted 3rd party payment network. They’re less likely to hesitate.<br />&#8211; Payments through Secure Pay clear faster than a check, and don’t require mailing or in-person delivery. <br />&#8211; As far as cash, homeowners are unlikely to keep enough under their mattresses! No one likes the danger and inconvenience—and the lack of financial protections—of procuring and delivering thousands of dollars in cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077370721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay give me a competitive advantage?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">71% of homeowners on our platform have said that they’d prefer to be able to pay digitally, directly through Sweeten’s platform. 78% said they’d prefer to pay by credit card. You’ll get badges on your profile showing that you take Secure Pay for credit cards and ACH, which will distinguish you from firms that don’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077405447"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay build trust with clients?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Homeowners are often afraid that contractors will run off with their money. Paying through a trusted 3rd party fosters confidence and peace of mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077422125"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Can I use Secure Pay to receive all renovation payments?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Right now it’s only available for deposits, to get you hired and started as quickly as possible. But we’re working on making it available for all payments. Stay tuned!</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077439580"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Secure Pay create additional steps in my process?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll be paid directly by the client. Sweeten saves you the headache of having to open up an account with a payment processor, negotiating a rate with them, and paying a fee for each transaction. By being a part of the Sweeten network, you get access to this free service.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077456948"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Do I need to have a signed contract before requesting a deposit?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, for now—you’ll need to upload a signed contract to Sweeten before you have access to Secure Pay. In an upcoming release, we’ll allow you to request deposits earlier, so you’ll have the flexibility to use the deposit as part of the contract signing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077476640"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does this work with Quickbooks?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">As long as the bank account linked to Secure Pay is the same account linked to Quickbooks, you’ll see deposits come through as you would any other ACH payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077498635"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Why should I trust the safety and privacy of Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Payments are handled by our trusted 3rd-party banking partners, Stripe and Dwolla. These are leaders in the financial industry, with rock-solid reputations for privacy and data security. Your transactions and financial information are protected by the highest level of end-to-end encryption. Sweeten cannot see or store any of your financial information.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077515270"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Sweeten’s fee get deducted automatically?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Absolutely not! You’ll continue to receive a separate invoice that you can pay by ACH or credit card within 30 days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How personal referrals, social media marketing, and typical lead-gen services stack up against working with Sweeten</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48001" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image.jpg" alt="Sweeten vs competitors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve got many options for finding leads. Each demands investing time and energy, and often cash. How do you choose? Of course, we&#8217;re biased—we’re pretty sure Sweeten is the best option for high-quality remodeling contractors. But it’s more than a casual opinion: we&#8217;ve sharing data to show how working with Sweeten benefits contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with a 2020 average over $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s why we think you’ll agree:</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Sweeten does the most thorough job of vetting leads. </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We weed out single-trade jobs and handyman tasks. We make sure the client’s budget fits the project scope. You tell us what kinds of jobs you want—your service area, your preferred project types, your budget range. We’ll only send you the right kinds of jobs. We only accept projects with budgets higher than $15,000 with rare exceptions. Our average job value for 2020 was $67,000. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We protect you from wasting time chasing dead-end leads. You won’t get this level of vetting from word-of-mouth referrals. You won’t get it from self-marketing on social media. You’ll get some of it from some lead-gen services—but you won’t get it all from any one of them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. With Sweeten, leads are free—you pay only when you win a job.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want you to win—because we only get paid when you get paid. We will never waste your time by filling your inbox with inappropriate leads. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You won’t get a win-win arrangement like this from social media marketing. You’ll get it from a couple of lead-gen services. Keep in mind that with social media, you pay for each click, no matter what happens next. Most lead-gen services sell the same leads simultaneously to many contractors—they maximize their income while maximizing your competition. They’re invested in keeping you paying, but not invested in your success. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. With Sweeten, you’ll be part of an elite network of highly vetted general contractors.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners will know you stand out from the crowd just by your Sweeten affiliation. They know that only 1 contractor out of 7 gets accepted into our network. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one else vouches for their contractors’ qualifications the way Sweeten does. All of our GCs have cleared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/"><span class="s2">multi-step vetting process</span></a> that includes license and insurance confirmation, portfolio reviews, a 30-minute live interview, and conversations with former clients. We tell our clients all about it! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Sweeten offers you a true partnership. We’re in it long-term to help you grow.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because of our win-win business model, we’re committed to your success.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We give you a dedicated account manager who helps with <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/the-renovation-sales-process-a-step-by-step-guide-for-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your marketing and business development</a> on the Sweeten platform. You’ll also have a dashboard that shows up-to-date performance statistics for your firm, offering valuable insights you can act on to win more jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You won’t get any of this from referrals, social media marketing, or other lead-gen services. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">6. Project photography</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There may be opportunities to take professional photography of your work and with the consent of the homeowner, the project can be featured on Sweeten’s blog. A link to your Sweeten profile will be included. At no cost to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one else offers this service.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">7. Content features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our award-winning blog has nearly a million visitors annually. There may be opportunities to be quoted in some of Sweeten’s Reno 101 blog post topics or having an introductory post dedicated to you so homeowners can read more about you and your work. A link to your Sweeten profile will be included—at no cost to you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one else offers a multiple award-winning blog with as impressive a readership as Sweeten.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten vs. Other Options</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48459 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SweetenVs.OtherOption-1.png" alt="Sweeten competitors" width="1000" height="950" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SweetenVs.OtherOption-1.png 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SweetenVs.OtherOption-1-300x285.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SweetenVs.OtherOption-1-600x570.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
