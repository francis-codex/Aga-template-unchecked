<h3>Time for a place with no roommates</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I moved to New York in 2007 after graduating college and settled in Hell’s Kitchen because of its relative affordability and proximity to the subway. For the first nine years, I lived in a large cookie-cutter rental building with two roommates, and first started looking into buying about three years ago. There were two motivating factors behind my search: The first was that I felt it was time to have my own place. I had lived with roommates since I was 18, and it was a great way to save money on the margin, but I was ready for a change. I had always thought that owning my own place in New York would be a proud moment and an important milestone in my life. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40507 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04.jpg" alt="studio floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second reason was financial, as I had seen our rent increase over $1,500 in my time there. That was a tough pill to swallow, but at least manageable when splitting it with a roommate. I didn’t want to put myself in that position if I lived alone, however. I had saved enough money over time <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to cover a down payment</a> and soon found myself checking the real estate websites on a daily basis to find the “perfect” apartment.</span></p>

<h3>A one-bedroom with a lot of light</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My two main requirements were that the apartment had one bedroom and good light. I also wanted to stay in Hell’s Kitchen so that I could still walk to work. But I quickly realized that there was no such thing as a “perfect” one-bedroom apartment in my price range, and anything that was close to what I wanted would go into contract within days of the initial listing. Competition was stiff. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, one day, after a year or so of looking, I decided to look more seriously at alcove studios with the idea of putting up a wall to create a one bedroom. I ended up finding a studio that was listed as a “junior one bedroom” on the top floor of a 1930s co-op in Hell’s Kitchen/Clinton. The kitchen and bathroom were a bit dated,  but that was less of a priority for me. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to look as good as it does.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More importantly, the current owner had already set up a large built-in bookcase to separate the bed area from the general living space—so you couldn’t even see the bed—and there were windows on both sides—two large ones facing north with trees offering privacy into the interior space and three large windows facing east toward my neighbor’s apartment. This was the exact studio layout I needed for my conversion into a true one bedroom.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40505 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40515 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07.jpg" alt="breakfast bar" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Junior one-bedroom remodel takes longer than expected</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The original timeline was four to five weeks, but the project ended up taking eight weeks to complete. (A heads-up to first-time renovators: It does cost more and takes longer than you expect. It’s New York City, after all, so you need to account for this variability). In my case, part of the extended timeline was due to Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My contractor helped in two ways though—one strategic and one tactical. First, it’s important to have the support of the co-op or building super for a renovation, and my contractor ensured that all of the co-op building work rules were met. Second, I would leave “to-do” lists each night toward the end of the renovation outlining items that I wanted to be addressed. I would then return the following day with each having been taken care of.</span></p>

<h3>Maximizing the layout of a cramped kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Updating the kitchen was a big part of the reno (and a big portion of the budget). The existing galley kitchen was from the 1980s and extremely small with little usable counter space. We maximized the layout so that it flowed better and felt less cramped. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The location of the stove and refrigerator were swapped. It not only provided more functional surfaces but we added an additional 14-inch ledge of counter space by the window. It had the effect of creating a wraparound spot where I could fit a stool and use it as a small breakfast bar. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40517 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg" alt="penny tile backsplash" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Light colors welcome a gleaming shine</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the kitchen is still small—about 60 square feet—I kept the colors very light. I chose white shaker cabinets with brushed nickel pulls, stainless steel appliances, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-maintenance Caeserstone-type quartz</a> (spilled red wine and coffee won&#8217;t stain). The counter material has modest strains of gray, gold, and brown, and complement the blueish-gray penny tile for the backsplash. The large gray floor tile helps elongate the small space. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was excited (and partially anxious) to see the various parts come together as a cohesive final product. I only had an idea of how everything would work together. The wall is fantastic and looks like it was always there. My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn’t expect it to look as good as it does.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg" alt="junior one bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">It was important that the new full bedroom design maintain the apartment’s natural light. It also needed to be large enough to fit a queen-size bed comfortably and allow me to walk around without any issues. My goal was to have a real wall creating two separate rooms and not look like a temporary or flex wall. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg" alt="bedroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40514 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06.jpg" alt="A modern junior one bedroom renovation with pocket door" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that I’ve finished my renovation, I suggest letting your design-build team know upfront what your priority is. For example, I was less focused on the timeline as long as the work was done correctly. And ask questions! Communication is critical and you don’t want to assume anything. </span></p>
<h3>Living in his junior one-bedroom during renovations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I actually chose to live in my apartment throughout the renovation process. The only night I did not stay was the first day of demolition. I would not recommend this for everyone though. I was largely motivated to put the money I saved, from not renting a place for 1-2 months, back into the renovation. (I had originally thought my budget would be enough for a kitchen, bathroom, and wall; however, I had to remove the bathroom from the scope upfront.) My contractor was very accommodating as this was likely a nuisance for him to clear a path for me to walk in and out to my bed every day. It was clear to me throughout the renovation process that my design-build team wanted me to be happy with the finished product. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wasn’t able to find the perfect one-bedroom at first, and I learned that nothing will be perfect, but I am extremely satisfied with the end result while staying within budget. Now, I’m proud to call the apartment my home and, even though I set out to live alone, my next plan is to adopt a dog or cat.</span></p>

<h3>Renovation FAQ</h3>
<h4><span>What is a junior one-bedroom apartment?</span></h4>
<p><span>A junior one-bedroom apartment is a studio apartment that has a partial wall that blocks off an area of the apartment. This allows for the apartment to be compartmentalized and helps create a more organized layout. A junior one-bedroom apartment can be an affordable option for someone looking to live on their own and who wants a studio with additional privacy.</span></p>
<h4>How to remodel a junior one-bedroom apartment</h4>
<p><span>Looking to renovate your junior one-bedroom apartment while keeping costs down? A recommended approach is to convert a junior one-bedroom apartment into a true one-bedroom apartment layout. Because junior one-bedrooms have partial walls, the walls show where the room can be created and closed off by completing the wall line. Additionally, simply closing off the wall allows for fewer structural changes overall, or the need to rethink the entire apartment layout. </span></p>

<h3>Change in scenery</h3>
<p>Hudson Heights is a veritable small town in the big city. Chris and I moved to the neighborhood from the Upper West Side when we started our family. We stumbled across it after a bike ride up the west side bike path to the Cloisters, and it felt like no other neighborhood in the city—quiet, beautiful, on top of a hill overlooking the Hudson River, yet it still had everything that makes New York City such a special and diverse place to live. And the housing market offered more space for our money, so that was also appealing.</p>

<p>We bought a one-bedroom apartment, had three children, and found a home in this amazing neighborhood and community. Fast forward to nine years later, and Chris was offered a position in the California Bay Area. We were incredibly sad to leave Hudson Heights, but we had outgrown our one-bedroom apartment and knew a change was inevitable.</p>
<h3>Back to the beginning</h3>
<p>We spent two wonderful, adventure-filled years in California, but our old neighborhood, city, and home in New York City were always calling us back. When an opportunity came up for Chris to move to a team here, we knew it was meant to be. We immediately started looking for a home in Hudson Heights, and after many months of searching, the listing for this apartment appeared. It was the perfect space for our family. After so many years of uncertainty and bouncing around, we finally felt like we found a home to settle down in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40958 size-full" title="open kitchen and dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg" alt="open kitchen and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment—a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath co-op in a post-war, 1950s building—was all in its original condition, except for a replaced refrigerator. Even the metal cabinets stuck together with paint and the linoleum kitchen floors were still intact. Thankfully, our budget allowed us to factor in a renovation, but we had never done anything like this before, not even in the old one-bedroom that we owned. Just thinking about being able to make a home specific to our taste and design was so exciting.</p>
<h3>Scoping out work for the renovation</h3>
<p>We wanted to update everything. Our hope was for a bright and airy home that looked modern and clean. I spent many late nights scouring <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>, so we knew what we liked and had an idea of ways to achieve that using certain colors, materials, and furniture, but we were still completely overwhelmed with choices of materials, where to get them, and how to stay within our budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40960 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A floor to match the aesthetic</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten design-build team guided us through all of that, suggesting brands, vendors, and materials to achieve our overall look. Thinking about our budget, I was definitely on the fence about where to spend and where to save, and I even waffled on whether we should get new floors. I thought the parquet floors held up well enough and still looked beautiful, but since we were going for a different modern look, we decided to redo the floors. I have to say, I am so glad we did because it completely changed the whole feel of the space.</p>

<h3>Letting the design-team lead</h3>
<p>Overall, our design-build team was awesome. When we met, they were professional, listened to and understood our vision, and also offered wonderful ideas we hadn’t thought of. It felt like their excitement for the project was mutual. And as we were first-time renovators, they were so great and helpful walking us through each step. They were constantly offering suggestions telling us what works and what doesn’t, always steering us in the right direction. <span style="color: #333333;">Our biggest question was, “Would you please hold our hand throughout this whole process because we do not know what the heck we are doing!”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40962 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40966 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Shifting the floor plan</h3>
<p>The kitchen needed the most improvement. In our previous homes, we always had wall-facing counters or a separate kitchen away from the living space, so entertaining was always a challenge or just had a difficult flow. With that in mind, we decided to partially open up the existing kitchen wall to create a two-sided counter with an area for stools on the other side where the kids or guests can sit.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40959 size-full" title="kitchen peninsula " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen peninsula " width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>We also shifted the floor plan a little, pushing out the wall between the kitchen and the living room to widen the galley. We told our design-build team our vision, and they helped us figure out the best way to do that given the space and structure of the apartment.</p>
<h3>Versatility in the kitchen</h3>
<p>It is now so much easier when the kids want to help us in the kitchen. There is definitely a lot less pushing and arguing for space and for who gets to sit on a random chair we used to pull up to the counter. <span style="color: #333333;">Pancake mornings are more zen now that everyone has their own stool to sit on to help.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40968 size-full" title="kitchen sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen sink" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40964 mb-0 size-full" title="desk niche" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg" alt="desk niche" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>I think if you asked Chris what he was the most excited about, it would be the built-in desk and cabinet space. We were able to work with our design-build team to create an organized drawer and cabinet system for our work and creative space, as well as a system for the constant flow of kids’ schoolwork, art supplies, and collections.</p>
<h3>A modern update</h3>
<p>In the dining room, we got a new light fixture for over the table, but we saved the original 1950s art deco chandelier that had hung over the original dining area and decided to shine it up and use it as a fixture in the girls&#8217; bedroom. They love it and it definitely makes for a fancy splash of fun in that room.</p>

<h3>A bathroom that fits just right</h3>
<p>For the bathroom, which is tiny, we had a barn door put on instead of having a door that opens into the bathroom, making the space even tighter.</p>

<h3>More room, more convenient</h3>
<p>Our design-build team also suggested the double doors for closets throughout the apartment in place of a single door. Our son plays the drums so having a wider entry opening was helpful. The double doors took up the least amount of space when opened and allowed for more wiggle room with our furniture. It made a world of difference.</p>

<h3>Plan for the &#8216;just-in-case&#8217;</h3>
<p>With any major project like this one, there will always be hiccups. Whether it be with the schedule, or with finding pipes in the wall you didn’t know were there, or with materials that you did not account for in the budget. Our advice to future renovators: Plan accordingly, but also maybe plan for &#8220;just-in-case.&#8221; Give yourself a buffer for scheduling and for budget, if you are able. It will most likely be needed.</p>
<p>We certainly needed it. We were renting elsewhere on a one-year lease, and when we bought the unit, we only had a few months left to go on our lease. So we were eager to get the ball rolling. The contractors gave us a clear schedule that aligned with the end of our lease, perfectly. There were some unforeseen hiccups around approvals and it could have taken much longer if it weren’t for our contractor and design team always going to bat for us and making necessary calls and contacting the powers that be to make sure things moved along at a faster pace.</p>

<h3>Working with remodeling hiccups</h3>
<p>Because of slow approvals, the schedule did get pushed back a few weeks. Our time renting had ended and we had to be out. But the project was still very much in the throes of construction, so we ended up staying at an extended-stay suite in the neighborhood directly across the bridge from us in New Jersey! We were carpooling back and forth over the George Washington Bridge for work and school—a traffic nightmare. Our contractor was very understanding and sympathetic to our needs, so he doubled his team and had everyone finishing up the place at top speed. And even if my kids did appreciate the free cookies at the hotel counter every day, we were thrilled to finally be in our finished apartment after a week in the hotel.</p>
<p>Looking back on it all, our newly renovated home makes us feel super grateful—grateful for having the ability to make the changes we wanted and grateful we found such a great team to help and make those changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple renovates for city living with a touch of Paris</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Suburban life isn’t for everyone. That’s, at least, the conclusion one couple arrived at when they decided to trade life in the ‘burbs for a 1,100-square-foot prewar co-op on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. But their new home was hardly turnkey. With a previous reno under their belt and an eye for the apartment&#8217;s potential, the homeowners <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, eventually <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring a design-build firm</a> to see their vision through. The result: A Paris-inspired apartment with clean, modern elements and a hint of traditional style.</i></span></p>

<p>All great things in life take time. And while the decor of our apartment is still a work in progress, renovating it all happened on time with no issues. That’s a major feat given the number of updates we were looking to make.</p>
<p><span class="s1">We previously tried living in the suburbs and realized it just wasn’t for us. So we decided on the Upper West Side and then rented in the neighborhood while we looked for a place. When we found this apartment—a prewar co-op built in 1929 with original beams—we knew it would need a full renovation. </span>We saw a lot of space potential but really wanted to maximize it for our needs. The apartment was just old and uncared for.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, we had some renovation experience under our belt, having done a smaller one at our home in the suburbs, but renovating in the city is a whole different ball game. </span></p>

<p>When we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten, they matched us with a design-build firm and after our initial interview, we knew we really liked them. But what ultimately sealed the deal for us was hearing feedback on this firm from Sweeten. That input added confidence to our decision.</p>

One of the major space-maximizing updates we made was to change the layout of the rooms by separating the original large living room into two separate spaces—an office that could turn into a third bedroom in the future—and converting one of the bedrooms into an open living area. We now have a living room with French doors that open up into the office.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our overall vision for the design was inspired by a Paris apartment. Although we knew we didn’t have the right format apartment for that, we wanted to combine clean modern elements (like our kitchen) with some traditional touches, like crystal chandeliers. </span></p>

<p>For starters, the kitchen was a disaster. It felt like it was last renovated in the ‘70s. Everything was old and falling apart, the space was poorly used, and the floors were covered in an ugly blue tile. We always knew we wanted very dark floors and a clean, white minimalist kitchen with matching countertops and backsplash. We also thought that installing wood floors in the kitchen to match the rest of the apartment would help make the space look slightly larger and not cut off from the other rooms.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57090 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-16.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Because of all the gear, our contractor suggested we add a smaller closet in an additional room which we didn’t realize we’d need at the start of the renovation.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57086 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with marble counters and backsplash" width="1000" height="1503" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The kitchen itself is a standard New York City galley and maximizing the space was important to us. To do so, we hoped to have the cabinets installed all the way up the ceiling, turning every possible square inch into a useful space. We also wanted to fit in a large refrigerator, a dishwasher, washer/dryer unit, and a water filtration system.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57088 size-full" title="kitchen sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Stainless steel kitchen sink" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>What we were trying to accomplish in the kitchen and bathrooms was a clean, modern white look that would serve as a point of contrast to the more traditional look of the rest of the apartment. In the kitchen, that meant minimizing the use of hardware with push-open cabinets, a paneled fridge and dishwasher, and a hidden washer and dryer inside one of the cabinets. We are very happy with the number of cabinets we got in the end. Smart additions like a spice rack help with organizing pantry items.</p>

<p>All of that was a lot to ask, but there was more. The bathroom was another disaster. It had a walk-in shower installed for universal design that we didn&#8217;t need and that took up so much space. The old sink was huge and didn’t provide any storage, and overall, the space lacked the modern look we were after.</p>

<p>We used large marble-look tiles from the floor to the ceiling to visually enlarge the space. A glass shower enclosure kept the look nice and clean and avoided the heavy look of a shower curtain. We also added a floating cabinet for more storage under the sink and a built-in mirror with extra lighting. It ended up looking beautiful!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57083 " title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-09.jpg" alt="White and gray bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-color="" data-overlay-text="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/23838-Liya-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A second, smaller bathroom that was previously used as a storage room was another challenge. We were able to maximize space fitting it with a proper toilet and a small sink with a similar floating cabinet. The same floor-to-ceiling tile trick—this time in a stone color—opens up the room quite a bit.</p>

<p><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had a very high level of service and gave us great advice throughout the process. </span>One of the best suggestions they made was to build a large closet space (bigger than we thought we needed) in the hallway, and he was right. Our original thought was to make a narrow closet that would just fit coats, but we’ve found ourselves using every inch of that space to the max, not just for coats and shoes. The smart design of the closet allows us to fit storage baskets, along with various other items like suitcases and lifestyle gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZViC8qWml4U&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40877 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/QA-AltAgreement-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Because of all the gear, our contractor also suggested we add a smaller closet in an additional room which we didn’t realize we’d need at the start of the renovation. Without the advice of our contractor, we would have made a mistake. Their experience and ability to see our vision allowed them to create exactly what we needed.</p>

<p>The biggest hurdle was getting the approvals needed for each part of the project like adding a bathroom into our master bedroom. (We ultimately had to settle on a smaller space due to some approval issues.)</p>

<p>Now that we’re reno pros to a degree, there are a few things we’d suggest for those looking to take on a project like ours: First, choose your contractors carefully. We spent time and effort to research the best options, and it paid off. We also like financial visibility in our contract—a fixed price and no surprises. And lastly, don’t try to live in the apartment while doing a full gut reno.</p>
<p>Once the reno was done, we were left with this blank canvas we love with its dark floors, white walls, beamed ceilings, and a modern clean kitchen. We want to host people all the time and never leave home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>For its 100th birthday, two sisters give their family home a top-to-bottom refresh</h2>
<p><em>In some ways, nothing has changed at the Jamaica, New York house that sisters Gayle, Merri, and their family have called home for 50 years. But while the bones of the home, like the family that lived there, have remained the same, most of what meets the eye has changed. Calling on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, Gayle, a freelance brand strategist, and Merri, a corporate accountant, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a general contractor</a> to bring all 1,200 square feet of the two-story, traditional-style house up to date. And they did it just in time to commemorate its 100th birthday.</em></p>

<p>Ripping out the dark brown paneling and the shag carpeting of our family’s detached home in Jamaica, a working-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, couldn’t have come soon enough. Our parents bought the home in 1970 and our family has lived in it continuously since then. I’ve been living in the home since 2012, Merri moved in in 2014, and we purchased the house from our mom, who had downsized to an apartment by then, in 2017.</p>

The space was functional, but it was a little worn, outdated, dark, and drafty.</p>
<p>Our main goals for the reno were to dispel the darkness throughout the house and to bring out the home’s original character, which had really been buried. On a purely functional level, we also wanted to make the house more comfortable by upgrading the interior insulation and making sure the electrical and plumbing were up to snuff.</p>
<p>The flooring throughout the house was another element that helped tie everything together. After peeling back the old carpeting, we discovered that all of the original hardwood floors were in great shape for a house built in the 1920s, so we ended up just sanding and staining them dark walnut. Not having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay for new flooring</a> saved us a ton of money. We then installed walnut wood-look porcelain tile in the kitchen and bathroom to keep the look cohesive.</p>

<blockquote><p>[we found] a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between Merri and I, there must be dozens of books in the house. Part what we wanted in making over the house was one central place to keep them. I’ve always loved houses with libraries, so we designated one long wall in the dining room for the library, and bought a six-tier bookshelf to hold everything.</p>
<p>The dining room is located right off of the living room and off of that is an enclosed porch, which we turned into a mudroom. To section off the two spaces, we asked for a glass door, but there was a miscommunication with the contractor and an exterior door was installed instead. What we really wanted was a French door with multiple panes of glass from top to bottom. Our contractor quickly swapped it out for exactly what we wanted, but it was a lesson on how to be specific with requests!</p>

<p>But before we got to decorating, there was some renovating to be done. Our biggest challenge was getting the kitchen exactly right. We moved a corner sink to a new spot under the large window overlooking the backyard. We didn’t want to knock down walls or change the footprint of the kitchen, but we needed more storage. So we got cabinets that go all the way up to the ceiling and added a pantry, which had never been in the house before. We also added a ginormous refrigerator, a dishwasher, and we swapped out the microwave over the range for a freestanding hood. The sizes and layout of the upper and lower cabinets had to be precise to accommodate all of these additions without making the room look overstuffed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40780 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40781 mb-0 size-full" title="hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For the bathroom walls, we found 12” x 24” rectangular blocks of gray fabric-look tile. It’s very understated but luxe and looks like suit fabric. We stayed in a hotel that used this kind of tile and managed to track down a lookalike. Everyone thinks it’s wallpaper until they touch it.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, this was actually one of the biggest lessons we learned: Write your requests down! First, it helps you and whoever you may be renovating with (in this case, my sister) get on the same page. Merri and I have very different tastes and writing down what we wanted forced us to find common ground. The first day we met with our Sweeten contractor matches, we had a list ready for them to react to and this saved so much time. We were able to find out exactly how far our budget would stretch. The list also allowed our contractor to help us prioritize needs and wants. We kept revisiting it throughout the renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40783 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Prior to this, I personally hadn’t done more than paint a wall and put up shelves in my apartment, so the thought of a top to bottom house renovation was mildly terrifying. We were most worried about what was lurking behind the walls—the condition of the electrical and the plumbing. The house is almost 100 years old, so you’re never sure what you’re going to find.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw7gQyvamVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="reno-video-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40893 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>We did discover that two support beams were missing under the front entryway floor, which was why it sloped so bad. When our contractor called to tell me, he already had a solution to suggest and pricing ready, so we were able to easily make the correction without impacting the timeline. A good surprise, though, was finding a stained glass window behind paneling in the dining room that was removed. I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.</p>

<p>I never felt like I was out of the loop on what was going on with our contractor and his team. Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn’t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten Client Services contacts were also great with checking in weekly to see if everything was proceeding as planned. Three months after we started, the renovation was completed. My favorite part was experiencing how the atmosphere of the rooms transformed; I’d grown up here and everything was very clear in my mind, just the way my parents had it. The renovation actually made it feel like a completely new house. Now, it feels like a calm sanctuary. I just love how relaxed I instantly feel when I walk through the front door.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Sharing a one-bedroom, postwar condo in Manhattan’s iconic Flatiron neighborhood feels like as much of a rite of passage into adulthood as it does into New York City life. Living on her own, Whitney, a finance associate, would find a new way to view the home she owned and a host of modern amenities in those same 800 square feet. But uncovering her apartment’s solo-living potential took some work, such as renovating the bathroom and kitchen and installing new flooring. Whitney <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a>  to</i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i> </i><span class="s3"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found a Sweeten design-build firm</a> to turn her starter unit into sophisticated living quarters for one.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Few people can say that they relish living with roommates, but moving from a sheltered college town right into the middle of Manhattan, I missed having friends and classmates around. So I decided to share my apartment—an 800-square-foot condo inside a postwar high-rise. The living arrangement brought familiarity as I adjusted to my post-graduation working life, and it really helped me feel more rooted. (I had been traveling and living abroad since elementary school.)</span></p>

I also knew that if I were to ever sell or rent my apartment out, I’d have to make some changes or give the space a facelift at the very least. This felt like a good time to just go for it, so I decided to renovate the entire place and enjoy living on my own for a little while.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39540 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="s1">To backtrack a bit, the apartment hadn’t been remodeled since the ‘90s, which means a lot of the finishes were dated. (Parquet floors are nice, they’re just not my style.) And when I shared the space with a roommate, I wasn’t into many of the design details or really even taking great care of the place. The apartment just didn&#8217;t speak to either of us, in all honesty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once I decided to live alone, however, I wanted something that I not only cared about, but that reflected who I am. It also needed to reflect the current decade and be functional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first thing I did before starting the renovation was to load up on inspiration and visit open houses in my building and neighborhood. That’s where I got the idea to install floor-to-ceiling doors throughout the apartment, which really draw the eyes up and accentuate the high ceilings throughout the building. The entry door to the apartment was already floor-to-ceiling, so this really helped unify the look and make it more consistent.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aesthetically-speaking, I had a strong point of view on what the newly renovated space would look like. I knew I wanted a black-and-white color palette throughout and that I have a soft spot for dramatic silhouettes and proportions with artwork hanging and leaning against the walls. This is where hiring a construction pro really helped because my vision wasn’t always practical or realistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, I was knob-averse for the longest time, meaning I didn’t want to have handles or knobs on my cabinet doors out of fear that they would break up the modern, minimalist look of the </span><span class="s5">kitchen</span><span class="s1">—and the entire apartment for that matter. My Sweeten general contractor warned me repeatedly that there would be no way to open the doors. Despite that, I stuck to my decision until I moved back in and realized that there was actually no way to open my cabinets! Of course, they were right all along.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39537 size-full" title="white kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="s1">For the </span><span class="s5">kitchen</span><span class="s1">, I replaced all of the appliances, took out the walls (a half wall and the upper cabinets), and created an open, airy flow between the kitchen and dining area that really highlights the waterfall countertop and counter seating. I also refinished all of the AC units throughout the apartment so they’d blend more seamlessly into the walls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s5">bathroom</span><span class="s1"> got new fixtures as well, along with new tile in two different patterns of pale marble (a basketweave for the floor and subway tile for the walls). Installing a glass shower panel made it so I never have to deal with a moldy curtain ever again. It also opens up the space, which has no windows, so it <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks larger than it is</a>.</span></p>

It was a compromise for me that worked out in the end: I had more than enough storage space and I was able to maintain the streamlined look I was going for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using one color theme throughout the </span><span class="s5">apartment</span><span class="s1"> ultimately allowed me to flex my sense of humor in some places (see the Seletti Monkey Lamp), and take risks in other spots, such as the mirror-covered hallways, which was actually a nice mistake. </span><span class="s1">I had originally planned to have only one </span><span class="s5">wall mirrored</span><span class="s1"> as part of a dressing area. But due to a miscommunication, we ended up mirroring the entire hallway. The effect was quite stunning and brought in so much light and drama. It makes me feel like I’m on a runway when I walk through from the bedroom to the closets and bathroom while getting dressed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39541 mb-0 size-full" title="mirrored closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg" alt="mirrored closets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up swapping out the parquet flooring for wide wood planks and repainting everything black and white, including black window frames and matching shutters. </span><span class="s1">Keeping it classic sounds simple enough, but choosing the right shades of black and white, ones with just the right undertones for the lighting in my apartment proved tricky. I have a high-floor, north-facing unit, and things look much cooler when the northern light and blue-ish sky comes streaming in. This meant I had to pick shades with a bit more warmth in tone and matte in their finish.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39731 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09.jpg" alt="bedside table" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It was the same deal with the floors. Though I’d set out to get really light wood flooring, I went with a shade that looked substantially darker in the showroom. The result? This beautiful pale neutral wood that, once installed and illuminated under the natural light, ended up being just what I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before I started the project, I was consumed with all of the choices I’d have to make between what I wanted design-wise and the things that would enhance the value of the apartment. I was lucky to be able to navigate and negotiate those decisions with the help of my general contractor.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04.jpg" alt="wall with portraits" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-WhitneySheng-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My Sweeten contractor was also there to help me nail down decisions that would ultimately enhance the value of my apartment. Coming from a non-technical background, it was sometimes hard to convey my design ideas, but he made sure to align the technical aspects of the project with my aesthetic, he was quick to respond and follow up, and he was not afraid to be creative, take risks, and persist until things were done right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From one first-time renovator to another, I think it pays to plan ahead and have a full vision before bringing other team members on. </span><span class="s1">In the end, the design process ended up being my favorite part of the renovation. It was a practical exercise in working within a timeframe and budget— which were my two biggest concerns at the start of the project—and it’s been rewarding to see my vision come through.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After years of traveling, living in foreign countries and cities, it means the world to me to have my own space in a city I identify with.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Decades after its last reno, a prewar condo takes on a new life</h2>
<p><em>Finding the perfect apartment for one can be a challenge in New York City, let alone for a growing family that includes a 2.5-year-old, a 2-month-old, and pet, Maggie. Sometimes it takes pure luck to hit the real estate jackpot, other times, as in the case of lawyers Katherine and Chris, it takes vision. The couple’s dream home—a three-bedroom apartment in Park Slope—didn’t turn up fully renovated and as reasonably priced as they’d hoped. Instead, they landed on a two-bedroom, formerly rent-controlled unit and got creative with the design. To help see their vision through, Katherine and Chris called on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, eventually hiring a design-build firm to turn the apartment’s existing kitchen into a master bedroom, gut renovate the bath, and create the family home they’d been looking for.</em></p>

<p>A 1.5-bedroom walk-up on the Upper East Side has its charms no doubt, but before the birth of our second child, the need for more space (and fewer stairs!) loomed. We had been looking in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn because one of the zoned elementary schools in the area is excellent. Chris’ parents also live in south Brooklyn and are very helpful with the kids, which was added incentive for our search. The problem is that when you’re searching in a desirable neighborhood with a desirable elementary school, good, fully-renovated three-bedroom apartments are hard to come by. And when they do crop up, they’re pretty expensive.</p>

Although it was a two-bedroom, we immediately recognized a floor plan that we could reconfigure to get the three bedrooms we needed.</p>
<p>When we checked it out, we learned that since the apartment is on the first floor and it wouldn’t disturb the upper units, we could likely move the kitchen plumbing from the back of the apartment to the front, creating an open living room-kitchen space up front and converting the former kitchen into our master bedroom. Plus, our estimated construction costs seemed doable.</p>

Essentially, the purchase price and renovation costs needed to add up to the approximate market value of a renovated three-bedroom in the area.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pantry was also our contractor&#8217;s idea; I didn’t even know that pull-out pantries existed and wasn’t sure we’d have space. But it works perfectly&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The layout of the apartment was one thing, but there was a lot more work to be done beyond that. The apartment hadn’t been renovated in at least 30 years. The floors were warped from water damage, the hallway flooring was covered in industrial carpeting, and the kitchen floors were old linoleum. The kitchen had a lowered ceiling with crumbling tile and stains from an old flood. The walls had dozens of coats of paint layered on and there were popcorn ceilings throughout the apartment.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, fixtures were rusted, and the clawfoot tub was set up with the shower on the long wall of the tub rather than the short end. The closets and wiring also needed to be updated. Overall, we were looking for a bright, modern aesthetic but wanted to make sure that it didn’t feel cold or inconsistent with the prewar building style.</p>

Since we aren’t creative types, we definitely saw the value in hiring a firm that offered both building and design services, and we liked that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten general contractor we chose</a> not only fabricated their own cabinets but provided 3D designs so that we could visualize the finished project. That really allowed us to participate in the process.</p>
<p>Additionally, when negotiating the price and scope of the project, our contractor was very upfront with us. When we suggested certain measures that could cut costs, for example, they would tell us if they thought we would be displeased with the result, but would then suggest another area to cut costs that would be less noticeable in the finished project.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40142 size-full" title="look down a hallway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg" alt="kitchen and hallway" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-15-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Creating and maximizing space was another important consideration for us throughout the renovation, and that proved particularly challenging in the kitchen, where certain kinds of storage could have easily made the space feel cramped.</p>
<p>I felt strongly that we needed a coat closet in the living room to corral entryway clutter. Originally, I had large media units with built-in storage in mind, but our Sweeten contracting team suggested extending the kitchen cabinets instead, integrating the closet that way, which looks much better than a separate media unit. The pantry was also their idea; I didn’t even know that pull-out pantries existed and wasn’t sure we’d have space. But it works perfectly and allowed use of every inch of floor-to-ceiling space in the design. Now we can put things we don’t use much up top, as well as extra supplies.</p>

We decided to build cabinets and closets around the bed to save space, rather than putting the closets opposite the bed, which would have eaten up precious floor space.</p>

We moved the tub from the side to the back wall to save space and make room for extra cabinet storage. That move required us to change the plumbing to a degree because we used the former drain from the toilet for the tub. Since there was asbestos tile in the bathroom we would have had to do an abatement if we cut a new drain for the toilet. Instead, we decided to use a wall-hung toilet, which ended up looking very streamlined and saved space, so it was a win-win.</p>

That required us to set the tub about 10 inches out from the window. Our contractors used that space to build shelves for the shower, which ended up being a beautiful design element as well. Penny tile floors added a nice tactile touch and the marble tile gives the space a luxurious look.</p>

The contractors we chose were very honest and knowledgeable and ultimately tipped the scales in their favor to win the project.</p>
<p>In the end, they delivered a more beautiful apartment than we ever could have dreamed up ourselves. And on top of it, they got it done very quickly and were lovely to work with. I’d highly recommend them.</p>
