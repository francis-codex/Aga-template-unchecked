<li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> K.V. Harper posted her Brooklyn <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation</a> project on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where: </strong>Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in New York</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> A backyard renovation overhaul makes way for an urban getaway, including a raised deck</li>
<li><strong>With: </strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>

<h3>Planning out the backyard space</h3>
<p>K.V. received suggestions from friends, including calls for a pool, but found herself inspired by the gardens of Mexico and Brazil. She preferred lush retreats and welcoming <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor decks</a> for relaxation and fun. Hosting friends and barbecues was top of mind.</p>

<p>Her vision for cedar fencing became the focal point of the project. The Brooklyn <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation</a> was framed by horizontal cedar boards with areas to lounge and dine. The red perimeter incorporated natural clean lines.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor started by clearing the yard entirely. They pulled up everything until they reached fresh dirt, making way for a clean slate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="backyard-with-stained-cedar-fencing" class="alignnone wp-image-50617 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />After clearing and leveling the plot, he installed stained cedar fencing around the full yard. A lone mature tree in the far right corner of the yard was preserved. Her contractor discovered bluestone under the rubbish during demolition. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No two renovations</a> are the same. As a result, he suggested upcycling them as part of a pathway leading to an elevated oasis at the back filled with gravel. Post your project on Sweeten to see what creative backyard ideas you and your contractor can <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan together</a>. Here are some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard renovation costs</a> to take into consideration.</p>

<h3>Discovering the green thumb</h3>
<p>Although they used fresh sod sparingly, the yard’s midsection revealed a green, lush aesthetic. K.V. admitted that having grass was a lot of work. As a consequence, however, she acquired a green thumb, a better sense of gardening, and plans for increased plantings next year. A row of mulch ran along the left side of the fencing with annuals, perennials, and blooms. It made a great foundation for her newly acquired landscaping skills.</p>

The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/backyard-deck-goes-wall-to-wall-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elevated deck</a> included bright Acapulco chairs, a fire pit, and a hammock (which she considered tossing until she made peace with the fact that she spent most of her days relaxing here). A grill and dining area sit along the walkway.</p>
<p>With a completed backyard renovation in Brooklyn under her belt, K.V. is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready for outdoor living</a> in the city.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Historic brownstone, close to trains, and a (relatively) affordable neighborhood. These were our criteria when we selected Crown Heights as our new home. A few years ago, we had moved out of the city to Long Island, but immediately missed our friends and the shorter commute. Janet, who runs the New York School of Design, a fashion design school, wanted to have input on the layout and fittings of our new home. So we decided to limit our search to townhouses that needed a gut renovation. We only looked at listings which included the term “bring your architect”—you know the type.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After many open houses and a fierce bidding war, we were given the keys to a four-family brownstone that “had good bones” but needed a little TLC. During our initial walk-through as new homeowners, it suddenly hit us—the prospect of such a big renovation was really daunting! We used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matched us to our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architects</a>. Sweeten also suggested three different contractors who each made proposals. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our general contractor </a>and together, we got started.</p>
<p>The goal of our townhouse renovation was to create the perfect mix of old and new. We loved pre-war architecture and wanted to preserve as much of the original detail as possible. During this process, we worked with our architect to think of ways to match the original detail with newer materials. We wanted to rethink the apartment layouts and convert the two-bedroom units to large one bedrooms. In addition to updating the kitchens and baths, we hoped that an open layout would feel brighter and more spacious. Due to budget and timing, we decided to renovate the four apartments in two phases. At the time of this blog post, two apartments are finished. We are currently living in one of them and preparing to rent it out after the other units are complete.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39968" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the demo phase, a lot of time was spent assessing what could be restored and what needed to go. The contractor tried to salvage the original ceiling medallions, but they crumbled once the nearby popcorn ceilings were removed. In the kitchen, it was a pleasant surprise when we found excellent condition hardwood floor underneath the linoleum. We were elated when we discovered that the stairways were in great condition and could be refinished (apparently, new stairs are very expensive). It was a rough day when we found out that the main supporting beam for the building (wooden and over 100 years old) needed to be replaced with a steel beam—a big unforeseen expense. But we were thankful that the general contractor was meticulous and didn’t take any shortcuts in safety.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39972 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39976 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />After demo, we then installed new electrical, plumbing, and gas heating. Next came the framing of the walls to create the new floor plan. The layout is what really makes the apartment special. We joined the living room and an adjacent closet so that the entire area is larger. This created a small alcove, which is now a quiet sitting area bathed in natural light. The living room then flows into the kitchen and dining area. Eight-foot French doors separate the kitchen from the bedroom. The doors, even when closed, allow more light to flow into the apartment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The kitchen was very important to us. We like to cook, so we really wanted extra counter space and built-in butcher block. Gray cabinetry and shelving were arranged to maximize storage space, and we incorporated mixed-material countertops, as well as a sink, fridge, and dishwasher—all from IKEA. We chose a counter-depth refrigerator, which fit perfectly into </span>the space<span style="color: #333333;">. A geometric </span>tile<span style="color: #333333;"> backsplash brings it all together.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom is large enough for a king-size bed. We kept the existing wall between the kitchen and bedroom but converted the old kitchen into a dressing room. The dressing room is Janet&#8217;s favorite space. It has a huge closet, room for seating, and a full-sized washer and dryer. The bathroom has two entrances—one from the kitchen/dining area and a pocket door from the dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The window moldings and crowns are all original. We decided to paint them black to contrast with the lighter wall colors. All the doors are original and were reconditioned and adjusted to fit properly. We chose egg-shaped door knobs. Picture rail moldings and new ceiling medallions were added. In the hallways, we restored the original wainscoting and created new panels to fill in missing or damaged areas.</p>

<p>The bathroom was also designed to mix old and new. We chose a sink and toilet that would go well with the traditional fixtures. For added towel storage, we installed a separate rack. We chose to use elongated tiles, a twist on the traditional subway tiles. The matte texture of the hexagon floor tiles feels amazing on bare feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building exterior also underwent a facelift. We first removed the &#8217;70s screen door and awning. The exterior cornice was repainted black, allowing its architectural detail to shine. We chose a color called &#8220;Velvet Plum&#8221; for the main exterior. We splurged and replaced the front door with historically-accurate mahogany double doors. While this was not cheap, it’s one of our favorite things about the building.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All this sounds like a lot of work and it truly was. During the build-out phase, we had weekly walk-throughs with our architect and contractor. I realized that this was very important and ensured that the project progressed smoothly. Even though there were detailed architectural plans and specifications, there were often unforeseen circumstances that would require a quick decision. These meetings and open communication with the contractor helped avoid delays and insured that the build-out was to our liking. Because we watched as things were being done, we often gave last-minute input and even changed our minds about things a few times.</p>
<p>For those of you out there who are planning to do a similar project, I highly recommend that you be involved. I know it’s tempting to think, “Hey, I’m paying these people A LOT to do this for me and I just want to see the final result.” That’s understandable. But, although it’s time-consuming and a bit of a pain, I guarantee that you’ll get a better end result if you are involved in the process like we were. In addition, your choice of general contractor is extremely important. Since this was our first renovation, we had put a lot of trust in our team. We feel really fortunate that our contractor was honest and didn’t try to nickel and dime us on every little thing.</p>
<p>Looking back, we really didn’t know what we were getting into with such a big project (we blame cable TV renovation shows for misleading us). But, fortunately, with guidance from our architect and general contractor, the process ended up to be very positive. We absolutely love our new home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Closet and platform bed storage highlight an alcove studio</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we published Lauren&#8217;s studio renovation in October of 2016, we found ourselves obsessed with everything in it, from the thoughtful design to the clever storage sprinkled throughout. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones. <em>The New York Times</em> covered Lauren&#8217;s home shortly after, (see below) featuring her space in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Organized in a Tiny Apartment</a>, an article focused on living small—yet smart—in the big city. Since many of you have set the goal of getting organized once and for all, we thought it was time for another look at this inspiring home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29653 size-chrono" title="Lauren's feature in The New York Times" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="723" height="781" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-278x300.jpg 278w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-600x648.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>With a year left on her lease, timing was not an issue when Lauren closed on her new studio co-op in impossibly charming Brooklyn Heights. But with a desk where a master closet could be and a teeny closet where a chic workspace could be, Lauren needed some help to renovate before settling in. Read on for this first-time homeowner’s take on kitchen, bathroom, closet, and flooring updates throughout her lovely home.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Guest post by Lauren, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started looking for an apartment last fall, I had no idea what to expect. I had narrowed my ideal location to Brooklyn Heights for its proximity to Manhattan and quaint feel. Once I saw the listing for this co-op apartment online, I knew it ticked all of my boxes and was ecstatic when my offer was accepted. I had time on my side as I still had about a year left on my current lease (did not think the buying process would happen as quickly as it did) and I decided the apartment could use some updates to fit my style and taste a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space gets a lot of light and has a great view of the East River. I wanted to update the bathroom, darken the floors, and optimize storage space in the apartment. The way the previous owner had utilized storage space did not make sense to me; there was a large home office in a closet in the main living space and a small closet in the bed loft area. The bed loft also had a trap door for storage that was only accessible under the bed. I had no idea where to start looking for a contractor, but I remembered reading about an apartment renovation with Sweeten on <em>Apartment Therapy</em>. On a whim, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a>, and I waited to see what sort of responses I would get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the apartment to have a clean, fresh, modern, and calm feel with optimized storage to reduce clutter. I had most of my finishes and materials selected before starting the renovation, which made everything that much easier. I got two matches initially and then worked with Sweeten to line up more so I had more bids to compare. I met with four contractors and after much deliberation, I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one I chose completely understood my vision and desired style for the apartment. I asked him at one of our first meetings if there was anything that I hadn’t included in the scope of the renovation that I should have, and he immediately mentioned <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the walls and ceilings. The thought had never crossed my mind, but he pointed out the bowed beams on the ceiling and uneven surface on the walls. He educated me on why it was the best route to make this impactful update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, I knew that it would be difficult to darken the maple floors. Maple is a notoriously difficult wood to introduce stain, and I could tell from a preliminary search on Google just how hard it would be to accomplish. My contractor and his team did not back down from this challenge. They tried to go the normal route of staining first, and after the first round of testing and samples, we knew this would not give the desired result. They investigated different dyes and proper techniques for mixing the dyes and application. After some trial and error (and lots of labor), the floors turned out great!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To match my floors, my contractor re-built the bed loft platform out of the same maple flooring (as it was previously just plywood). He integrated a better storage solution under the bed loft, creating three bays to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for extra guests. He also installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe molding and base molding</a> throughout. In the bed loft area, after removing an existing closet, he created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in desk nook</a>.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29635 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the existing stove was quite small at 24” and I really like to cook and wanted a standard size range. Replacing the range proved difficult as the existing cabinetry configuration did not allow for a range with 30” of width. With some creativity, my contractor came up with the solution by notching out the cabinets by a half inch on either side, shifting one cabinet down, and making it into a cookbook shelf at my request. This allowed me to get a full-size Samsung 30” gas range.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29636 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29637 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing the range also meant replacing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>. I knew I wanted to change the existing dark marble countertops for a light-colored quartz option. I discovered that Pental Quartz Thassos was the brightest white quartz to complement the white gloss Ikea cabinets that I was leaving in place. The same material was used to make new windowsills as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was also updated with a new sink, faucet, dishwasher, refrigerator, marble backsplash, and new under-cabinet lighting. My contractor came up with another great idea to add a soffit on top of the kitchen cabinets to finish off the look. The kitchen lighting was replaced, swapping out three pendants for one large lantern pendant.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29643 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the fact that the bathtub was too short for its location really bugged me. There also was a very odd triangular corner which I thought was a terrible waste of space. Working with my contractor, I am so pleased with how the bathroom turned out. It feels like a mini spa. He squared off the triangular corner and broke through the wall to the exterior hallway, making the triangular corner into a linen closet that&#8217;s accessible right outside the bathroom. I added a drop-in tub that fits the space better and opened it up by replacing the shower curtain with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass shower panel</a>. The tinted shower tile gives the otherwise all-white bathroom a refreshing pop of color. New shower lighting highlights the unique color of the tile. The fixtures are from Kohler, as is the vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29646 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My contractor came up with a great idea for closets and went with larger 8-foot closet doors to make the space feel more expansive and draw your eye up to the beams. We replaced all the doors with single panel doors and simple chrome hardware. Two closets were customized by California Closets while the contractor and his team built shelving in the other two closets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also built a cover for the AC/heat unit in the living room, with the front panel mimicking the same style as the bathroom sink vanity. And he even took the time to come back to the apartment to mount the TV properly when a handyman I’d hired had an issue mounting it into a steel stud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator, Sweeten made the process pretty painless. My contractor takes great pride in his work, and as a client, I could not be happier with my experience working with him. Yes, there were delays (as there always are), but he was incredibly communicative and was able to handle my nerves and constant questions. He and his team are perfectionists and true craftsmen, and I could not be more pleased with their work. Everyone who comes to see the apartment sees the quality of how the tile is laid in the bathroom to how the floors are re-done, and I owe it all to my Sweeten contractor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">For Frans, a real estate broker, and his wife, Dalal, downsizing from a 2,500 square foot Flatiron District loft to a one-bathroom studio in neighboring Gramercy Park raised only one challenge: Where to put the mudroom! Size was hardly an issue for this unflappable couple, who set out to fit a few custom features into a much lower-maintenance space and came to Sweeten for a general contractor who could bring the vision together. Read on to see how they made room for a mudroom, master closets, and sleeping space for four in this mighty studio!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20138 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><span id="more-18627"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal were happy to leave behind extra square footage but wanted to bring a few specific features to their new home: A mudroom, to ward off sooty and sometimes snowy layers from city streets, wardrobe closets organized for two, and modern electrical wiring that would support an integrated system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They’d decided on this particular studio apartment because it offered a smaller but markedly similar version of the living room in their loft, and because eventually they planned to relocate to Long Island. So, a revamp would make this home convenient and comfortable until their next adventure, and put everything in place for a future crash pad. Frans enlisted a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>to achieve the loft-like space they had in mind, while personalizing a number of key features throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main studio space was a standard boxy room that backed up to one wall of windows and existing decor was mostly dark and decades old. Because of the single source of light, it took some imagination to carve up the room for use in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal designated the windowed area as their new living room, and aimed to update and expand the kitchen, bathroom, and wardrobes while incorporating an urban mudroom into a large hall closet. They also wanted to replace all of the dated finishes throughout the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the dark parquet floors, their contractor and his team made way for 7-inch white oak planks from Siberian Wood Flooring, and installed them throughout the home, even replacing the kitchen’s old linoleum black and white floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original 6 x 8-foot kitchen nook offered very little workspace surrounded by drab brown decor. Directly across from the nook was an oversized closet, which Frans hoped to incorporate into a new, larger kitchen design. The team took on major demolition to create a larger footprint and a workable U-shape, allowing for openness and access. They designed and built custom kitchen cabinetry, finished in putty-gray paint for the bottom cabinets, and white with glass panels for the upper line with seamless metal hardware. A number of cool custom features for specific storage needs are sprinkled throughout, and walnut shelving over the new under-mount sink helps extend the kitchen&#8217;s depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">White linoleum counters were tossed and replaced with natural white Bianco Brazilian marble with gray veining. Frans and Dalal chose a matte white glass subway-style tile for the backsplash, which now runs up the length of the wall by the new island, where two dining seats, plenty of additional counter space, and black pendant lighting are in easy reach. Top-grade stainless steel appliances replaced the tiny outdated white units, and a large professional-grade hood was fashioned over the 30-inch Bertazzoni gas oven range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the old closet, their contractor turned part of that into the mudroom Frans and Dalal were after, complete with custom shelving and various storage needs. And as an extension for the new kitchen, white custom cabinetry conceals the refrigerator and houses an exposed wet bar and wine fridge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal worked with Kris to create two customized and flexible sleeping spaces. Kris built sliding accordion doors out of walnut wood and opaque resin that stack together out of the way when opened, or become solid partition walls when extended and closed off.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom section, Kris built a king-sized platform bed and matching nightstands. In the living room, the team devised a plan for a customized built-in wall unit, incorporating a queen-sized murphy bed and guest closet all conveniently and seamlessly hidden behind white lacquered plywood. Across the room from this addition, Kris installed a single walnut shelf running alongside the wall and just off the floor to corral entertainment equipment and living room knick-knacks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Frans and Dalal had a few simple ideas in mind. Plain white tiles, dim lighting, and very old superficial hardware had outworn their welcome. The couple planned to get rid of all the existing dated decor, change the footprint to allow for a larger, more accessible layout, and customize the adjoining closet to cater to “his and her” needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kris tore everything out and rotated the footprint by 90 degrees to swap the shower and vanity, allowing for greater use of space overall. Old floor tiles were ripped out and light gray ceramic tiles, mimicking that of stone, went down in their place. Upon entering the bathroom directly off the bedroom, you’ll find an oversized white porcelain sink nestled into a new walnut wood vanity built entirely by Kris, finished with ultra modern red and silver metal hardware. To the left of the vanity stands a new glass shower, bedecked with skateboard street-art-style wall tiles for a very artistic, creatively modern, and very hip “New York” aesthetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wardrobe situation is impressive. A walk-in closet was already in place, but the couple had a better plan to build a more streamlined and highly organized pass-through closet. Using the door to the old closet, Kris custom built movable shelving units out of corresponding walnut wood for shoes and other sections for hanging clothes. These movable units lead to a separate bathroom entry to the back of the studio, where the living room sits. The homeowners also gained a new compact washer/dryer to complete the turn-around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Not one to miss the tiniest of details, Frans had the entire apartment wired for temperature, lighting, and sound control he conveniently accesses via phone. Frans and Dalal not only got the mudroom, but also managed to fold in multiple, flexible spaces to this origami apartment. Their new “studio” might be the only one in all of Manhattan with as many separate rooms as they now have, perfectly positioned within one unique space.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-dining-table-black-chairs" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48490 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18.jpg" alt="White dining table with black chairs and happy couple with dog after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work, business school, and an appetite for adventure had Joel and Eric relocating from NYC to overseas and back again. With New York soil permanently underfoot, the couple set their sights on a spacious one-bedroom co-op with loads of potential in the heart of Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights area. Ready to undo a decade-old renovation of glitter paint and overly dark finishes, this couple teamed up with a Sweeten general contractor and his past Sweeten clients, designers <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casey and Kumar</a>, to get it done.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Joel, Prospect Heights homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, work opportunities and the promise of adventure led my partner, Eric, and I to leave NYC. We lived abroad, I went to business school, and we even found ourselves settling in Downtown Detroit for a while. But in early 2015, moving prompted us yet again; this time unexpectedly back to where our journey began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, it was smart that we kept the small studio apartment that Eric owned when we left. It made the logistics of moving back to the city easy to stomach. To save money, we set a goal of living in the studio for as long as possible. “How bad could it be?” we thought: the studio is in an awesome location with great subway access, and is surrounded by dog-friendly parks. This was wishful thinking. 400 square feet turned out to be far too small for two men and a precocious American Eskimo Dog named Comet.</span></p>
<h3>Finding a new home in Prospect Heights</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We embarked on a hunt for more spacious digs with some basic criteria: a well-proportioned, reasonably priced (by NYC standards), pet-friendly 1BR/1BA apartment with dog-friendly parks nearby. After a four-month search, we finally closed on a large, corner apartment in a welcoming co-op. We had spent summer and fall weekends attending open houses from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights to Brooklyn Heights – only to end up in the building right next door to where we were already living – in Prospect Heights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features in the new apartment that struck us during our first open house visit: plentiful sunlight streaming in from multiple large windows on three sides, ample storage space, an in-unit washer and dryer, and rooms with generous proportions. The apartment is located in a 1920’s-era co-op building on a stretch of Eastern Parkway where many units contain sunken living rooms, high ceilings, and elaborate ornamental details. But sometime in the early 2000s, our apartment suffered a poorly executed renovation that installed heavy, dark cabinetry throughout, dark flooring and dark paint colors. One of the strangest choices: kitchen walls painted metallic silver in which actual glitter had been included. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from these superficial issues, there were also some fundamental flaws in the floor plan that we wanted to change. An awkward entry foyer &#8211; too small to fit a full-size dining table but too large to be a hallway &#8211; adjoined an enclosed, undersized kitchen. Similarly, a short, dark hallway led to a cramped bathroom that lacked sufficient storage and counter space. The bathroom always smelled damp and musty because the floor and walls were finished with absorbent limestone tiles.</span></p>
<h3>Finding the right experts for the job</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the weekends we spent open-house hopping, Eric and I met a woman selling her charmingly renovated Crown Heights apartment who raved about Sweeten. Months later, after closing, we recalled this conversation and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the vision for our renovation on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We eventually connected with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a></strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eric and I were impressed by the portfolio of work that Kris had executed for other clients, especially his focus on simple finishes and quality craftsmanship. Eric and I contacted references; one of the references was a designer named Kumar. He and his wife Casey, also a designer, had just moved into their apartment and had <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated with Sweeten and the same contractor</a>. Kumar invited us to visit. When Eric and I arrived at Casey and Kumar’s apartment, we were stunned by their beautiful, comfortable, modernist apartment renovation that was full of thoughtful construction details.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Eric and I fancy ourselves as design-minded, we didn’t have the ability to design or manage a renovation that would approach Casey and Kumar’s beautiful home. Kumar must have intuited this because he suggested that we could hire Casey, who was already planning to launch a freelance design career, to serve as our project designer and manager. We loved this proposal and signed up as their inaugural client. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The design process was holistic and thorough. They started our first meetings asking us how we lived our lives at home, the kinds of physical objects and furniture we have (or would like to have), and how we wanted to use the new space. Knowing that Eric and I wanted a calm and minimalist aesthetic with some warmth, Casey composed a palette of colors in shades of white, grey and blue and materials consisting of stones and wood grain to employ throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the kitchen, Kumar strongly advised that since we had a well-proportioned apartment, converting the kitchen to an open concept with the living room wasn’t desirable. With our contractor&#8217;s help, we discovered that multiple gas and water pipes in the wall between the kitchen and living room made this idea impractical. He determined it was feasible to enlarge the kitchen by removing the wall separating it from the foyer. With a larger kitchen, we gained an opportunity to extend the countertop and increase the workspace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to somehow create a relationship between the kitchen and living room, Casey came up with the brilliant idea of installing a unified countertop, designed as a monumental piece of furniture, that wraps around the wall between the two rooms with plenty of integrated storage underneath. On the kitchen side, this counter would serve as the kitchen prep workspace. On the living room side, the countertop could function as a buffet surface adjacent to where we planned to place a dining table. At the peninsula end where the two sides meet, a beautiful waterfall edge would function as a service and conversational area for drinks or appetizers during dinner parties.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the countertop material, Eric and I wanted marble but decided against it due to cost, softness, and tendency to absorb stains. Our contractor recommended we use durable Caesarstone and we went with the “Raw Concrete” finish. Working with his carpenter, Casey and Kumar designed custom white oak kitchen cabinets to mirror the new lighter wood flooring that replaced the black mosaic floor tiles. We stripped the existing floors elsewhere in the apartment and refinished them with a much lighter stain to match the new kitchen floor. The two items we kept from the original kitchen were the Bosch stove and dishwasher left by the previous owners. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely gutted the bathroom and indeed enlarged it by incorporating part of the adjacent hallway. The washer/dryer closet door used to open into this narrow hallway that would now be part of the bathroom. We reversed the orientation of the washer/dryer closet so it opened instead to the more spacious bedroom. Casey designed a glass enclosed shower stall to replace the tub. The floating Duravit Scola sink and streamlined Toto toilet were chosen for their minimal footprints, helping to increase the sense of openness in the small space. We utilized a minimalist material palette for the bathroom: honed slate tile floors and white subway tiles for the walls, with a floating white oak shelf above the sink for a touch of warmth. The Toto toilet washlet was an indulgence we wanted to include from our experience abroad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen and the bathroom were the biggest design and construction interventions in our project. But throughout the apartment, our designers were adamant that we address numerous small and simple details that Eric and I never would have thought of on our own. A few examples: In the entry hallway there was already a large coat closet. Casey and Kumar convinced us to create a new pantry out of some of the former foyer space. Not only did we get additional food storage, but the outer wall of the new pantry now lined up with the refrigerator wall of the kitchen, helping to reinforce the visual identity of our newly enlarged kitchen space. At the entry to the sunken living room, the team recommended removing the wrought iron rails and squaring off the formerly rounded stair landing. And inside the shortened hall between the bedroom and bathroom that used to be a shadow cove, the decorative arch was removed and the ceiling lowered to be flush with the lower ceiling level of the adjacent sunken living room. These and other small changes clarified what used to be many intersecting and conflicting lines and helped the overall design feel cohesive. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design scheme for our apartment was far more thoughtful and sophisticated than Eric and I expected. But the quality of the end result would not have been possible without the customer commitment and attention to quality from our contractor. From the very beginning, we felt confident that we were putting our investment in safe and competent hands. In any construction project, you expect a certain amount of unforeseen problems and ours was no exception. One significant example towards the end of the project: the stone subcontractor installed the three massive pieces of the Caesarstone countertop. After the installation cured, it looked beautiful, but the pieces were not sized perfectly. To an untrained eye, the difference wasn’t immediately noticeable, but Casey noticed the problem and brought it to our attention. Our Sweeten contractor immediately took ownership of the error. A week or so later, the stone fabricators returned and put in new pieces. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be happier with the end result of our apartment renovation. It’s an amazing feeling to come off the busy streets of New York City and enter our new home that is beautiful, serene, and supremely comfortable, and have space to entertain or host guests. We got to this result through the work of a couple of talented young designers and a builder we were incredibly happy to work with. Sweeten made this all possible. A happy customer told us about Sweeten. Sweeten helped us find an excellent contractor. And through good word-of-mouth from the contractor’s previous client, we unexpectedly also ended up hiring that client as our project designer and manager. As very satisfied customers, Eric and I are happy to continue that virtuous cycle.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When it came time to find more space, Hissan and Sophia—both attorneys—agreed on a handful of living requirements, but couldn’t quite see eye to eye on style. The new parents had decided on a three bedroom / two and a half bath condo in Downtown Brooklyn; it had high ceilings, good bones and great subway access, but now came the hard part—making it their own. After seeing another family’s Sweeten renovation in the New York Times, Hissan <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their renovation project</a></strong>, hoping to get design expertise for a facelift in a few high impact places. We matched them with <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten team</a></strong>, who were game to help the new homeowners navigate between traditional style (Sophia’s vote) and a modern industrial look (Hissan’s vote).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hissan-sophias-kitchen-foyer-renovation-downtown-brooklyn/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16691 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hissan-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="hissan-kitchen" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hissan-kitchen-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hissan-kitchen-1-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They wanted to enhance some of the condo’s most visible features (the long entry hallway, open kitchen, high ceilings, and wood floors). Functionality was already in place; the goal here was to incorporate creativity and style. <span id="more-16626"></span>Anishka and Niya got to work, producing detailed renderings and tweaks and assisted the couple on shopping trips as they worked together to incorporate more interesting materials.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16638" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16640" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-03" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Hissan_Kitchen-Before-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hissan and Sophia’s expert team started with the floors, deciding to strip the light bamboo planks already in place and stain them a darker, warmer hue. Most of the design work occurred in the kitchen and called for connecting the island to the L-shaped counter, adding a significant pantry build-out near the fridge, and refinishing storage and prep spaces with beautiful materials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hissan and Sophia were able to leave the original cabinet base in place—a cost effective choice—and add another row of cabinets on top. Anishka and Niya’s designs directed the crew to build taller cabinet doors, doubling their former stature and interior shelving space for maximum storage and sleekness. They reused the original metal hardware, but finished the cabinetry in white, bringing more light into the space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team chose Carrera marble to line the backsplash and accent the half-wall of cabinetry. The counters were replaced with quartz, a lovely contrast and a gorgeous alternative to the expense and maintenance of marble. They left in the original stainless steel appliances, except for the mini wine cooler, which they replaced with a coordinating pull-out garbage bin. Recessed lighting, two oversize pendants above the island, and under-cabinet lights transformed the room from dark and boring to luminous sophistication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anishka and Niya sourced reclaimed dark wooden beams for installation along the ceiling—one of the most dramatic changes to the home, giving it that raw lofty appeal that Hissan was after. To revamp the entryway, the designs called for dropping the high ceiling by about two feet, covering piping and providing a clean, uniform look. Custom moldings were introduced here as well, while the doors to the entry, extra bedroom, and powder room were either replaced or trimmed in matching moldings and painted a saturated gray hue to complement the lighter walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it turned out, Anishka and Niya had also designed one of Sophia’s favorite local restaurants, which is what inspired the decision to incorporate accent wallpaper. Oversized pendants provide warm light to the long corridor and guide visitors to the rest of the home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s been over a year now since Hissan, Sophia, and their new baby settled into their redesigned condo. The couple heavily credits Anishka and Niya for recognizing what they’d imagined for their new home and seeing it realized. Both advise homeowners and future renovators to try and get as much work done prior to moving in—especially the floors—but to take your time with the decor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When we first entered the New York City real estate market, my husband and I had three goals in mind. The first was to stay in our beloved neighborhood, Astoria, the second was to have more space than our rental, and the third was to have an open kitchen. Of course, all of this coupled with the most important goal–to stay under budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A wise friend told us to be prepared to have our hearts broken. After months of searching and touring the limited number of apartments available in Astoria, we came across The One. It was beautifully modern, with all of the bells and whistles that I yearned for as an avid baker and home entertainer. A few weeks into negotiations, the deal fell apart. I was heartbroken, and we were back on the market. Two days later, we put an offer in on our current home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew when we first saw the apartment that it would need a makeover. While the kitchen and bathroom were perfectly adequate (as it had only been constructed four years ago), it just wasn’t our style, and there were minor details that indicated sloppy work and cut-corners. We had a limited budget and wanted to renovate both the kitchen and the bathroom &#8212; two expensive spaces. We wanted to convert the tub to a walk-in shower to maximize space in the bathroom and we also wanted to improve functionality in the kitchen to optimize space and utilize every square inch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I spent hours and hours on Pinterest, secretly plotting the perfect kitchen and bathroom. My colleague told me about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> one day when I mentioned I was looking for a general contractor. (She’s now going through her own Sweeten renovation in Brooklyn!) I was instantly hooked on the Sweeten blog, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/13712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> the day our closing date was announced. When we were introduced to our Sweeten contractor, I didn’t know what to expect, but meeting her was not what I had in mind for meeting a general contractor. It was more like meeting an old friend. She was warm, open-minded, knowledgeable, and she instantly put me at ease. We discussed my very detailed vision (from weeks of Pinning!) and she seemed to “get” me immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The style I envisioned was a mix between classic glam, modern, and vintage touches that were a nod to pre-war NYC apartments of the 1920s and 30s. In the kitchen, we initially discussed ways in which we could preserve the cabinets to save on budget; however, we soon realized that this was a kitchen that would be called to greatness. my contractor brought in a millworker who built beautiful custom cabinetry, and we walked through every corner of that kitchen, discussing every cabinet, every door, every square inch of space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided on a configuration that would truly maximize the kitchen for a cook – moving the island a few inches to accommodate both a pull-out spice rack and utensil rack on either side of the stove, adding a pull-out trash and recycle bin underneath a 30” apron front sink, removing the overhead microwave for a full size hood, relocating the microwave to the island while adding six drawers: four tiny ones for utensils and two large ones for pots and pans, a kick toe drawer for the little things like kitchen towels, large pull-out drawers that opened from the front of the island for my collection of baking tools and sprinkles, and dividers for all of my baking sheets in the cabinet above the refrigerator. The meeting was energizing and Charles’ passion really came through&#8211;waving his arms in the most animated fashion, talking about wood types and inlay cabinet doors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To finish the kitchen, we chose a beautiful, slate-like porcelain tile flooring, dramatic brushed brass hardware from Martell Hardware, a show-stopping champagne gold faucet from Delta, a two-toned paint treatment with warm white for the upper cabinets and an unexpected jewel blue for the lowers, a traditional subway tile backsplash with dark grout, and finally, a gorgeous white quartz countertop that mimicked the veining of Carrara marble without the porousness. (Thanks to the contractor and my husband, Chris, for talking me out of sparkly, recycled glass quartz with specks of glitter.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Chris took the initiative to find vintage inspired hardware to match our vision of a modernized, New York City pre-war bathroom. We took inspiration from all of our favorite restaurant bathrooms in Astoria and Manhattan. For the flooring, we chose lovely matte black hexagon tile which the crew installed beautifully despite it being a difficult tile to lay perfectly. To maximize visibility, we chose to install a panel of glass instead of a shower with a door. We selected a traditional style rain showerhead and a handshower with a porcelain handle. For the vanity, we went with a modern, gray floating vanity with a Carrera marble top and faucet hardware with white porcelain handles. The walls received a gorgeous treatment of white subway tile with gray grout and an unexpected yet bold touch – black wallpaper featuring golden pineapples from Rifle Paper Co.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Home renovations can be extremely stressful, especially when you choose to live through the renovation. Through this experience, we have showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week. The amount of dust and debris seemed inexhaustible. Yet to see the daily progress, to see our vision come to life, made it all worthwhile. The contractor&#8217;s team made us feel comfortable and we saw them so often they became almost like family. In fact, our pug started to wait at the door every morning for the team to arrive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation taught us many things. We learned about trusting others to work in our home and take care of it. We learned about our own preferences, managing budget and timeline, and how to compromise. We learned about community, our wonderful neighborhood that opened its arms to us when we didn’t have basics like running water for a few days. We learned the names of baristas and bartenders, the cost of raw materials and the process of how a house becomes a home. Our condo is a perfect square; it’s our little 580 square foot shoebox. For my husband and I and our 9-year-old pug, it’s cozy, functional, luxurious, and most importantly, home.</p>

<em>Guest post by Jenna, Chelsea homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our three-bedroom, two-bath home in Chelsea in 2008. At first, we painted and got rid of the popcorn ceiling but otherwise had a long, outstanding list of items to complete after our initial move in. My husband and I were expecting our first child six years later and thought: what better time to renovate a home than a few months before the baby is due! We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Upon our first meeting, it was clear that he was willing to indulge my creative side and workshop out-of-the-box ideas along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was eager to modernize and lighten the home. Over the years, I lost patience with the worn parquet maple floor and the mismatched color palette in the kitchen. Every surface in the home needed a facelift. And with a baby on the way, we had the very immediate challenge of creating a nursery and guest bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19146 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19145" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we replaced the countertops, floors, cabinet doors, and backsplash. My goal was to create a soft, clean space—bringing in details like a slate floor and light gray marble backsplash to complement the natural floor tiles. I added agate and stone knobs on the cabinets and drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m in the process of creating a &#8220;bucket list&#8221; installation for the remaining wall, though I&#8217;m enjoying the space the empty wall creates. I went with an all-white countertop with no veins as I simply couldn’t find a slab that I was excited about in my price range. Everything, even the natural granite, looked man-made.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to feel like I was in a luxurious hotel bathroom when I was at home, so I opted for softer lighting and intricate tile work in both bathrooms. I hate seeing soap bottles from outside a shower, so our contractor’s team embedded four shelves into the wall along the shower structure. I purchased the sink base from IKEA but had custom marble tops made and chose sconces over harsh bathroom lighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gray floors are obviously in, but mostly because they substantially soften the weight of a room. In fact, it’s the first thing people notice when they see the ‘before and after’. We added taller baseboards which also add height to each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We re-carpeted the two bedrooms on the lower level, white shag in the baby’s room as I knew lots of people would be hanging out on the floor with the baby, and white patterned carpet everywhere else. My friends with kids told me I was crazy for choosing white but so far the baby has accommodated the need to keep it clean!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The baby’s room needed to be cozy, magical, and PRACTICAL. The tree that hovers over the baby’s crib is made of the tree trunks from the four posts of the huppah at our wedding. I’ve created and commissioned a series of dream catchers that float among the branches (not over the crib!) from treasures I’ve collected all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was very grateful to our contractor for helping in the final details of the nursery—his team secured some elements of the changing table and helped hang some of the complicated wall hangings that I insisted on having.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two newlyweds came to Sweeten for help finding a general contractor with design expertise to update and brighten their two-bedroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Read on down to see a classically sweetened kitchen, master bath, and powder room!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20220" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantages of this couple&#8217;s new place were very clear: beamed ceilings and big windows in every room brought lovely natural light throughout the unit, and original hardwood floors lent a relaxed look to the space. The kitchen, visible from the foyer, dining room, and living room, had two gracious windows but was outfitted with miniature appliances, isolated blocks of cabinets, and dark finishes. And while the kitchen and both bathrooms had been treated to some relatively recent updates, this couple saw potential for modern features and additions that would help them get settled. With the closing officially on the books, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple posted their project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten, calling for a designer and builder who could help them make the most of the square footage in the kitchen and bathrooms before moving in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>matched them with a Sweeten design-build firm</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Together, they devised a plan to create a more spacious and bright kitchen and newly updated baths with elegant finishes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18737"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18737 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_mila_kitchen-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractors began with the kitchen, gutting the space entirely. The apartment’s oak floors were worn, but the telltale parquet plank details and inlaid borders were enough to convince the team to leave them in place, restore them, and extend them into the kitchen, replacing the section of pine flooring that had made its way in during a previous renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This design-build firm specializes in custom millwork and brought a signature white shaker look to this couple’s kitchen. They went minimal in the most visible places, limiting full cabinet lines to one wall, adding a bit of open shelving to the windowed wall, and significantly extending base cabinets around the back wall of the dining nook. These design decisions aimed for maximum light and an open feel. They tore out the windowsill just to the left of the dining nook to make way for that additional counter and cabinet space, and finished the full set with contrasting black knobs and sturdy pulls. The old black stone counters were replaced with white and soft gray quartz, blending the new white and black combo seamlessly.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18728"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18728" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg" alt="all-white kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18746" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="custom built-in shelf" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowners were keen on replacing their compact oven and dishwasher with full-size versions, so the pair gained a sleek new Verona gas range with an exhaust hood fashioned with custom oak shelves on either side, stained to match the new floors. A full size Bosch dishwasher took the place of the old, just to the left of the stove and concealed behind coordinating cabinetry panels. The couple chose a large white Kohler farmhouse sink and chrome Moen faucet, situated nicely under the far window. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new stainless steel double-door fridge is now flanked by custom pantry storage, and the Sweeten contractor pulled the entire update together with a simple beveled white marble backsplash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like the kitchen, the homeowners wanted cosmetic changes to both bathrooms to reveal more of their personal style and taste, favoring neutral colors and patterns and aiming for a brighter, cleaner feel. Nothing too extravagant, too old, or too contemporary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided on simple geometric shapes and a natural palette in both. The master bath received a full gut without changing the footprint. Cloudy square floor tiles were tossed and delicate carrara marble pieces in soft bluish grays went down. The old shower/tub combo was of average height and size and contained very basic hardware. The couple chose a deep cast-iron Soissons Kohler bath with multiple Rohl hardware fixtures in a gorgeous muted polished nickel. A dark wood vanity sink originally stood to the left of the tub but was replaced with a much lighter wood finish with twice the storage space. A chic square mirror with an antiqued bevel stands over it, and new Kohler toilets were added in both bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, the same cloudy square floor tiles were replaced with a herringbone tile in soft gray and white, while the same square wall tiles were swapped for a subway style in white marble. The homeowners selected a slender dark wood vanity and square white porcelain sink, along with a silhouette mirror trimmed in wood to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The general contractors sanded and stained the oak wood floors throughout the rest of the apartment, and in doing so they replaced all of the white shoe molding as well. The walls were stripped and repainted, mostly white or the palest gray-blue found in the new powder room.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg’s game plan for their little galley kitchen seemed pretty straightforward: take down one wall to open the space up to the rest of the living room, and repurpose the dining nook for an office that might one day be a nursery instead. But when twin daughters arrived, this forward-thinking renovation went from nice-to-have to must-have!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-new-kitchen-makes-way-for-two-new-arrivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18560 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sarah-kitchen.jpg" alt="sarah-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sarah-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sarah-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-18559"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah, an Academic Dean for a charter school, and her husband, Oleg, moved into their Prospect Heights one-bed, one-bath co-op knowing they’d eventually want to do something more with their galley kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was walled off to the living room with an entry point at each end. One door opened to the apartment’s foyer and one led to a windowed dining nook with shelving. Red floor tiles set a dark tone for the room and a prior renovation had missed the chance to extend the upper line of cabinetry toward the ceiling. Finishes aside, the extra dining space provided a few possibilities for new use. Opening the kitchen to the living room would create new bar seating and free Sarah and Oleg to re-purpose the dining nook as a small study. “One day…” was the thinking on the need for a nursery, so </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they decided to post their project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>we matched them with Sweeten Expert Niki</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who brought close to twenty years of residential and commercial design experience.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18575" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niki and her team helped Sarah and Oleg get started with plans to update the kitchen, maximize space, and bring modern style and white finishes to the new open-concept living room. Cabinets and counters came down to make way for the wall removal between the kitchen and living room. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the kitchen newly open, the team began relocating appliances to create a more convenient U-shape, with a dining bar peninsula serving as a partition between the two rooms. The sink stayed in place but the stove found a new home at one end of the kitchen, while a new stainless steel fridge bookends the other. Niki installed deep storage cabinets and electrical outlets in the knee space of the island, utilizing every square inch necessary for purpose and function. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg chose rows of light gray tile planks reminiscent of pale slate to line the kitchen floors, taking the place of the former brick-colored square tiles. Sarah knew she wanted finishes that were modern yet classic, and white cabinets topped the list. Niki specializes in crafting custom wood cabinetry, so she put these skills to good use for the couple, building and installing base and upper cabinets in clean white with crisp nickel knobs and drawer pulls. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple chose a muted gray quartz for the counters, and a stainless undermount sink with chrome faucet replaced the old set-up. Niki customized open shelving directly over the sink to offset cabinet uniformity, give easy access to everyday pieces, and give the kitchen a little more visual depth. The couple chose white subway tiles for their new backsplash, which reflect a bright glow thanks to under-cabinet lighting. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg prioritized room for a double oven from LG and compensated for space with a counter-depth french door Whirlpool fridge. A Whirlpool dishwasher rounded out the new appliances, and in keeping with the theme of “twos”, Niki installed a pair of glass pendants over the bar top, which accessorize the new space beautifully. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the bonus room fashioned out of the former dining nook, Sarah and Oleg were more than pleased to find the new space fit not one but two cribs, perfect for new twin sisters, Ava and Sophie. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18567 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-06-07.gif" alt="custom white cabinets" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18564 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="white subway tile backsplash" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18568" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gorgeous new space doesn&#8217;t let on that during the renovation process, a leak from a neighboring unit required extra work for the crew. Sarah reports that Niki and her team were completely flexible and took on the additional projects: finishing floors, repainting rooms, redoing molding and drywall, all to make sure the entire space came together. We’re so glad to hear this team made it all happen!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18464 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18465" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="window seat" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a new contender in the tiny urban kitchen competition! </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/annes-sweetened-willow-street-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A half galley in Brooklyn Heights</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has held the honor up to this point, but a 25-square-foot Upper East Side kitchen looks like it might edge out all competitors. With an eye on re-sale value, the owner of this Manhattan studio came to Sweeten to make the most of a small space with new finishes and a delightfully scrappy use of modern materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-tiny-kitchen-gets-a-big-makeover-sweeten-on-the-upper-east-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18265" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18251"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“My contractor made my kitchen renovation a painless experience. He has an excellent eye for design and materials and is willing to work with your budget. His brother and the rest of the renovation team are incredibly hard-working and left the work site immaculate at the end of every day.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>&#8211; Upper East Side homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After settling into her studio apartment in the Yorkville section of New York’s posh Upper East Side, this new homeowner saw opportunity in what felt like a “disaster”. The kitchen floor and subfloor were cracked, appliances were dated, the small sink and stove had no backsplash protection, and the nook was starting to look as if it hadn’t been cleaned in years. The tiny L-shaped kitchen soon became the main focal point for a makeover. Set on keeping the project within a specific budget, the studio’s owner </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project to Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we matched her with a Sweeten general contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a contractor with two decades of experience helping homeowners achieve quality renovations at every budget. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18264" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project post called for some specifics and laid out a few materials to avoid: yes to new white cabinets, Caesarstone counters, and subway tile, and no to floor grout that would attract grime. Her contractor got to work right away, removing all of the existing kitchen finishes to make way for more modern selects&#8211;without having to change the footprint. Charcoal-hued porcelain floor tiles replaced every bit of the dingy, broken originals, setting the tone for chic black and white all around. The original cabinets were torn out to make way for more modern Shaker-style white cabinets, maximizing additional storage space and finished with brushed silver metal pulls. The laminate countertops were swapped for a more luxe black Caesarstone with a stainless undermount sink and coordinating faucet that mimics the modernity of the cabinet hardware. The Sweeten contractor installed a gleaming subway tile backsplash in black glass, and crisp white paint brightens up the new space. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The studio’s owner went for stainless appliances in lieu of the older white originals, and she particularly wanted a vented hood for the oven range. The contractor saw to it that these accessories were incorporated in the design. A sleek new fridge took the place of the former, plus a gas range, coordinating hood, and a compact microwave right above it&#8212;a much better location than before when the microwave was oddly stuck between the fridge and sink. With contrasting black and white throughout the new space, and alternating matte and glossy surfaces, the new lighting pendant casts a gorgeous glow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new baby for Lindsay and Matt would bring big changes for the couple, clearly. But one of those changes would mean leaving their cozy Park Slope walk-up to find more space and flexibility for their growing family. Committed to staying in Brooklyn, they purchased a promising co-op apartment in Ditmas Park, with hopes of converting their one-bedroom into a two while subtly upgrading a number of the uninspiring finishes in their kitchen and beyond. Read on for Lindsay’s take on their creative (and altogether pretty budget-friendly) home renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-paul/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20345 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Kitchen_Portrait-02-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Lindsay, Ditmas Park homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many New Yorkers, after Matt and I had a baby we started yearning for more (or at least a different kind of) space. We lived in a Park Slope brownstone walk-up, and while our apartment was full of charm, we realized it was going to become more and more difficult to live there as our daughter grew older with its stairs, open fireplaces, jagged floors, and somewhat awkward layout. So, we jumped on the real estate bandwagon, setting our sites on convertible one-bedroom apartments since two-bedroom co-ops were mostly out of our price range.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being outbid several times in Prospect Heights and Windsor Terrace, we eventually ended up in Ditmas Park, where Matt had previously lived and where we first met. There, we found a one-bedroom in a building constructed in 1941 with a ton of charm, including pointed arch doorways and an inset bookcase. Our future building was a co-op, and ours was a sponsor unit that had recently undergone a renovation including a new kitchen and bathroom. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the place was in pretty good shape, the major component of our renovation was to separate the single bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. We debated over a few layouts and decided to demolish the closets, build a partition, and create a new door opening from the living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an architectural historian and frequent reader of design blogs, I was familiar with Sweeten and the service they offered. With the baby, work, a long unfinished doctoral dissertation, and the seemingly unending closing process, I didn&#8217;t have much time to do the legwork to find contractors or figure out how to schedule things. When the contractor we selected dropped out for a bigger Manhattan project right before closing, we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project with Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;who were great in helping us find someone else in a pinch. In the end, they matched us with a Sweeten general contractor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was incredibly competent and quickly helped reduce my anxiety about the whole project. We had decided most of the big things, but he was great in helping us think through the smaller issues, such as where to put outlets and what kind of paint to choose.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this time, our scope had also expanded a bit. In addition to some (unexpected) electrical work, we decided on a few aesthetic upgrades in the kitchen and bathroom, where the finishes were somewhat “cheap” and bland. We weren’t going for total transformations here. Just a handful of subtle upgrades to the existing decor that also aligned with our overall budget.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our budget was pretty small, we aimed to get the most bang for our buck. In the kitchen, we replaced the laminate countertop with a quartz Caesarstone counter and installed a new stainless undermount sink and chrome faucet, white subway tile backsplash, and new ceiling lights.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we replaced the pedestal sink with a more modern sink and vanity cabinet, added metal shelves, and installed new lights. These changes were small, but they made a huge difference in how the space looked and functioned. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, construction went very smoothly. We were staying in sublets, so Paul knew that the work needed to be done as soon as possible. Paul wrapped things up right on schedule and before we knew it, we lived there! It was a great first-time renovating experience and I&#8217;m definitely itching to take on the next project.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John lived in his two-bedroom Hell’s Kitchen co-op apartment for practically a decade before addressing a number of areas in the home that had been neglected over time. Stately pre-war molding from the early 1920s was buried under years of paint, ancient water damage permeated some walls, electrical outlets were sparse&#8211;even door knobs were finicky. Ready to make significant changes to the kitchen, bedrooms, and book storage space just in time for Katharine to move in, the couple—both behind-the-scenes professionals in the entertainment industry—needed a crew to help transform their home into a modern day co-op with old-world charm. Read on for John’s take on their thoroughly ambitious home renovation!</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/john-and-katharines-sweetened-manhattan-apartment-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18042" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg" alt="manhattan apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by John, Hell’s Kitchen homeowner </span></i><span id="more-18013"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the apartment was largely in its original, 1923 state. We loved a lot of the classic details but many of them had begun to decay and the plaster walls were in various states of disrepair. It was increasingly difficult to keep clean. So, the primary goal was to restore the walls and floors to good working order, replace the trim and molding that was falling apart, and generally remove a lot of the cluttered and clashing elements that had built up over the years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen had been redone at least once, probably in the late 90s, but the life of that renovation was ending and the cabinets were breaking and falling apart. We wanted to find a way to make the small kitchen/living room space work. We weren’t making substantial structural changes and wouldn&#8217;t be moving plumbing or gas, but the whole space definitely needed a general cosmetic and electrical make-over. So, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a design and construction team to take on the work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18037 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18039 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18041" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room, especially, was a challenge. It had a reasonably sized kitchen, which is great because I cook a lot, but finding a way to balance the space between kitchen and living room without shortchanging either was really the central problem we tackled. It had previously been semi-divided by a wall and an island which left the corner around the couch dark and cramped, and still didn&#8217;t allow for a full-sized fridge. We removed the wall and created a central island that could function as both a work space and a dining table. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I splurged on a dual-fuel Wolf range, which was right up against the realm of possibility given the amount of available power to the apartment, but which I&#8217;m pretty happy about (a gas stovetop is basically essential, as far as I&#8217;m concerned). The refrigerator is a 32&#8243; french door model, not quite &#8220;full sized&#8221;; I found the unit that offered the most storage volume but which could still physically fit, with the doors removed, into the small freight elevator in our building. We originally had a slightly larger model that did not fit. I toyed with recruiting friends to help me carry it up to the tenth floor. In retrospect, this probably would have been a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The microwave is also Wolf; they make a unit that opens like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the traditional swing door style. It&#8217;s a little silly but this allowed us to install it in the kitchen island facing away from the front door, rather than in the more normal spot above the stove. I don&#8217;t use the microwave a ton and it seemed silly to give it that front and center pride of place; better to have the nice custom cabinet-fronts there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got fairly traditional knobs and miscellaneous hardware; we used unlacquered brass for the &#8220;living room&#8221; side of the main room and nickel for the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; side as a way to differentiate the shared space. We love the brass; the original knobs and apartment hardware are all nearly 100-year-old brass, and we specifically sought out the unlacquered pieces, which seem a little less common, because our hope is that over the years they will patina and start to take on some of the character of the old ones. Most of our miscellaneous hardware pieces are from Simon&#8217;s Hardware and Bath, and we&#8217;ve been pretty happy with them. We got slightly funky drawer pulls from Urban Archaeology, which were pricey, but which we really love. The pendant lights are from O&#8217;Lampia, a shop on the Bowery; the guy there makes custom pieces that we both really like, and we would enthusiastically recommend him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen faucet is Rohl, less expensive than the ubiquitous Waterworks (which is what I used for the bathroom renovation in 2008) and supposedly, at least according to our plumber, more reliable. Lever handles are key for me for a kitchen faucet, since it&#8217;s difficult to turn on cross handles with your elbows when your hands are covered in raw chicken. Having the spout elevated as high above the sink as possible is also pretty important to me, it allows more space to work when washing dishes (no dishwashers allowed in my building!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would count our (very consciously UN-oiled) blue/green soapstone on the kitchen island among our riskier&#8211;but ultimately most rewarding&#8211;design choices. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the apartment, we wanted to maintain as much of the pre-war character as possible, while also lightening and opening up the space. There was picture frame molding partway up the walls, which we replaced with crown molding at the ceiling. The style is similar but it makes the ceilings feel higher and complements the many beams without calling too much attention to them. Most of the choices we made were along these lines, classic in style but slightly more understated than the original as befits a fairly small apartment. We refurbished and kept original elements where we could, like the heavy doors and metal door frames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built in a lot of shelves and cabinets in order to maximize space and we opened-up the awkwardly placed living room closet (originally blocked by the couch) to make a kind of library/office nook that also makes the space feel larger.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18038 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18034 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="office nook" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For non-decorative lighting in the smaller spaces, we went with simple schoolhouse ceiling fixtures that are pretty similar to what was originally installed, again with brass accents. To fill out the three rooms, we also added track lighting, which is perhaps a little unusual. They are fairly unobtrusive and allow a lot of coverage, flexibility, and directionality while staying as close to the ceiling as possible (we would have had to drop the ceiling to install in-ceiling lights). We accented with warm-tone, high CRI LED fixtures in places where they could be installed, like in cabinets, the hallways, and in the kitchen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years after Kelly purchased her studio apartment in a lovely Brooklyn Heights co-op, she was ready to take on a major overhaul of the old appliances and cheap cabinets in the kitchen and bath. Unsure of the style she was after, Kelly sought the help of a designer who could run with big transformations to her little abode. Read on for our reveal of Kelly’s sparkling new kitchen, bathroom, and bonus closet renovations!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kellys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-sweeten-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17853" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg" alt="brooklyn heights co-op" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kelly-kitchen2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-17835"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“Courtney was fantastic! Her process for learning about the project, the space potential, and understanding who I am is her true talent. I always felt that I had a voice and control over the design, which was important to me, but Courtney effortlessly brought it to life.”<br />
</i><i><i></i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>-Kelly, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly had come to realize that living in a studio apartment meant that the kitchen would forever be the focal point—it “needed to rock”, as she put it. With old appliances and “cheap” cabinets and counters, the kitchen lacked a ton of functionality. An earlier attempt at open shelving left all sorts of things exposed, the cabinets extended just halfway to the ceiling, bar seating offered zero storage topped with a thin strip of counter prep space, and the stove and fridge were both miniature-sized. Kelly wanted to find an interior designer whose imagination wasn’t limited by tight spaces. She </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched her with Sweeten Expert Courtney</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pro at bringing ambitious texture and color to spaces large and small. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kelly wasn’t yet set on any specific style choices for her kitchen, Courtney was able to provide plenty of inspiration to get the renovation process started. The plans called for a few big fixes: Kelly’s team would extend the kitchen cabinets to ceiling height for more storage and finish the cabinetry with a variety of classic doors and transparent glass panes. The bar counter was significantly enlarged, granting more prep and dining space and doubling the kitchen’s drawer storage. And to accommodate a full-sized stove and fridge, Kelly moved the fridge out of the galley altogether.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly appreciated Courtney’s talent for mixing affordable items with the right amount of higher-end items for a polished look. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous flooring consisted of brick-colored tiles that dragged the room into darkness. Kelly chose eye-catching cement tiles in a white and soft black mosaic, evoking a sense of Moroccan-inspired decor. Kelly bid adieu to the old, sagging cabinets and selected a dove gray IKEA set for the bottom base with a matte white finish for the uppers, plus elegant chrome hardware for all. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her newly-enlarged bar counter, Courtney helped Kelly pick butcher block for its warmth and price point, offsetting that material with a natural stone for the opposite counter. Ready to pack a lot of texture into the small space, Kelly added another pop of personality with a subway-style backsplash of luminous blue hand-glazed ceramic tiles. This detail, along with new undercabinet lighting was the key to unlocking all of that brightness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rickety oven range was replaced with a sleek stainless stove and Kelly scored a matching microwave stationed directly above it. A new dishwasher now resides where the old fridge once stood, and Kelly had new storage and pantry cabinets constructed along the opposite wall, framing the fridge perfectly. Kelly did away with the harsh ceiling light and opted for low-profile recessed lighting instead, complementing her new space gorgeously.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="dove gray ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovation plan grew to include the bathroom as well as the secret to the success of any great NYC studio: a highly organized walk-in closet! Without changing the footprint of the bath, Kelly carried several of the design choices from the kitchen over for continuity and coherence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went with the same marbled stone look for the floors and shower walls while replacing the tub with a new white porcelain upgrade. In other splash-prone areas surrounding the sink and shower, Kelly decided on a pale gray glass tile stacked in clean, contemporary lines. The old vanity was replaced with a dark wood cabinet boasting deep storage drawers and a large rectangular sink basin, crowned with a simple mirror and a soft-glow lighting strip. Two chrome shower heads were installed, one flexible and the other stationary, creating an elegant spa oasis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last perk of this smart renovation came in the form of customizing the studio’s remaining closet, including shelving, section dividers, and a full-length mirror. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly’s lovely, revamped studio is proof that no space is too small for showcasing personal taste and imagination. We’re thrilled to hear that Courtney’s eye for design and hustle helped Kelly re-create this beautiful space!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldn’t focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Gregg’s take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17774" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg" alt="gregg-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zero’d in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say “we can’t believe this is actually our apartment”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A creative Brooklyn couple came to Sweeten with an enviable problem: they had a gorgeous townhouse on their hands, big on charm and original details, but a little low on the storage and conveniences that a modern, entrepreneurial family needs. <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2016/02/my-beauty-uniform-kavi-ahuja-moltz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi Ahuja Moltz </a>and David Seth Moltz, the fabulous duo behind the small batch perfume and cologne company <a href="https://dsanddurga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. S. &amp; Durga</a>, loved the rich wood trim that framed each window and the inlaid wood floors that ground each room, but earlier renovations in the kitchen and bathrooms had replaced many original materials with a hodge-podge of finishes. Seeking the skills of a designer and contractor, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, and we found their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4877#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> to re-think space and feel in the kitchen and two bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-undermount-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg" alt="White kitchen island with undermount sink and multifunctional faucet facing kitchen with abstract backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-17681"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill home presented an open kitchen plan with a large center island that had been updated with telltale features in the last decade: subway tile and a mix of wood finishes had been fit into an archway in the kitchen and pre-war moldings with gothic-inspired edges framed the oversized windows and a fridge nook. Storage was limited to two strips of base cabinetry and the butcher block counters added a third wood finish to the original floors and architectural details. Updates in the bathroom were similarly out of sync with the home’s original design, and a mix of modern tile, faux wood finishes, and slim storage left this family without a lot of storage options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor set out to preserve the most striking original floor and molding details and also push elements of the home toward a highly inventive and contemporary aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-hardwood-floor-kitchen-bathroom-before" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown hardwood floored open kitchen and bathroom with tempered shower glass door before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
(<em>credit for before photos: <a href="https://www.elliman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</a></em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without destroying any of those gorgeous hardwood floors, he addressed the most pressing of the to-dos first. The base cabinets were completely removed and replaced with a full wall of semi-gloss, flat front, white cabinetry from HenryBuilt with hidden hardware, framing the striking new <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> stove. While they did lose the original wall pocket trimmed in molding that housed the fridge, the new <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HenryBuilt</a> cabinets are far better suited for pantry purposes, and the new fridge was re-located to the right of the stove, camouflaged seamlessly with paneling. White stone composite counters replaced the butcher’s block, and a larger island replaced the former, keeping a similar silhouette with a mahogany base and ample knee space for diners. The stainless undermount sink was also enlarged, with a dramatic multi-functional chrome faucet, a standard workhorse behind the scenes in most restaurants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The backsplash is where the real drama resides. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles creating quite the abstract pop of modernity to the new kitchen that’s now a contemporary haven trimmed in pre-war luxe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the two bathrooms, the crew took a related design approach to tie in inspiration across eras, addressing the finishes without changing the footprint entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one full bath, tile again takes center stage with cement <a href="https://www.marrakechdesign.se/dandelion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dandelion tile</a> in Lawn/Milk on the floors. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depicting sunbursts replaced the previous, more subdued flooring. Simple white hex tile grounds the walk-in shower, and classic white subway tile stacked in a herringbone pattern extends up and around the walls. Frameless glass shower doors, a glossy lacquered double vanity with deep drawer storage, and a heated towel rack perfect this stylish high-low mix of materials. And because no detail was overlooked by this stylish couple, they opted for polished brass light fixtures to offset the muted tones and white on white textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kids’ bath, a parallel mix of white and gray shapes work equally simply to create a clean and bright space. White hex floor tile and contrasting gray grout is echoed with industrial white subway wall tile and more contrasting grout. Their Sweeten contractor made room for a new tub and double vanity, and added extra towel bar storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re back in beautiful Brooklyn Heights to tour the rest of Hari and Kaity’s gorgeous one-bedroom apartment. Last week, we showed off the couple’s </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new kitchen and bath</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now we’re on to the creative ways in which they upped the glamour of their living and bedroom spaces and doubled (quadrupled?!) bedroom closet storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17601 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights Renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-living-room-closet-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span id="more-17599"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hari and Kaity certainly did their homework when it came to collecting interior design inspiration and research. Perusing Pinterest and just about every architecturally-focused gallery out there, they pooled ideas and thought about renovations that had taken place in a neighboring apartment. They both loved the look of NYC’s quintessential pre-war buildings but also wanted to leave some room for more modern finishes. While the couple’s original </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was mainly focused on upgrading their kitchen, their renovation evolved with the help of their </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his team, as it began to make sense to take on work in other rooms while they were all at it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apartment’s floors had lost their luster, the living room was a blank slate, and the bedroom closet was clearly not cut out for a couple. Their contractor got to work, devising a plan to deliver smart upgrades in those high-impact places.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17503 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamal and his team sanded and stained the wood floors, bringing a rich depth and gleam to the wood planks that would serve as the basis for transformation in the living room and bedroom. Hari and Kaity initially pictured adding wainscot paneling to their living room and hallway, but after much debate decided it would be wasted once hidden behind furniture, so they opted for a series of decorative picture frame moldings instead. The simple addition was a low-cost and non-invasive way to give dimension to the boxy living room, and helps play up the shape of the apartment’s lovely window. They also decided to do away with ceiling fans, adding a glamorous tiered West Elm chandelier. This before and after is a testament to how refinished flooring, fresh paint, and luminous lighting choices can be enough to completely change a home!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17495 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg" alt="west elm chandelier " width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-10-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17496 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="picture frame moldings" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-11-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, the bedroom and its limited closet space. Square footage in the bedroom left plenty of room for furniture, but the single closet was not a long-term option. Their Sweeten contractor set his sights on the bedroom’s far wall, seeing just enough room to create closets out of thin air without cutting off access to the bedroom window.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17511 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17497 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="full-size closets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17603 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="black knobs" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He built out two full-size closet structures, filled the interiors with Kaity’s vision for custom shelving and storage, and finished the additions with detailed paneling on the new closet doors. Hari and Kaity replaced all of the silver lever door handles throughout the home with brushed black knobs—another simple upgrade with striking effect. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what to do with the old bedroom closet? Because the original closet was so close to the bedroom’s entryway, an open office nook was a smarter use of space. The sliding doors were removed and a cozy little studious retreat fell into place. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The ink was barely dry on the closing papers of their new Brooklyn Heights co-op when Hari and Kaity decided they were ready to renovate a number of areas in the one-bedroom apartment, with the kitchen at the top of the list. The cramped galley space came with issues that could clearly be improved, and both Hari and Kaity also felt that their bathroom was past its prime. Here’s a look at dramatic upgrades in both spots. Check back next week for the full living room and bedroom reveal!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17510 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg" alt="hari-kitchen-bathroom3" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hari-kitchen-bathroom3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-17481"></span>The kitchen in Hari and Kaity’s new place was cheery but filled with dated tile, attempts to overcompensate with bad lighting, and appliance placement that seriously cut into counter space. The windowed bathroom had great potential and had been carefully kept up, but Hari and Kaity saw opportunity for smarter storage and a chance to customize the tile with chicer selections. As first-time renovators, the couple decided to <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their renovation project</a></strong> on Sweeten and we matched them with <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Jamal</a></strong>, who was ready to help the couple settle into a home complete with major updates in every room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17507" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-Collage-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like most residents with NYC-style galley kitchens, Hari really wanted theirs to feel more open and emit more light—especially since this kitchen did not come with a window, as many do. The previous owner overcompensated by adding lighting strips to the tops and bottoms of the cabinets, but the kitchen’s layout was the real issue. Jamal got to work, designing a plan that would expose more of the room to the home’s entry and living area, relocate a key appliance, and expand storage and counter space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-Before-06-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17513 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17487" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamal’s team cut into the kitchen’s entry door frame and brought the fridge a few feet outside of the kitchen’s walls, which in return allotted for more counter and cabinet space. They yanked old floor tiles and installed large, textured stone-like tiles in their place. New dove gray IKEA cabinetry with silver hardware plus a taller line of upper cabinetry, some with glass paneling, replaced the shorter set of originals. Hari and Kaity chose smooth white Caesarstone for the countertop and decided on white subway tile for the backsplash in a herringbone pattern, incorporating the classic yet modern aesthetic they were after. Under-cabinet and interior-cabinet lighting now brings a warm, inviting glow and stainless steel appliances (plus room for a brand new paneled dishwasher!) completed the turnaround.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Jamal set his sights on revamping fixtures and finishes for a more stylish and functional retreat. Hari and Kaity hoped to gain a little extra storage space, but otherwise, the upgrade would be fairly straightforward and relatively cosmetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They chose a classic basketweave floor with marbled tiles and expanded the chic black and white look up the walls with white, undulated subway tile lined with a glossy black border. Jamal introduced a shower niche for subtle storage and replaced the old pedestal sink with a modern version that offered more room for soaps and daily necessities. Hari and Kaity kept the same mirrored medicine cabinet and pendant lighting, added a simpler set of glass shelves, and opted for a new Toto toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hari and Kaity love the new kitchen and bath, and we can’t help but be psyched to showcase the innovative work in the rest of this home next week. Get ready for stunningly lovely refinished floors, picture frame molding, and envy-inducing closets!</p>

</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jamie, Queens homeowner  </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband and I dreamt of buying a brownstone in Bed-Stuy. This dream was apparently shared by everyone else in New York, because trying to find a place—any place—was a humbling experience in getting outbid by foreign investors and other first-time buyers with resources greater than ours. After a year of frustration, we found a condo in a recently remodeled brick building in Ridgewood, Queens—a quirky little Polish-Ecuadorian neighborhood on the Brooklyn-Queens border that none of our friends had ever heard of. The good news was that the apartment was huge: the building’s original six units had been merged into three, giving us a yard and a finished basement to go with our ground-floor living space.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bad news was that the renovations had been undertaken in an aesthetic that my husband and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">described as “late-life Euro bachelor”: dark wood fixtures and liberal use of large brown Tuscan tiles that gave certain rooms the yellowish air of an Adirondack rental property you’d regret renting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17412 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first year in Ridgewood was dominated by DIY projects—refacing cabinets, painting, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gardening—that improved the overall look of our apartment. The projects that remained were too complicated to be mastered through YouTube videos and trial-and-error, which put us on the market for a contractor to do some larger projects. First in line: our trainwreck of a master bathroom, which when we bought the apartment had been renovated in a very dark (read: creepy) and not-so-functional (read: the showerhead didn’t line up with the tub) way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our search for a contractor stretched over a year. I interviewed people from all over—recommendations from coworkers and friends of friends, names from Brownstoner’s community forum, references in interior design books. There was also Angie’s List, which was effective in introducing me to a series of contractors from Long Island and Brooklyn who were well-versed in bathrooms that featured lots of fogged glass and Jacuzzis—not the bright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ELLE</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Décor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-type vibe I was going for. These candidates would generally show up, late and complaining about parking in my neighborhood, then tell me how the fixtures I wanted were going to be too expensive for my budget, how they thought the current bathroom was fine as-is, how I should do a better job training my dogs not to bark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like a series of first dates that I knew were going to be awful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in the process I had read about Sweeten, but let’s be clear: I was far too jaded to be anything but skeptical. I went to their site and decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4383" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of sheer desperation. They first connected me with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from day one, I was impressed. He showed up on time, listened carefully to what I was hoping to achieve, and demonstrated strong attention to detail, noticing things like the slope of the floors and the fact that the recessed lights were out of alignment. He was quick to turn around a quote (some contractors took weeks; others required me to follow up multiple times), and was very responsive to my many emails regarding questions and concerns. I took the leap and hired him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17413"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17413 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Jamie_Bathroom-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start, working with Erion and his team was a delight. They showed up promptly at 9am each day, motivated and ready to begin work. And these guys worked hard! I swear, I barely saw them stop to eat! Construction debris and dust is part of the deal when you embark on a project like this, but Erion and his team were extremely tidy and took extra care to protect our house and hardwood floors. Even at the end of demo day, our house was surprisingly clean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of my experience with Erion was his openness to what I wanted and his tireless pursuit of making this a reality. I wanted a bright, clean, fresh, and timeless space—something that would age well with the house and provide a spa-like atmosphere. This bathroom has no natural light, so I made sure to choose materials that reflected light (beveled mirrors, polished nickel fixtures, high-gloss paint). Erion considered all my sourcing decisions, weighing in where I asked him to and letting me handle things everywhere else. I spent a lot of time researching the fixtures I wanted and although the approach was a bit piecemeal (and largely dictated by stores for which I had gift cards), it worked.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the tile we wanted to keep it light and clean and I worked with the lovely people at Ann Sacks. Their showroom is beautiful, pricing competitive, and customer service exceptional. On the bathroom floor, we chose large marble squares (16 x 16) with a honed finish because it’s not as slippery as polished marble and tends to show fewer scratches. We also decided to install radiant heat to keep our toes warm in winter. For the shower walls, I knew I wanted a larger tile (less grout to clean!) but something with a bit more character than subway tile. At first, I was unsure about going with a handmade 6 x 18 tile because each cut was slightly different, but in the end it turned out beautifully and the hand-made nature of the tile gave it a textured appearance that we absolutely love. As for the shower floors, we did a micro-mosaic which makes me happy every time I look down at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As unexpected challenges or issues arose—as they always do in remodeling—Erion handled them with a calm demeanor, thoroughly explaining my options and letting me know how they would affect factors such as time and cost. He would talk through the pros and cons of various options and together we would make a decision on how to move forward. At no point did I ever feel steamrolled, or like he was cutting corners. Erion demonstrated an exceptional dedication to quality and was just as concerned as I was that everything be done right and look good. The end result is a beautifully serene space and the sort of justification for all my time and anguish that I’d hoped for.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postscript: While writing this blog post, our apartment suffered severe water damage from a neighbor’s apartment. The silver lining in this situation is that we knew exactly who to call and who we could trust to do the work. Erion dropped everything to help us navigate this urgent situation, going above and beyond to help us triage damage and map a way forward. He has truly become our technical and professional liaison for maintaining and improving our largest investment, and the confidence I have in his practices, tastes, and commitment to quality cannot be overstated. Thank you, Sweeten, for connecting us.</span></p>
