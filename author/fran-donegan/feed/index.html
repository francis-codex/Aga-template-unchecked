<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated closet with open doors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MaggieAdam-bedroom-closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn&#8217;t that long ago when closets were merely places we kept the stuff we weren&#8217;t using at the moment.  And all those items—clothing, shoes, or jewelry—usually turned into a jumbled mess. A mess that had to be kept behind closed doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not anymore. Closets have evolved from storage areas to showplaces. Having order for day-to-day activities, while having attractive, practical space is key for a well-run home. Feeling inspired by Marie Kondo or The Home Edit? Sweeten is offering some basic tips on how to remodel your closet, with details on paring down, building back up, and getting organized. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to remodel your closet: Construction options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few ways you can go about getting your perfect closet. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>The DIY Option</strong> &#8211; You can design your own storage system, and then look for the products to outfit the space. There are brick-and-mortar retailers and online sources for premade storage systems. You will need to do the design, take the measurements, and install the system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Design a system with professional help</strong> &#8211; Go online and look for a company, such as <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/custom-closets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Container Store</a>, that lets you design a system with their help. They will then build your closet and send the rods, shelving, and other essential parts to you for installation. You can install it yourself, or hire someone to do it.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Use a full-service large closet company</strong> &#8211; You would deal with a local franchisee of a national firm like California Closets or Closets by Design. The designer will come to your home to help you organize your items. The designer will, with your input, create a closet design. The company&#8217;s factory will build the closet. Its installers will put it in place.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Use an independent closet company</strong> &#8211; These are local companies that provide the full-service closet experience. Some will custom build your closet. Others may source systems that will fill your needs.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each closet company will have its own installation method.  Some closet systems are installed on the floor. But others are attached to a hanging rail that is screwed to the wall studs at the back of the closet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Reorganize and pare down your closet</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter who does the actual design and installation, closet remodels consist of two parts: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Step 1: Organize items in the closet</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Step 2: Design an efficient storage system for the closet</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This works for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all types and sizes of closets</a>, from narrow entry hall closets to large walk-ins.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many, the initial organizing is the hardest part. Take a clothing closet, for example. Organizing begins by being adamant weeding out everything you don&#8217;t need or haven&#8217;t worn or used in years. That is often harder than it sounds, but there are ways to make it easier.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take everything out of the closet, and start forming piles:  </span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Pile #1 is for clothes you are going to keep because you wear them on a regular basis. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Piles #2 and #3 are for the discards. One pile should be <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a34301625/where-to-donate-clothes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clothes you will donate or give away</a>. The other pile </span><span class="s1">will be tossed in the trash because they are too damaged to give away. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the closet empty, make any improvements to the closet itself.  Clean the interior and floor of the closet. Repair any damage, add lighting if it does not exist, and give the interior a fresh coat of paint.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the clothes you are keeping and group like items together. This will give you an idea of how much space each type of clothing will need. You will realize which items to store on hangers and which to put on shelves or in drawers. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Create a closet storage plan</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that your possessions are assembled into items with purpose, you can store them in an efficient way. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Group like items together. Store shirts with shirts, dresses with dresses, etc.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Separate long-hanging items from short items. If you have a lot of short items, you can install two levels of hanging rods to use the space efficiently.  The double-hanging rod arrangement is one of the signatures of a custom closet.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Use drawers of different sizes and open, adjustable shelving for folded items. Flexibility is key here because you will need to store items of different sizes.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Arrange items from most used to least used. For a reach-in closet, place items you always use in the center. Place seldom-used things to the sides or on high shelves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make use of closet accessories. You can find jewelry inserts for drawers that not only store the valuables, they also display the jewelry. There are hanging and floor-mounted shoe racks that can accommodate regular shoes as well as tall boots. Make drawers more efficient by adding dividers that separate small items like belts and rolled-up socks. Use hangers designed for ties and scarves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Use matching accessories. To create a neat, fresh appearance, use matching hangers and storage boxes. The uniform look enhances the design of the closet.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add extras. If you have the room, include a full-length mirror and seating in walk-in closets.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Keep a step stool handy. Having a stool or small stepladder nearby will remind you to put away hard-to-reach items. This will help keep the closet neat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Choosing closet materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A closet remodel is meant to be seen as well as used. So you will have your choice of different finishes, materials, and colors. Closet companies offer a full range of products. Of course, quality finishes and materials will add to the cost, as will the size of the closet. A simple ready-made modular system for a small reach-in closet can cost under $200, plus installation. A tricked-out, customized walk-in can cost $4,000 or more. </span></p>
<h4>The closet door</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Including a new closet door enhances the experience of how you approach your closet daily. You can replace older doors with bifold doors or sliding barn doors. No matter what kind of door you use, don&#8217;t waste that valuable real estate. Additionally, you can use the back of any door for hanging items or a mirror. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A well-designed front porch is an important part of the home&#8217;s design. Plus, it serves a function; like a place to relax or a space for greeting visitors. Sadly, many porches don’t suit homeowners&#8217; needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is especially true of porches on older homes that have been remodeled in the past. Previous homeowners often selected design details that clashed with the character of the house. Some removed the front porch entirely, damaging the integrity of the home&#8217;s design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take note: Porches for historic houses need to be approved by the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s a good idea to list what you don&#8217;t like about the current porch. From this starting point for the front porch renovation, Sweeten outlines the path to building a structure that works with your lifestyle and the house&#8217;s architectural style.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How will you use the front porch?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porches are transition spaces between the outside world and home. At the same time, they are an extension of living space that is not quite inside or outside. Start your project by determining how you will use the porch space. Will it be a space to greet guests? Will it be a family gathering spot? Do you plan to eat on the porch?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your answers will help determine the features of the new porch. In the Washington DC area, a ceiling fan will make summer evenings more pleasant. The way the porch will be used also determines its size.  Importantly, not all porches extend across the entire front of the building. <strong>Want to estimate the space needed for renovating your front porch? </strong></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A covered entry for greeting guests or judging the weather before venturing outdoors can be about four feet deep.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Porches for relaxing and living on require more space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Comfortable seating requires a porch that is at least five feet from the wall of the house to the railing. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add a dining table and you will need a wider, or deeper, porch. There should be at least 36 inches from a dining chair to an obstruction, like the house&#8217;s wall. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To be comfortable when using the table, plan on a 10-foot-deep porch.</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Fitting the front porch with the house</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovating a front porch is done to enhance curb appeal.  A well-designed porch can certainly do that, whether it is a renovation or building a whole new structure. However, it&#8217;s important that the porch complement and contribute to the design of the house. It should not look tacked on.  This is especially important where the original porch was renovated in the past or removed altogether. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating or adding a porch to a period home requires a little research. You can take cues from similar houses in your neighborhood.  And there are historical references, including some online, that list period details. Local designers and contractors can also help get the details right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porch designs can relate to the house in a few ways, including using similar materials, roof style and architectural details. Matching roof styles, such as gable or hip roofs, will help the porch integrate with the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Match exterior materials</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wood frame houses usually have wood porches. Brick houses have brick or other masonry foundations. The roofing material on the porch should match the material on the house. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architectural details can be anything from moldings, decorative brackets and medallions, railings and banisters, and columns. The goal is to incorporate the house&#8217;s style characteristics into the porch design. For example, the trim style around the windows might be used for the fascia of the porch.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Using the correct style of front porch columns</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Columns not only support the roof, but they play an important role in porch design. The trick is to use columns that match the style of the house. A colonial home requires classical columns that are in proportion to the porch and house. A craftsman, or bungalow, house can have stone columns or columns that are clad with siding that matches the house. Also, columns should frame doors and windows. They should not be added where they block a window, for example. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Front porch railing design</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The right railing can make or break a porch design. Victorian homes usually have elaborate &#8220;gingerbread&#8221; type railings. Simple railings with clean lines work well with contemporary home designs.  Your own research and advice from experts can help you settle on the right railing system. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding a new front porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Placing a porch where one does not exist should follow the same design rules as renovating a front porch. But the process includes building everything from the foundation to the roof. You will be selecting materials for the flooring, ceiling, and railing that work with the original house. In addition, the porch space has to be in proportion to the original house. And that is important because a house and porch not in proportion will never look right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New porches planned for historic homes in Washington DC have special provisions. Basically, a new porch, as well as a renovated porch, must be historically accurate. Approval for changes come from the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) for Washington DC. It is best to check what is and is not allowed before spending too much time on the design process. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Expanding on the back porch</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back porches are another matter. There is a 20- or 25-foot setback from the rear property line, depending on location in Washington D.Cthe city. But you cannot build out beyond 10 feet from an adjoining house.  So if your back walls lines up with your neighbor&#8217;s, you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a 10-foot-deep back porch</a>. But if their wall or porch is five feet beyond your wall, you can build out 15 feet. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permits for porches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA is the body that issues building permits. The process from application to approval can take two to four months. DCRA circulates the permit application to a number of government agencies, including the Historic Preservation Division. Navigating the process is difficult. But an experienced designer or general contractor will handle the permit process for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DCRA will consider property setbacks in the process. In the front, you cannot build beyond an existing structure that is closest to the street. So if houses on your block have porches, you can build out to the porch nearest the street. </span></p>
<h4>Starting a front porch renovation</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering your own front porch renovation? Porches provide valuable living space, plus they can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhance the curb appeal</a> of a house. But remember—the design, whether a renovation or new construction,  should look like an extension of the main house.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to set realistic expectations on your client</span><span class="s1"> renovation timelines</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

<h3>What is aging in place design? What does accessible design mean?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To some, &#8220;<strong>aging in place&#8221;</strong> is a design term that means creating living spaces that are safe and accessible for people who want to stay in their homes and care for themselves as they grow older. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To others, the term <strong>&#8220;accessible design&#8221;</strong> or &#8220;living in place&#8221; is more applicable, as it means designing spaces that suit the needs of children and adults in one home. In both cases, the goal is to create living spaces that are, safe, accessible, and also make design sense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gives an overview of aging in place design costs, plus costs for accessible designs, and gives tips for when these designs can be beneficial to the family lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much does accessible design cost?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When part of a major renovation, the cost to include accessible techniques can be minor. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t necessarily need to cost more, they are just different,&#8221; said </span><span class="s3">Julie Schuster of <a href="https://www.jlsdesignstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Schuster Design Studio</a></span><span class="s1"> and is a certified living in place professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you are remodeling a kitchen you probably want under cabinet lighting. Why not upgrade slightly to add bright LED lights that are good for aging eyes?&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two approaches to accessible living spaces: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to suit the urgent needs of the homeowner. </b> A wheelchair user will need, among other things, wide doorways and hallways, and a curbless shower with a bench and grab bars. A family with young children may want night lights in the hallways, non-slip bathroom floor tiles, and anti-scald shower valves.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Remodel to make the design flexible for future improvements.</b> &#8220;It is important to learn the things that could crop up in the future and then design backward for them. I install blocking behind a shower wall while renovating, so grab bars or a built-in bench can be added later. Putting in the blocking does not add to the overall cost,&#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Kammi Reiss Design</span></a>.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor Aaro</span>n</a>, being flexible in design is key. In one condo project, they placed a removable panel in front of the kitchen sink so a wheelchair user can roll up to the sink for use. </span></p>
<h3>What does aging in place cost?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While many accessible design techniques have similar costs as any renovation project,  some projects do have an increased cost. For example, the combination of slippery surfaces and a wet setting in bathrooms often cause accidents, especially for people with mobility issues or poor eyesight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s a comparison from the <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 Cost vs. Value Report</a> that compares a standard  5-foot by 7-foot bathroom of mid-range quality to an accessible one of the same size. The accessible bathroom includes 36-inch-wide doors, flat panel electric switches installed at sitting level, walk-in curbless shower with fold-out seat, adjustable shower head, thermostatic mixing valve, LED lighting, ceramic tile walls with contrasting color stripes, towel bars (grab bars) that can support 250 pounds each, night lights, and reconfigured storage accessible to someone in a seated position, among other items.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an example of what universal design can recoup at resale at a national level.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Costs $24,424 recouping 60% at resale</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Standard universal design remodel: Costs $38,813 recouping 58% at resale</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;<i>Remodeling</i> asked us to revise the remodeling project for them,&#8221; said Louie Delaware, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Living in Place Institute</span></a>. &#8220;Everyone assumed that it would cost much more and would not be worth as much.&#8221;  While there are increased costs, the return on investment is similar to that of the accessible bathroom. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for accessible design projects:</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some estimated costs for common projects often associated with accessible designs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Entrance ramp: $1,300 to $ 3,500<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Door widening to accommodate wheelchairs: $400 to $800, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Chair lift: $3,000 to $6,000, curved stairs will cost more<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Widening hallways (often includes moving plumbing, heating and cooling and electrical lines):  $500 to $2,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Grab bars with decorative finishes: $100 to $200, each<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curbless showers: $2,000 to $8,000<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Faucets with lever controls: $200 to $400<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the techniques used in accessible design or aging in place design are the same, whether planning for yourself, someone who wants to age in place, or to suit the needs of a growing family. The goal is to create a safe, accessible design for everyone to enjoy.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Estimating overhead and profit are important parts of any project bid. However, underestimating overhead costs on a project often cuts into the profit. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how to manage the cost of your business within a renovation project estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h4>How does Sweeten work with general contractors?</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Contractors pay only when they win a project. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 1: Estimating Overhead</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Indirect overhead</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ongoing, or indirect, overhead items keep a business running long term.  There are a number of indirect or ongoing costs. These may include: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Salaries and benefits for employees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Office costs, such as rent, utilities, supplies<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vehicle costs<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Insurance<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Marketing costs, including Sweeten fees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Professional services including accountants, attorneys<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Software licenses<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of these expenses as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; as they allow you to get in the game and operate a successful business. For that reason, many general contractors spread these costs evenly over a number of projects by incorporating them into their overhead and categorizing them as marketing. Others build it into their overhead on a project to project basis. It’s a key decision a contractor needs to make when they’re running their business. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a personal decision! The important point is to treat these fees as business expenses, and not as a reduction in profit. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead costs are costs for specific projects. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Equipment rental<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Job site utilities<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Additional insurance, when required<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Manpower for non-labor charges, such as accepting deliveries and ordering materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Project marketing expenses</span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">For example, the fees for Sweeten’s services provide </span><span class="s4">business development and marketing, opportunities for free photography/blog and social media promotion, peace of mind, and consumer protections for clients that are designed to help our GCs win.</span><span class="s3"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Include anything that does not fall under materials or labor that affects the project.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 2: </span><span class="s1">Presenting P and O Estimates</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some contractors lump profit and overhead costs together. However, separating the two offers an opportunity for the contractor. Most clients don&#8217;t understand the expenses of running a business. Many people assume the profit and overhead number is mostly profit—and they will try to get the GC to reduce it. Separate the two, and it could lead to a better understanding of what is behind the estimate. It explains the cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One helpful strategy is to list some of the overhead items that benefit the client.  They will appreciate the transparency and help them understand what they’re paying for. Offering this could separate the contractor from other firms bidding on the project. The client should know if the GC will purchase more insurance or special equipment to make the project successful. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 3: </span><span class="s1">Estimating Profits</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many GC&#8217;s use a standard profit percentage for their renovation project estimates. </span><span class="s4">It is a fairly common practice for GCs to increase or decrease the percentage based on different job factors. A contractor might reduce their profit margins if it looks like the project will run very smoothly. Perhaps a client already has materials on-site, so changes or delays due to delivery issues are unlikely. Some of Sweeten&#8217;s GCs will give a small discount on profit to lock in the job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the reverse is also true! Projects that appear more difficult for some reason. For example, projects where the clients have a difficult time making decisions and you anticipate delays.  Those types might include a higher profit margin in the bid. This will give you a cushion to fall back on when problems crop up. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 4: </span><span class="s1">Change Orders and Options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes happen on many projects. Account for your cost by including profit and overhead items in the change order procedure. Above all, be sure to be upfront with this practice in the initial contract you sign with the client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same is true if options, or add-ons, are included in the estimate. Include the profit and overhead in the renovation project estimate for the add-on. In those cases, the profit and overhead are combined with the estimated costs. </span></p>
<h5>Beat the competition with fair, profitable renovation project estimates</h5>
<p>We hope our guide to adding profit and overhead costs to your renovation project estimates was helpful! Knowing how to do this strategically is a crucial step in growing your contracting business.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More and more designers, contractors and homeowners believe that one of the best ways to make a bold design statement is to opt for wallpaper over paint. It provides hundreds of looks and textures that a regular paint job can&#8217;t match. And while more expensive than traditional paint,  wallpaper is usually less expensive than hiring a painter to create a decorative surface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, </span><span class="s2">shows why this covering is gaining in popularity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improved techniques</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although wallpaper has been around for years, there are a few reasons for its resurgence in popularity.  For one, people who grew up with it in their homes may have soured on it, but thanks to new printing and manufacturing techniques, manufacturers are producing dozens of new colors, designs, and textures, sparking a renewed appreciation for the product.  &#8220;Wallpaper has become much more interesting, &#8221; said Sweeten designer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tina. &#8220;It&#8217;s not your grandmother&#8217;s wallpaper anymore. Even if you are going for a minimalist look, a textured wallpaper adds so much more than flat paint to a room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners are increasingly asking for wallpaper in their homes. Tina tells how one of her clients already had wallpaper picked out for one of the rooms before they even met to discuss the project. &#8220;People are much more receptive than they used to be,&#8221; said Tina &#8221; One reason may be that they see so many design ideas on the internet where in the past you could only see ideas in magazines. There was no option to see the world quickly.&#8221; </span></p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Jessica + Alex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">textured wallcovering</a>; Brooke + Sam added <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor-to-ceiling patterns</a> to both bathrooms</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the types of designs that are getting noticed include 3D papers where the design seems to pop off of the wall, gradient papers where the colors and designs transition from floor to ceiling, metal looks, and geometric shapes. Custom printed options are also available. There are services that allow you to upload a photo or some other design you&#8217;ve created and have it turned into wallpaper.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where to use wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most designers use it in the main living areas: living room, dining room, and bedrooms. Some use it on an accent wall to make a bold statement. Others cover all of the walls, some even use it on ceilings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The use of wallpaper in bathrooms is a matter of contention among designers and contractors. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to use it in full bathrooms because of the moisture problems,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Ilya. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen people put it in the shower area. I personally would not do that.&#8221; It should be noted that some wallpapers are designed for use in high-moisture areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ilya has used wallpaper in powder rooms. In a recent remodel in Red Hook, the client &#8220;chose a bold print wallpaper that brings the whole space to life,&#8221; he said. The wallpaper has a white background with a large green floral print. The powder room has matte back accessories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Designer Tina does not use it in bathrooms because she prefers to utilize tile that runs up to the ceiling. &#8220;But I do like it in powder rooms to create a jewel-box effect,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Working with wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason for the increased popularity is that today&#8217;s products are easier to work with than older versions. &#8220;It&#8217;s still an art form to hang wallpaper correctly,&#8221; said Ilya. &#8220;But it is easier than it used to be and it is also easier to match patterns.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the product, wallpaper comes prepasted, and soaking the sheets in water activates the adhesive. Another method is to apply adhesive to the paper or directly to the wall. Spreading adhesive on the wall tends to be less messy than brushing it on the back of the paper and then transferring the sheet to the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many papers are listed as strippable or peelable, meaning it is easy to get them off of the walls when it is time for a change. Ilya says that when you do remove the wallpaper, it is necessary to skim coat the walls before painting. If new wallpaper is called for, you should remove all of the old adhesive and prime the wall. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of wallpaper</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wallpaper is made from a number of materials, but some form of vinyl is the most common. The material is durable, easy to keep clean, and many vinyl papers are easy to remove. There are a number of products that contain vinyl in some way.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Solid vinyl &#8211; This thick paper consists of a solid layer of vinyl laminated to a paper or fabric substrate. This is the most durable of vinyl-containing products.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated fabric &#8211; Liquid vinyl coats a fabric base, making the paper breathable.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vinyl coated paper &#8211; A liquid coating is applied to a paper base. These papers are easy to clean and remove, but not as durable as a solid vinyl paper.<br />

			<h2>Increasing accessibility is a must for those growing older at home</h2>

<h3>Comfortable living for young and older family members</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to undertake a major renovation project. Not the least of which is to make the space safer and more accessible to those living there.</p>
<h4>What is aging in place remodeling?</h4>
<p>The aging in place design concept puts into practice products and techniques that will allow people to live in their homes as they grow older.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of aging in place is fabulous because you stay healthier when you are able to live in your own home, &#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href="https://www.kammireissdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kammi Reiss Design</a>.</p>
<h4>What is the Living in Place concept?</h4>
<p>The concept shifts when taking other household members into account such as young couples with families. When it comes to designing a more functional home for young people, &#8220;no one wants to talk about aging,&#8221; said Natalia Pierce of <a href="https://detailbydesign.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Details by Design</a> and a Certified Living in Place Professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you try to have that discussion with someone who is 35, it is not even on their radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livinginplace.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living in Place Institute</a> promotes safe and adaptable building techniques for everyone—of all ages—who may live in the house and certifies professionals in those techniques.</p>
<p>We speak with professionals involved with accessible design. It is clear that the difference between the two approaches is fairly narrow, which means there is a lot of overlap in design and construction approaches. Techniques and products that help an older person take care of themselves work fine for younger people, too. In fact, those techniques are just smart and universal designs that all <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors can execute.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg" alt="tub to shower conversion with white subway tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47288" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mickey-Apt-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Planning ahead for retirement, Sweeten homeowner Mickey renovated his <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom shower</a> to assist with future limited mobility.</p>
<h3>Universal design general guidelines</h3>
<p>Accessible design can take many forms. And some techniques will not work in all situations. Most people recognize the entrance ramp as the symbol for this type of design. If you rely on a wheelchair or scooter or use a walker to get around and live in a detached house, ramps make your life a lot easier. But if you are renovating a third-floor condo, a ramp may not be an option.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most accessible approaches are fairly intuitive and easy to accomplish. &#8220;We tell <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors</a> to keep doing what they have been doing, but just do it a little differently,&#8221; said Erik Listou, co-founder of the Living in Place Institute. &#8220;If you are going to install a handrail on a stair, put one on both sides. It&#8217;s much safer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Here are some general tips for universal design:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Install adequate lighting—As people age, they tend to require brighter lights throughout the home. Light levels should be constant because it takes some people longer to adjust when moving from bright to dark areas. &#8220;We install electrical outlet covers with nightlights in them,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a>. &#8220;They work for everyone, and they help guide the way safely when someone needs to use the bathroom at night.&#8221;</li>
<li>Create contrasts when levels change, especially on stairs. &#8220;If you are going down the stairs and the surfaces of the steps all look the same, you may not tell where one step ends,&#8221; said Kammi. &#8220;A light above the stairs can cast shadows to show the edge of the step.&#8221; Stairs with contrasting color edges or traction strips are other safe options.</li>
<li>Upgrade doorways—All doors, including interior doors, should be at least 36 inches wide to accommodate a wheelchair. The door hardware should be levers rather than knobs, which are difficult for some older people, as well as young children, to use.</li>
<li>Embrace the smart home—There are a number of devices that can be controlled from a smartphone, tablet, or home computer. Some systems allow the user to adjust the thermostat, lock doors, and turn lights on and off. There are even systems that will send out an alert if the water heater is leaking. Video doorbells let those inside see who is at the door without opening it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aging in place remodeling in the kitchen</h3>
<p>Kitchens offer a number of opportunities to incorporate safe universal designs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabinets—Typical kitchen design can pose a problem for people who have trouble reaching above their heads or bending to get into a base cabinet. Pull-down shelves for wall cabinets and pull-out drawers for base cabinets make them more accessible.</li>
<li>Sinks—Someone in a wheelchair or scooter needs to be able to pull up under the sink to use it. &#8220;On one of our projects, we installed removable panels at the sink, &#8221; said <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Robert who works with Sweeten contractor Aaron.</span> </span>&#8220;If they need to in the future, they can remove the panel and roll up under the sink.&#8221; All plumbing should be equipped with levers rather than knobs. Faucets with no-touch operation are another option.</li>
<li>Appliances—Some codes require a five-foot diameter turning radius in front of refrigerators for wheelchair users. If that is not an option, Kammi likes French-door refrigerators. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to back away very far when you open part of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can also put the things you use the most often on one side of the door.&#8221; Kammi also believes that microwaves should be placed at counter or below counter height. &#8220;That way everyone can use it—the child who wants to pop in his chicken nuggets or the grandmother who wants to heat up their coffee.&#8221;</li>
<li>Counters—A matte finish will create less glare than a counter with a glossy finish, especially when there are under-cabinet lights in place. A contrasting edge treatment can help someone with poor eyesight distinguish the edge of the counter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aging in place bathroom design</h3>
<p>Because of the combination of wet, slippery surfaces found in bathrooms, the rooms can be dangerous for someone with limited mobility or some other impairment. Fortunately, many of the items described below have evolved in design as well as function. They do not have an &#8220;institutional&#8221; look. There are towel bars, soap dishes, toilet paper holders, and other accessories that are grab-bar rated, meaning they can support the weight of an average adult. They are available in finishes that match other bathroom fixtures. Some key elements of aging in place remodeling include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the right location—If possible, install a bathroom on the first floor large enough so that a wheelchair can maneuver around easily.</li>
<li>Install showers—The best option is a roll-in, or barrier-free shower—one with no curb—that is equipped with grab bars and a built-in bench. &#8220;Barrier-free showers not only look awesome, but they are also just better and safer,&#8221; said Natalia.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35992 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="aging in place bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Cicely-Mulcare-Bathroom-07-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Daughters <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/senior-friendly-bathroom-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added a bathroom</a> to the ground floor of their house for their mother</span></p>
<h4>Showers &amp; bathtubs for aging-in-place bathrooms</h4>
<p>Both Kammi and Sweeten contractor Aaron said that even if the clients don&#8217;t want grab bars or built-in benches, they always install wood blocking behind the shower walls so that the grab bars can be added easily later.</p>
<p>A hand-held shower head with anti-scald valves prevents burns when the water pressure changes. &#8220;Even if you are fully mobile, suppose you have an accident and break your leg? The hand-held shower head and shower bench will come in handy,&#8221; said Kammi.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flooring—Slip-resistant floor tiles make everyone&#8217;s time in the bathroom safer.</li>
<li>Aging in place toilets—A seat extender on a standard toilet makes it easier for people with mobility problems to use. New toilets should be listed as compliant with the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act.</li>
<li>Sinks—Wall-hung sinks allow someone in a wheelchair to roll right up to basin. Kammi designed a bathroom with double sinks. One has a vanity beneath it; the other is open with a removable panel so that someone in a wheelchair can use it easily. When it is not in use an attractive bench sits in front of the sink, &#8220;making it look like a choice to have the bench under the sink cabinet,&#8221; she said.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to start thinking about aging in place remodeling</h3>
<p>Although most of her younger clients do not think in terms of accessibility, it is important to Kammi and other designers to incorporate it into their projects. &#8220;No one asks for it,&#8221; Kammi said, &#8220;but when designing I must consider it.&#8221; If attractive design and the easing of physical limitations can complement each other, it may be worth taking into account for when you might need it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Mastering the renovation sales process: How to create trust with a client and deal with unresponsiveness</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47748 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The process of signing a new client contains multiple steps. In addition to finding the client, you, as the contractor, have to find out the client&#8217;s budget, the scope that they want to accomplish, and when they want to start the project. Knowing these details will help determine if your firm and the client are a good fit. After that comes client meetings, estimates, and the closing. Sweeten has put together this renovation sales process guide that covers each of these phases.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> prequalifies clients for contractors, which is often the most difficult step. Sweeten’s process puts homeowners with projects in touch with the right contractor. So, when you come on board, the process of identifying possible clients is already done for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches <a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Additionally, contractors pay only when they win a project. Sweeten project budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h3>What to do at client meetings</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to continue the sales process. Many contractors set up a meeting with the client. At the meeting, they go over the details of the project. <strong>Many contractors find these items useful to bring up at the first meeting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of the project</li>
<li>The reason for the renovation</li>
<li>The client&#8217;s timeline for the project</li>
<li>The budget</li>
<li>Reasons your firm is a good match for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting is a discussion that gives you a chance to engage with and draw out the client. Whether you meet in person initially or you have a quick call to see if you are on the same page, it is important that you be direct with the client regarding their desired timeline for the job. This will help you figure out if the client is serious or just exploring options. It will also help you develop a strategy for following up with the client.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to show you are their partner in the project. Most homeowners respond well to positive remarks from the contractor. If they want to start in six weeks, tell them what needs to be done to meet that date, or get close to it. Your positive attitude can give the client confidence in you. And it can help move the project along.</p>
<h3>Preparing the estimate</h3>
<p>Homeowners will expect a project estimate from you sooner rather than later. In fact, homeowners expect the estimate within a week or so. By telling the homeowners when they should expect the estimate, you can manage their expectations and set up a clear next checkpoint.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have questions about the estimates they receive. Many successful contractors like to set up a phone or in-person meeting to go over the estimate. Proposing a meeting for a week or two after supplying the estimate should give the homeowners time to go over it on their own. Besides answering questions, this meeting gives you a chance to reconfirm the timeline and the budget. Plus, it&#8217;s an opportunity for more client contact (which is always a good thing!)</p>
<p>Getting the estimate to the client quickly gives time for revisions. This is especially important for clients who expect a quick start to the project.</p>
<h3>Clients who won&#8217;t commit</h3>
<p>Everyone has experienced clients who drag their feet once they have the estimate. This is where your earlier conversations with the client can pay off. Knowing their timeline allows you to show your expertise and help move the process along. One way to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remind them that to meet their deadline, items need to be ordered now or in the near future.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some clients will stop communicating with the contractor completely. It&#8217;s frustrating! But if you have done your job up to this point, there is nothing wrong with asking point-blank questions. For example, you can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Do you want to continue with the project?&#8221; </strong></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Are you still considering my firm?&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Yes” answers to those questions will move the project along. No one wants to hear a no, but at least a “no” answer means you can stop wasting your time and focus on other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>To help with difficult clients, Sweeten has a team that keeps in contact with the clients. They can help you get answers to those questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The payoff to the steps above is to get the client to commit, so you can finally start the renovation process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a passive house design can achieve top-notch energy efficiency</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32316 size-chrono" title="white-farmhouse-exterior" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg" alt="white farmhouse exterior with blue sloping roof after renovation" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;ve heard the term &#8220;passive home&#8221; to describe a home that needs almost no help from HVAC equipment to heat or cool itself. Its temperature and comfort are adjusted via passive rather than active mechanical systems. For example, it might have large south-facing windows next to a room with a floor of dark stones that absorb the sun&#8217;s heat and retain it for hours to produce warmth in the winter, and sophisticated shading to keep the stones, and the room, cool in the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building or renovating using passive house principles can reduce energy costs by 80 to 90 percent when compared with standard buildings—saving the owners money, reducing the carbon footprint of the building, and making the house more comfortable. That&#8217;s good news!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path to reaching those savings calls for professionals with expertise in building techniques that are more exacting and often different from standard practices. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and architects, offers an overview of achieving maximum home efficiency and comfort when it comes to construction.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Certified passive house techniques</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These projects start with designs that are geared to the local climate. Sophisticated computer models are used in an attempt to get energy use down near zero. Here are elements that are common to new construction and renovation projects:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super insulation</span>: Passive houses contain much more insulation than standard houses. Where a standard well-insulated house may have R-38 in the ceiling, passive houses routinely have R-49 to 80. Walls can have R-40 or higher. (The R-value refers to the ability of insulation to resist heat flow; the higher the number, the better the insulation.) To reach those levels in a brownstone while preserving the look of the exterior, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Isaac</a> says contractors must add new framing inside the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tight construction</span>: Buildings using this technique are extremely airtight, so there is very little infiltration of outside air or loss of inside air that has been heated or cooled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High-performance windows and doors</span>: While double-glazed windows are the most common energy-efficient windows used in standard construction, triple-glazed windows with energy-efficient coatings are common here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ventilation systems</span>: Because the buildings are so airtight, mechanical ventilation is necessary to control moisture levels and maintain good air quality. The systems contain energy-recovery systems so that outgoing air can either heat or cool incoming fresh air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solar gain</span>: Windows are sized and oriented so that they can use the sun&#8217;s energy for heating in the winter. Roof overhangs help shade windows during the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, expect costs to be about 10 to 15 percent higher than standard renovation costs. Fortunately, the high-tech materials and techniques usually mean smaller heating and cooling units can be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;But passive home is about more than just energy efficiency,&#8221; said Isaac. &#8220;When you step into a passive house, it is very quiet. If you are not getting air from outside, you are not getting much sound, either. And because the air is filtered, it is very clean. It ends up being a nice way to live.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retrofitting your home</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most passive house designs are new construction, but renovations can retrofit an existing apartment or house. These types of remodels require a full-scale commitment to saving energy. Most are complete gut-to-the-exterior-walls projects to accommodate high insulation levels and other passive house techniques. EnerPhit is the certification program for retrofit renovations, and the requirements are less stringent than those for new construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32344 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW-723x467.jpg" alt="passive house" width="723" height="467" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Townhouses and brownstones are good candidates,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Isaac, who has been involved with passive renovations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. &#8220;They have these massive walls all around and there are usually other houses on either side, so there is already an advantage in controlling heating and cooling.&#8221; In addition, basements in a brownstone are so packed into the city infrastructure, little heat is lost into the ground. Focus on the roof and the short, exposed end walls of the house. Complete a home&#8217;s energy efficiency with triple-paned windows, a lot of insulation, and air sealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For individual apartments within a larger building, “you can build an airtight envelope around your unit and make it separate from the outside and the rest of the building,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. “Pack in as much insulation as you can and wrap up the apartment all the way around.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may encounter problems with building regulations if you want to make changes to the outside of the building, such as installing high-performance windows that don’t match what is already there. The same applies to buildings with landmark status. Anthony says that in theory, custom covers to hide the window frames might be a solution. This would have to be worked out with the condo or co-op board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the standalone house, all four sides of the house, the attic, and the basement need to be considered. A building—high on insulation and low on air leakage—creates a strong building envelope. All windows should be swapped out. Outfit the attic and roof with a ton of insulation which works out if the roof needs to be replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost is high in the short term but many people consider it worth it. Some homeowners do deep energy retrofits to existing houses—a big step towards passive house—but hits the sweet spot financially. A substantial amount of money will be saved on heating and cooling costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A homeowner can use just about any passive house technique because EnerPhit is a performance standard that depends on how the house performs overall, not how individual components perform. “If you can make the envelope extremely airtight, you may be able to compensate if the windows are a problem,&#8221; explained Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>The story behind passive house</strong></p>
<p>While passive building is becoming more popular, it&#8217;s not entirely new. Its concepts were used as far back as the 1980s in the U.S. The ideas were refined and honed in Germany and other parts of Europe and the movement regained momentum here in the past 15 or so years.</p>
<p>A number of international, national, and local organizations have formed—there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.nypassivehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Passive House</a> association and the <a href="https://www.phius.org/home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passive House Institute US</a>, which conduct research, write standards, and certify architects, contractors, and other professionals. Third-party certification ensures the building will save the amount of energy predicted by the original design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When compared with the overall building and renovation industries, projects using passive house concepts make up a small percentage of the whole. But as more and more people become aware of the benefits, products and building techniques used will no doubt make their way into the standard construction practice in a bigger way.</p>
