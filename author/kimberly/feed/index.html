<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovation of a Clinton Hill kitchen for entertaining and storage<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
<strong>Before</strong></span>: A<span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen renovation was some time in the making f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or Sarah, who works in finance, and Becky, who works for a media company. Sarah had been living in the one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops since 2010 (with Becky joining her in 2013) and had her sights set on overhauling the kitchen from the get-go. A previous renovation had tiled-off the kitchen, chopping up the open living space and giving guests a clunky raised border to trip over. White appliances and heavy cabinetry were outdated, and the kitchen’s generous square footage wasn’t all that functional for hosting or entertaining. After seeing successful Sweeten rehabs featured on <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/search?q=SWEETEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy</a>, Sarah <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3621%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her renovation project to Sweeten</a>. “It seemed like an easy solution for such a risky kind of decision,” she said. The couple was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</span></p>

Thankfully, their contractor was up for anything. “He’s really a nice guy, super trustworthy and very patient,” Sarah said. “He was willing to wait throughout that time while I was redesigning things.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new plan was worth the hold-up: they would tear out the L-line of cabinetry and use multiple variations on open and closed storage on each of the walls and in a central island. Plus, they geared up to create a new entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connecting the kitchen to the hallway, improving the flow around the apartment.</span></p>

Her original vision paired the white stone composite with gray cabinets, but after looking through Ikea photo pairings, a warmer, walnut-inspired wood started to feel like a better match.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HJHiUiD4Kw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="lowest-bid-video-link-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40749 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg" alt="video link image of should i take the lowest bid by sweeten founder" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give the Ikea base cabinetry some added oomph, Sarah chose custom doors from Semihandmade. Semihandmade also provided coordinating custom paneling for the new island—a gorgeous detail with the stark white waterfall countertop. The island’s added storage freed Becky and Sarah to be more adventurous with other cabinetry choices. They skipped an upper line of cabinets on the most visible wall and went with slim open shelving made from recycled wood. White globe pendants and sconces are anchored on an intricate porcelain backsplash tile; the tile’s folded paper-style pattern adds another level of visual detail in barely-there-beige. </span></p>

The summer-long process paused when the cabinets beat the doors’ arrival by a few weeks, and delivery of a few additional custom pieces dragged until January. Her advice to future renovators: temper your eagerness to get started, knowing that your patience will pay off with a more reasonable timeline (and with all of your packages in place). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sarah and Becky didn’t love hiding out in their bedroom for a good part of the summer, the new cohesive kitchen was worth it. The couple didn’t just survive they process—they thrived: Sarah and Becky recently got engaged! “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah with a laugh.</span></p>
<p><em>Thanks, Sarah and Becky, for sharing your Clinton Hill kitchen renovation with us!</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The kitchen floor now matches the rest of the apartment’s original tongue and groove parquet—thanks to the contractor&#8217;s painstaking work to cut and stain new flooring to match the original (and no longer available) planks.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people approach a kitchen renovation with big enthusiasm and boundless energy &#8212; hours of anticipation, research, pinning, and hunting devoted to a major undertaking. Brooklynite Laura is not one of those people. When Laura decided it was finally time to overhaul the 1950s kitchen of her Windsor Terrace co-op, she took on the project with complete pragmatism. After renovating the kitchen of a prior home and watching the process drag and get buried in minutiae, Laura had no interest in obsessing over decisions—she wanted a contractor who could help her bring the kitchen into this millennium while explicitly guiding her on what was needed and when.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/lauras-kitchen-renovation-sweeten-in-windsor-terrace/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16203 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/laura-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation brooklyn" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/laura-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/laura-kitchen-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura lived in her two-bedroom, two-bath co-op for about five years before taking on the old-school kitchen. The kitchen’s footprint gave her a good bit of storage space, but the floor was shot and only looked serviceable in the five minutes after it was mopped. Laura had real affection for the original stove (complete with warming oven), but an update was clearly in order. After hearing positive things about </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a renovation-obsessed friend, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her renovation</a></strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and we matched her with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who had also worked on that same friend’s home.</span><span id="more-15844"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15833" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura had ambitious plans to carve out a pantry from space in the dining room, but Kris explained that the move might be too expensive. Instead, they worked together to create a plan that would be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">structurally identical to what was already there—but vastly improved. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am someone who cannot read an architect’s drawing. The details of all the things that you are expected to keep track of, down to buying knobs for the cabinets, just drove me crazy,” Laura said. “I wanted the contractor to take care of as much as possible.” And so Kris did. He started by creating a plan that she could read and then set to work installing custom maple cabinets, translucent subway backsplash tiles, and a cheery aqua paint finish to brighten the room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura chose sturdy granite countertops and Kris added a new corner built-in along with open shelving above to stash cookbooks—ending a habit of running to the study anytime Laura wanted to check a recipe. Neutral ceramic floor tiles ensure Laura won’t have to mop often for the kitchen to look its best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire renovation cost about $35,000, with no big surprises thanks to Kris and his straightforward plan. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kris was so efficient that the project initially came in under budget, so he was able to slip in some targeted updates in the bathroom and still keep the total budget on track. He replaced delightfully pink-and-white (but badly damaged) tiles with extra floor tiles from the kitchen and re-tiled the walls with simple white subway tile and high-contrast dark grout. Kris removed a throwback wall-mounted laundry shoot and added a new sink, mirror, and vanity light fixture &#8211; all within Laura’s original budget! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process rolled along smoothly, minus a snowstorm that delayed the speedy six-week schedule by exactly one day. Laura credits the truncated schedule to slotting her soup-to-nuts demolition in the dead of winter and to Kris. “Kris was very good about letting me know what needed to be done and when it needed to be done,” Laura said. “I didn’t wind up with things I couldn’t use or make mistakes, which is what I was afraid of.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura’s best advice for those renovating? Don’t listen to all the advice! While people might pressure you to go to a dozen granite places or endlessly fixate on light fixtures, there’s no need to go overboard. “I think you can do this without being a fanatic about that stuff, as long as you have a sort of basic idea of what you want.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Evelyn, Manhattan homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After living in NYC for nearly 10 years, I realized it might be time to put on my grown-up girl shoes, build some solid roots, and pay a mortgage rather than just renting. I remember asking my real estate agent how people usually knew which place to buy. He simply said you just know. He was right. It took a few months of looking and just as I was feeling my most disheartened, I stepped into what would be my converted studio and I KNEW this was going to be my home. And we lived happily ever after.</span><span id="more-15737"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while I did love my new home on sight, it was not without its imperfections. For a co-op building that has been around for over 90 years, it was in wonderful shape, well-maintained and in a fantastic Upper West Side neighborhood. I can’t say I had much to complain about&#8230; and yet, when I first searched for an apartment, I had two basic requirements. I wanted a workable kitchen that was hopefully separated from the rest of the living space, and I wanted a decent bathroom. Luckily, both requirements were fulfilled, but there was room for improvement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen, while adorable and full of storage, wasn’t conducive to major cooking spurts. The dishwasher had leaking issues—temperamental is a good way to describe it. The floor had cracks. The counter space was limited and only one person could move at a time in there. There were these wonderful glass cabinets that were attached to each end of the galley kitchen. While I appreciated the storage and display possibilities, the awkward height and width just ended up making my kitchen seem smaller. As for my bathroom, it just needed some updating. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loathe cleaning and wanted a home that was easy to care for but tailored to my particular needs. I wanted to bring my kitchen up to the modern age but maintain a bit of that retro vibe. For me, after months of aspirational pinning on Pinterest, that meant a black and white kitchen (stark black and stark white) with pops of color.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15771" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen_Before-01-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen_Before-01-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen_Before-01-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen_Before-01-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a false start with my renovation a few years ago. I talked with some contractors referred to me by friends, but I wasn’t in the right space financially or mentally to deal with a renovation. Fast forward two to three years later, and it was now or never. Once again, I had no idea how to begin. But hurrah for the internet! I googled various NY contractor sites and found Sweeten.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What appealed to me most about Sweeten was the matching system. I </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted what I wanted</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and contractors found me. I could read up on them and see their previous work. It made a daunting task less so. In my case, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Jon</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t one that was matched with me. I was browsing the site, noticed his work, and emailed Sweeten to see if they could match us. When I first met Jon, I felt at ease. He was smart, had great ideas, and understood the type of vibe I was going for. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My budget was decent but nothing too crazy. I spent a weekend at IKEA figuring out my game plan. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest decisions for any kitchen are the cabinets. I chose the whitest, glossiest cabinets at IKEA. Even on the sunniest of days, my apartment doesn’t have a lot of natural light. I figured making my kitchen as white as possible would help to make at least part of my home bright—I was right. The glossy finish was practical; it’s easier to clean. When it comes to the interiors, I was quite captivated by drawers. In all the places I’ve lived, drawers had never been much of an option, other than the utensil drawer. Seeing the various ways in which I could get my mixing bowls out by pulling out a drawer instead of digging into the back of a cabinet was revolutionary! I wanted as many drawers as possible, and definitely a pull-out trash bin.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15764" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen black and white floor tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I had many ideas, the actual execution (measurements, what would actually work versus what I wanted) was a bit out of my realm. Luckily Jon was great with all of that. He would shoot me ideas or measurements of what I needed to look for. I would send him the appliances, etc., and he would assess if it was the correct size or not (yay for teamwork!). Because I do have a NYC kitchen, full-size appliances were not in the cards. I opted for a taller refrigerator (European-sized if you will, with freezer drawers on the bottom), compact dishwasher, and a much deeper sink (got that from Amazon, 10” deep). With the measurements in mind, I was also able to find a really good-sized but still compact-ish oven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to stay sensible with my appliances. I went for solid brands but didn’t go big on the pricing. My splurges were contained to unexpected accessories. The favorite splurge is my Kartell light blue lamp (which was actually recommended by Jon—excellent taste). I also went a little lavish for my floor. I knew I wanted larger-scale black and white tiles set in a diamond pattern, but nearly every tile store insisted the white tile could never be the pure white I wanted. I was considering options I could settle for when I luckily stumbled upon a really knowledgeable salesperson. He explained that pure white tile would be an issue if I went with porcelain or ceramic—but he did have one other option: glass. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve my desired look, he recommended glass for the white and granite for the black. My previous floor was prone to damage if anything fell; this dream floor would not have that issue, plus the tile is super glossy to boot. Perfect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To complete the stark black and white effect, I decided on white subway tiles and a black countertop. With my aversion to cleaning, a black quartz countertop would hide messes a bit easier. Initially I thought I would do granite, as everyone is wont to do, but I like that quartz is more low maintenance and also more uniform in color and tone (since it’s not a natural stone). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest transformations was the addition of my window seat, one of Jon’s ideas from our initial meeting. Previously, there was a radiator in that space, but, in all the years in my apartment, I never used it. With the window seat complete with open shelving below, wasted space became not only a place to sit but I could have more storage. While Jon suggested paneling to disguise the shelving, I opted to keep it open. I prefer the open shelving as a great way to display some of my colorful kitchen accessories, cookbooks, and other knickknacks. I was excited by the idea of a window seat, but I did not expect the vibrancy, coziness, and warmth it brings to my new kitchen. I absolutely adore it!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My bathroom was less of a dramatic change but the tweaks made were very much needed. Initially, I had wanted a super blue floor. After discovering that was an impossible ask, I left it to Jon’s discretion. He sent me some options and I went for a less crazy but still lovely blue-gray slate. The tiles were huge (love that) and it’s easy to clean.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides the tile, I knew I needed to upgrade the shelving above my toilet. When I first moved in, I installed a cheap cabinet from Bed Bath and Beyond. Very functional, as I had very little space, but it was just…there. After exploring some ideas, I went for open shelving. I found this great wooden shelf from West Elm that we cut in half. The brackets holding up the shelving were not exactly my favorite. I wanted something unobtrusive more in-line with my aesthetic. I had shown Jon a picture of an idea but didn’t really think much about getting that exact look. But to my surprise, he found a perfect facsimile, if not something better. Basically, they were just old pipes that were upcycled as shelving brackets. And they look fantastic.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, I am wildly happy with the results. The renovation itself was LOTS of work but suffice to say, what I learned was immense. Having had no idea where to even begin, Sweeten really made a very scary, life-changing task seem less daunting. With so much information and helpful service, I was to find the perfect contractor for me to execute my dream. And were I ever to embark on such a venture again, Sweeten is definitely where I would go to first. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Brooklyn family moved into their new Prospect Heights home, the large living space presented an intriguing but daunting challenge. The condo had been meticulously renovated, so design decisions and new ideas for carving out additional storage were a bit fraught. The new owners loved Mid-Century modern design, but weren’t looking to create a home that felt like a lost episode of <em>Mad Men</em>. With dreams of built-ins and sophisticated furniture (that would still work for kids on the move), they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and met <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Susan</a>, a Manhattan designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Adam_Living-Room-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27219 mb-0 size-full" title="mid-century living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Adam_Living-Room-03.jpg" alt="mid-century living room" width="1000" height="660" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Adam_Living-Room-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Adam_Living-Room-03-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Adam_Living-Room-03-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-15652"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building had recently been renovated to show off its beautiful bones and over-sized windows: a blank slate but also a tall order. Susan set out to blend the family’s existing pieces with organic materials and lighter lines along with some cost-effective construction decisions. The expansive living room and open kitchen offered plenty of space to work with, but also required thoughtful planning to create more distinct and functional spots for eating and entertaining. Setting out to create a stylish and functional space, Susan focused on achieving that style along with serious comfort and practicality.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15665 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-01-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15663 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-Before-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan decided to break up the spacious living room with several areas designed for hanging out. “My goal was to make the space as multi-functional as possible so the room would work for the family in as many ways as possible,” she said. After presenting the family with a few layout options, they settled on a floorplan with three zones: a relaxed living space, a dining area destined for lingering over meals, and a reading nook.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of letting proximity to the kitchen dictate the dining room’s location, Susan established the room’s focal point with a central statement-making chandelier from Apparatus Studio. The fixture&#8217;s diffused orbs draw the eye up to the rustic beams and enviable ceiling height. “It has a lot of volume so it helped enhance the room&#8217;s openness,” she said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15660 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15669 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the couple originally envisioned a set of new custom bookshelves on the large wall, which would have been very costly, Susan wanted to preserve the room’s uncrowded feel. “I felt like there was something so beautiful and spacious about the room,” Susan said. As an alternative, storage was moved upstairs, making room for a subtle, monochromatic accent wall. Susan chose a classical lotus pattern that nearly recedes from afar. “It’s such a large area that I wanted a pattern that read as a pattern, but wouldn’t be jarring or too highly contrasted,” she said. The neutral cream-on-beige tones leave open the possibility of future additions such as shelves or artwork down the road.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Susan carved out a dining space with a custom-made banquette. In bright orange, the leather upholstery is incredibly durable and, like a fine wine, will improve with age. “Banquettes are great with kids because they can kind of pile in there and be comfortable,” Susan said. The couple’s existing Cherner chairs were paired with two upholstered counterparts on either end of a sprawling dining table to make good use of the elongated space. The Mid-Century Modern crush continued with overscale swing-arm sconces to bookend the dining space and throw light on the table. A “puzzle” mirror made from individual salvaged wood pieces brings in an organic element to match the ceiling beams and bounce light from the windows and a nearby reading nook provides the perfect place to relax post-dessert. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15668 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-04.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15667 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-04" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the opposite side of the room a Moroccan rug anchors the seating area, while a dual-sided daybed lets guests cozy up for conversation or gaze out the window. A round marble-topped coffee table borrows that ‘60s vibe and breaks up the rectilinear room. The child-friendly cowhide ottomans were inspired by the couple’s first visit to Susan’s design studio; her workspace features the exact same ottomans and the family was smitten. </span>“The ottomans are great because they’re so transportable, and I love that they introduce a unique texture and pattern,” Susan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15666" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-05" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SWEETEN_Prospect-Heights_Living-Room-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">To give the family the storage they desired, built-in shelving from Atlas Industries was installed in the den upstairs as a more affordable and flexible alternative. “It was an easier spot to tackle because the space between the column and window wall formed a kind of natural niche,” Susan said. With tons of reading material at their fingertips (and a TV for less scholarly pursuits), the area is set for maxing and relaxing. The  L-shaped sofa is roomy but still cozy, and the coffee table has a removable leather top to conceal extra storage underneath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, the project took about six months from initial meetings to installation. Susan credits the project’s success to the family’s combination of clear vision and openness to new ideas. Her best advice for getting your own high marks when working with a designer is to come to the table with as many inspiration images as possible and with priorities of how you want to use the space—and spend your money. “There’s such a range out there between readily available pieces, high-end custom, and everything in between,” Susan said. “Make a list of top priorities of how you want the space to function so you can work through your budget.”</span></p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Blane&#8217;s apartment overhaul is truly unforgettable. The post, originally published in 2016, showcases a mix of high-end materials and appliances paired with budget-friendly cabinets. An accountant by trade, Blane knows when to splurge and when to save, blending stock items with custom pieces throughout his home. Read on for a smart reno and play a fun game of &#8220;spot the pup!&#8221; in the photos below.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After “countless hours of watching HGTV,” Blane started to have big thoughts about ways he might make the kitchen and bathroom in his Ditmas Park/North Midwood condo better. While neither space was in particularly bad shape, he knew when he moved in that he would be plagued by a lack of light in the kitchen, and the bathroom felt mismatched to modern updates elsewhere in the apartment. With visions of a TV-worthy renovation, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and was introduced to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane works in accounting at a law firm and is no stranger to budgets, so he was fastidious with his planning, choosing materials and fleshing out a game plan before even meeting with a contractor. With an initial budget of $35K, he planned to brighten the kitchen with cabinets in a lighter hue, substantially increase the limited counter space with an island, add a sliding door to the bedroom to keep the entry transition as efficient as possible, and cultivate a luxurious vibe in the master bath with an oversized walk-in shower and a neutral color scheme in place of its existing minty and slightly medical vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15588 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15590 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After extensive research and some early attempts at drawing out his own cabinet footprint, he got started with his contractor. First, the team decided to tackle the bathroom. Here, Blane got his inspiration from an unlikely place. “My first purchase was actually the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a>, and things kind of evolved around there,” Blane said. “I’ve never had any sort of fancy toilet like that before. The new toilet has a remote, which I had never heard of. The Japanese are at the forefront of luxury so we’ll trust them.” The Toto toilet was just the beginning of the luxe vibe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane chose a combination of slate and hexagon mosaic tiles for the wall, with a neutral mix of stone and wood for the heated (yes, heated!) floors. Then he pulled out all the stops with a walk-in, double-wide shower with a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a> and rain showerhead, plus a double sink vanity, in a bit of long-range planning to make the apartment cohabitation-friendly. The contractor&#8217;s team capped the detailed work with a slanted, but sturdy, bench design in the shower and herringbone tile design on the bathroom floor, all in a soothing gray palette.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34002 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34003 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x471.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="471" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34004 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x1069.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="1069" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Blane chose white upper cabinets with gray base units, giving the space a brightened, more modern effect. After heavy research focused on IKEA, the contractor actually suggested Blane swap his blueprint for a similar cabinet option from Home Depot, which gave him the same lacquered and bright uppers, with a striated gray laminate bottom set. The team removed a wall and moved the oven to the other side of the cabinet line, opening up the kitchen and improving the flow for prep and serving. To give Blane even more space for culinary exploits (and entertaining), the team brought in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> with a durable, waterfall quartz countertop with room for bar seating. Bonus: The island features its own electrical outlets, thanks to the contractor who snuck in a power source under a few floorboards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34008 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x464.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="464" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34017 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Cabinets.gif" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34019 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-1-723x489.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="489" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34012 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dining room, Blane purchased a stunning ghost wood table, handmade by Jim at <a href="https://www.breukelentafel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breukelen Tafel</a> in Carroll Gardens. To highlight the space, he and the team created a wallpapered accent wall to bring together the table, the gray walls, and the white and gray in the kitchen. “I think the wall, even though it was a simple thing, is now one of the best features of the apartment,” Blane said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_Blane_Kitchen_Bathroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blane admits that the process was mostly painless—despite living in the condo with a dog throughout the renovation. Though he went over his budget by 40 percent, he admits it was because of his decisions to choose more premium materials rather than any runaway labor costs. Even with the bathroom and kitchen in process at the same time, Blane was impressed that living in the rubble could be possible thanks to the team’s efforts to seal up the work zones and keep dust to a minimum. Looking at the finished product, Blane is thrilled. “I’m really happy it worked out,” Blane said. “Especially since I didn’t have a designer and I was relying on my accountant abilities to make good decisions.” Even though the contractor didn&#8217;t come from a design and build firm, his decades of experience let Blane lean on him for opinions and advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Blane’s best advice for anyone going into the process is to do as much research as possible and be prepared to adjust as challenges come up. Inconvenient issues can sometimes be opportunities: when a light problem with Blane&#8217;s closet or gaps between wall and ceiling tiles were discovered, the contractor came up with elegant solutions that often improved on the original plan. “They take great pride in their work, and even came back to do a touch-up here and there as things settled in the months after the project ended, at no additional cost,” Blane said. “If the final results don&#8217;t speak already for themselves, I highly recommend them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34018 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dark-brown-floor-brown-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Blane-Sliding-Door.gif" alt="dark brown floor and brown door and a staircase" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Blane has the space to sprawl in his upgraded condo with one of Brooklyn’s most adorable dogs, his new pup, Harvey. However, he sheepishly admits he’s not always using that kitchen for intense, five-star-worthy fare. “I’m cooking now more than I was, but you get in that sandwich kick and it’s hard to change from that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21207 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-1-723x469.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="469" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a design/build contracting team after a long search for a move-in ready pad in Williamsburg. He’d scoured New York’s ultra-competitive market for months and landed a charming but worn floor-through unit in a Graham Avenue co-op. The building was a century old and his unit hadn’t been touched since the ‘70s—but with high ceilings and old bones, Austin saw the many cons as potential pros: here was his chance to grab a well-located, window-filled blank slate and start anew. Austin <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a> and planned to put between $100,000 and $150,000 into the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator who spends his days as a consultant for media and cable groups, a full renovation game plan was admittedly ambitious. Sweeten introduced Austin to a contractor to create a sunny and spacious space that maximized every bit of square footage. One of Austin’s guiding goals was to make an apartment that anyone could enjoy, so he opted for a minimalist approach in a neutral color palette. To create the open and airy feeling that Austin was after, the contractors weighed in with suggestions for modern finishes and monochromatic tones that would unite the space and keep the focus on natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14998" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and his Sweeten contractor team managed an incredible feat: with one single design choice, he brought an entirely new feel to the entire space. Matte-finish wide-plank hardwood flooring, and not all that much else, now sets the tone in this serene bedroom and throughout the living areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14984" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To create the kitchen, the team focused on making the most of a slightly slim layout. They swapped the former kitchen space into the living room and turned what was formally a bedroom into a new slim kitchen. They maximized its narrow footprint with all food prep and storage along one wall and then connected the space to the rest of the unit with French doors and glass panel details. Austin chose a very dark soapstone countertop with light marbling &#8211; a stand-out feature that is low maintenance and impervious to acid, bases, and heat. A custom table from <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a> turns the room into a hangout spot and pulls double-duty as both breakfast nook and workspace.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom showcases a blend of the old world and new, with a mosaic hexagon marble tile floor paired with more contemporary limestone on the walls. Couple that with a sprawling vanity and a stacked washer/dryer, and the project started to feel complete.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin initially worried that the process would be daunting, but thanks to regular check-ins and tech-savvy partners, the crew kept the project on time and on budget, even when surprise issues like termite damage came up. Since he was often traveling for work, his Sweeten contractors instituted regular check-ins and created a DropBox to share images of the progress with Austin, right down to snapshots of the inside of his insulated floors.</p>
