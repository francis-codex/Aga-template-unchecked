<h3>Making your galley kitchen bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The key to making your galley kitchen inspiration successful is all about maximizing the available square footage. But when you&#8217;ve optimized every inch and <em>still</em> need more space, the question becomes: <strong>how do you make a galley kitchen bigger?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Demolishing the entire kitchen and its surrounding walls is not always a realistic option. Bringing down walls partially provides some openness while not eliminating all walls which are important for storage. Another way to expand a galley kitchen layout is by allowing the kitchen to extend into nearby living spaces. See how the five Sweeten renovations below snuck in a little more outside their two walls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A countertop extension perfect for parties</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24796" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of taking down walls to open things up, Joel and Eric worked with their designers to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wraparound kitchen countertop</a> to join the kitchen and nearby dining room. The one-piece counter is perfect for hosting parties: it provides a spot for pouring drinks and serving buffet-style dinners without leaving the kitchen. As a bonus, the extended storage helps mitigate the build-up of clutter.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Simple solution: a pass-through</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="built in oven in a kitchen pass through" width="2000" height="3000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Gina and Andrew’s kitchen was closed off from the rest of their apartment. As a layout, being closed off isn’t always undesired. However, the couple wanted to move beyond their dark galley kitchen, which also had an awkward layout. Their plans required moving a load-bearing wall. Therefore, architectural drawings needed to be submitted for approval. It was worth it for their Sweeten contractor to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-seat breakfast bar</a> (and fit a stackable washer and dryer). The pass-through gave a new dimension to the galley layout. It also created a welcomed social aspect between the kitchen and dining area. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>A patio comes inside</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43703 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg" alt="bay window" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laura and Tim were ready to trade in their “old and grungy” kitchen in their 1929 brick townhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  They </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remodeled their galley kitchen</a> and kept the layout—with one major change. They enclosed an outdoor patio at the back of the kitchen that had a drafty door which was also poorly located. The new plan was to envelop the patio into the cook space and the adjacent dining area. What started as a kitchen remodel turned into a full-blown extension project. A skylight in the new enclosure brought in a stream of natural light.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Galley kitchen inspiration: Turn the corner</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Melissa and Blake's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shifting the location of a nearby closet allowed Melissa and Blake to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enlarge the galley kitchen</a> into the living room. This created space for more cabinets, a wine rack, and counter space. Their Sweeten contractor removed a second closet also outside the kitchen and built a bar counter with seating in its place. By &#8220;turning the corners&#8221; off the galley, the couple gained a lot more kitchen space.</p>
<h3>Separating the dining area from the kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27107 size-chrono" title="Lisa and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
Moving the eating nook outside of the kitchen allowed Lisa and Chris to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend their cabinets</a> along the back wall. The sink and stove remained in the same locations. However, the fridge was relocated allowing the opposite wall to have a long continuous countertop. A part of the wall was partially removed to create a large, eat-in peninsula. The extremely cramped galley kitchen now felt more open and organized.</p>

<h3>Before: Renovate an outdated Brooklyn kitchen</h3>
<p>Longtime renters Marc and Steve dreamed of having a place of their own. Their search for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn eventually led them to an unexpected choice: a co-op or house? The townhouse, they discovered, was a short commute (only two express train stops) from Manhattan. It would provide more space than a one-bedroom apartment and not have the maintenance fees that go with living in a co-op. After purchasing their new home, they lived in it for seven months before turning their attention to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“It was perhaps the most outdated room and we knew it needed a major renovation,” Marc said. The existing cabinets were grimy and had broken doors. Some were so high up that they were almost unusable. The countertops had seen better days. The too-big appliances—combined with a low drop ceiling—made it feel like the walls were closing in on the already small space.</p>

<h3>After: Creating the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; list and choosing the contractor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a list of must-haves that included a full-size dishwasher and additional storage space, Marc and Steve set out to plan a renovation. “Before Sweeten, we weren&#8217;t sure how to find a contractor we could trust,” Marc said. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posting his project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> led him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reading through great reviews and discussing the contractor&#8217;s past work with Sweeten, he felt confident he was making the right choice and accepted his contractor&#8217;s bid.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fans of the classic, black-and-white New York kitchen, the couple aimed to create a bright space with a clean look, layering plenty of white to make the space feel bigger. “The kitchen needed to be truly functional and not just pretty,” Marc said. As for the design, “we landed on something like ‘a traditional white kitchen goes modern.&#8217;” With a contractor on board, they were finally on their way to the modern black and white kitchen renovation of their dreams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48203 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marc-Floor-1.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Planning and ordering kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to demo the entire space meant that measuring would have to wait and the new cabinets—which usually require some lead time—couldn’t be ordered before work began. The couple decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> and Semihandmade doors because they would arrive sooner than a fully customized set (although Marc noted that the cabinet door delivery took longer than planned). He also mentioned taking advantage of running the cabinets from top to bottom on two walls to get as much storage as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With cabinets of varying sizes, they chose flat-panel doors to streamline the look rather than the Shaker-style that was initially under consideration. The couple opted for full-size appliances (they got their dishwasher!) since they cook and bake on a daily basis, while a counter-depth fridge was installed to save some space and make room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry cabinet</a>. For unity between the backsplash and countertop, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble-looking quartz</a> was selected for both surfaces. To let in more light, their contractor also widened the window over the sink to give a clear view of the garden.</p>

<h3>Marc + Steve&#8217;s renovation tips</h3>
<p>Overall, the renovation took closer to three months—“a month or so longer than we hoped,” Marc shared. “But it was worth it!” While waiting on cabinet doors, his contractor tackled smaller projects, adding new baseboards and trim to the main living area, hanging pendants over the dining table, and removing the drop ceiling that continued throughout the rest of the ground floor. Marc tells us that working with his contractor was a great experience. “We are perfectionists, so we&#8217;d come home to see the work done each day and have a bunch of questions. He always answered patiently and quickly, or fixed things as soon as he could.”</p>
<p><strong>The couple&#8217;s advice to future renovators:</strong> “Check return policies on everything. We ordered a range hood online that wasn&#8217;t what we thought it was. They wouldn’t let us return it because you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reject it immediately at delivery</a>.” Another tip: Dust is going to get everywhere, even with a contractor who&#8217;s careful, so be prepared for some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean-up after the work</a> is done.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Marc-Kitchen.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Why they love their new Sweeten kitchen</h3>
<p>The new space feels light and airy—and much bigger than before. “We can both stand in the kitchen at the same time and it&#8217;s not overly crowded,&#8221; Marc said. &#8220;Design-wise, it&#8217;s the kitchen we always wanted and I don&#8217;t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices!).”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Marc and Steve were most excited for the new kitchen floor and the “wow” moment they achieved with patterned black-and-white tile.</p>

<h3>Flexibility within the renovation</h3>
<p>Due to the building’s landmark status and paper-thin walls, condo approvals were a lengthy process. Once they were complete, the renovation itself took two months. Their contractor encouraged them to keep cooking as a focus, meaning no TV in the kitchen and leaving the &#8220;binge-fests for the den.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Finding something modern</h3>
<p>The couple eagerly agreed on a modern look mixing closed cabinets and open shelves while pairing white and gray shaker-style cabinets with custom black walnut slabs. In the L-shaped kitchen, one of the black walnut slabs acts as a desktop in a built-in—a workspace ideal for her husband, who is usually up before dawn checking email.</p>

<h3>What to splurge and save on</h3>
<p>A white subway tile backsplash with dark gray grout and white quartz counters serve as a simple backdrop. The couple also used brass hardware to add a modern touch. They also planned to splurge on quality countertops, which are known for their durability. To afford this, the couple decided to pass on a highly-desired farmhouse sink for a more affordable stainless steel sink. Durability was a priority for the couple. “This kitchen was built to be used,” said the homeowner. With its greatly increased prep space and extended bar seating, we couldn’t agree more!</p>

<h3>Hosting in their renovated kitchen</h3>
<p>After hosting their first dinner party in the space, she received a thank-you from a friend who said, “I could spend all my days in that kitchen.” The hostess’ response: “And that’s exactly our plan.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Six Sweeten homeowners weigh in on staying or leaving during their remodel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main points to consider when planning a renovation is how you&#8217;re going to minimize the disruption of daily life. It can be tricky if you are updating a kitchen or bathroom. Living without some elements will make surviving a renovation tough (running water, electricity, Wi-Fi), so moving out while work is being done is probably your best option. But if the renovation won&#8217;t affect your needs in a major way, then you might be able to stay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s1">Here are </span>six Sweeten homeowners who moved out—or stuck it out—during their renovation.</p>
<h3>Moving out during demolition</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-industrial-stairs-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44895 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg" alt="black industrial stairs leading to a living room with orange couch after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Carly&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-loft-balcony-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new apartment</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carly had been looking—and saving—for years to buy an apartment of her dreams. So when she found this 500-square-foot co-op in Greenwich Village, she snapped it up. It was a studio with a  lofted bedroom and balcony—what more could she ask? It did need work, however. She wanted to literally raise the roof in order to enclose the loft bedroom and redo the kitchen. The entire renovation took five months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interest of surviving her renovation, Carly decided to move out during the messiest part of the process: the demolition and raising the roof.  &#8220;For much of it, though, I was there,&#8221; said Carly. &#8220;I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases.&#8221; But she doesn&#8217;t regret &#8220;slumming it.&#8221; &#8220;The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!&#8221;</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Airbnb-hopping</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33695 mb-10 size-chrono" title="brown-wooden-floor-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg" alt="brown wooden floor for breakfast nook and living room with blue wall separator after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment combination</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining their apartment</a> with the unit next door eliminated the option of living at home when work began. Since the scope of work extended beyond demolishing walls and the two existing kitchens to build a new one,  Zoe and Arvid moved into a short-term sublet. The couple embarked on an Airbnb-hopping adventure when their lease ended before the work was done. They then decided to live on-site for the second half of the project.</p>

<h3>Expecting while renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Lindsay and Roger&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating the kitchen while nine months pregnant made getting around the apartment a challenge for Lindsay. &#8220;You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere,&#8221; she said. To make it work, she moved everything from the kitchen and living room into the nursery. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-best-renovation-advice-from-sweeten-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future renovators</a>, she recommends going away for a weekend during heavy construction.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Surviving their renovation: A couple toughs it out</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-frameless-glass-separator"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44896 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg" alt="white bathroom with frameless glass separator for white bathtub and floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Sharon and Laurence&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/large-scale-tile-financial-district-bathroom-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence lived in their Financial District apartment for more than two decades before renovating their bathroom. They previously had remodeled their kitchen but were wary of redoing their bathroom. The couple only has one in their apartment so they thought it being out of commission would be tough. Sharon and Laurence ultimately decided to stay in the apartment during the renovation. It wasn&#8217;t ideal but they used a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Moving into a rental</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-minimalistic-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44897 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="large minimalistic living room with black framed glass door and two large windows after renovation" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) The light-filled renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For their family of five, these homeowners wanted an open and airy space. That meant renovating their Upper West Side home, adding another bedroom and bath. They also knocked down walls and updated their kitchen. They turned to Sweeten to find a reliable contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to take their three boys (and two dogs) and move into a rental while the work was being done. “When I told our Sweeten contractor that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that. Even though we lived there without a kitchen, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Neighbors offer hospitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20250 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Nikki and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment renovation</span></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nikki and Chris had to get creative to manage the challenges of being in the space mid-construction. &#8220;Through this experience, we showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week,&#8221; Nikki said. But it was all worth it to see the daily progress and watch the couple&#8217;s vision come to life. The routine became so natural that the couple&#8217;s pug started waiting at the door each morning to greet the contractor&#8217;s team when they arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we’re taking a look at the rebirth of a trinity townhouse in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. The house, built in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories—plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views—and had to be rebuilt from the studs up. Nel decided to keep the original floor plans intact—the first-floor dining room and kitchen, second-floor living room plus full bath, and third-floor master bedroom and bath—and bring them back to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her renovation plans in mind</a>, she came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, to restore the house to its former glory and find a new tenant who would love it just as much as she did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp" alt="Trinity house in Philadelphia" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/18505-Nel-House-01-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/908_082-1000px.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><b><br />
Sweeten: </b>What motivated you to purchase this trinity house and what led to the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>In 2014 I was looking to purchase my first home, and when I saw this house I absolutely fell in love with it. The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses—so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27906 mb-10 size-chrono" title="trinity house floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan-723x896.jpg" alt="trinity house floor plan" width="723" height="896" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Example of a trinity floor plan that&#8217;s similar in size and layout to Nel&#8217;s house</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What’s your favorite part of the house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What it was like working with your general contractor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nel: </b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Now let’s check in with the Sweeten general contractor responsible for this townhouse’s transformation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor:</b> It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand. Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten: </b>What was the damage done by the fire?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>We installed all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect—we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior. The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> The results are simply stunning—all of your hard work has definitely paid off!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten contractor: </b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match. We are very proud of the work we did here and how the home turned out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Nel and her Sweeten general contractor for sharing their story, both the good and the bad, and giving us a look inside this reborn trinity!</em></p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43072 mb-0 size-full" title="Console sink and medicine cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="console sink" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43077" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43076" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

			<h3>An overview of how to start planning for your outdoor remodel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50622" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg" alt="Outdoor remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-06-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sprucing up the out-of-doors</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether your outdoor space is seasonal or livable all year-round, having an exterior spot to relax is an upgrade in lifestyle and property value. You may be wondering how to make the most out of a rooftop deck or an urban backyard. Preparing for an outdoor remodel has many moving parts—some projects more complex than others. We break down how to begin planning and share a timeline so your green space can be ready by summertime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Decide on your outdoor space plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Santi, the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a> who transformed <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-expert-santiago/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K.V.’s backyard</a>, shared the following advice with us: “Just like any other project around the house, I recommend taking some time to decide what your goal is” for your outdoor space. Will you be using the space primarily for dining, grilling, gardening, or play? Decide what you want to prioritize: functionality or ornamentation. If there are kids involved, that will be a determining factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning her attention to her brownstone’s backyard, K.V. knew she wanted to use the space to host friends and barbecues. She took inspiration from gardens in Mexico and Brazil, leaning toward a more tropical atmosphere. A tall cedar fence to provide privacy was a must-have.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31799 size-full" title="blue-floor-tiles-terrace-space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg" alt="blue floor tiles in a terrace space with outdoor furniture and blue door after renovation" width="1000" height="649" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-300x195.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04_Sweeten_807-RoofDeck-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate remodeled <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their rooftop deck</a> to double as a &#8220;bonus room&#8221; for hanging out. It was outfitted with comfortable seating and plants to make it feel cozy. However, the rooftop felt open and exposed, so a visual barrier of plantings was placed along the perimeter. The couple also brought in a fire pit for chilly, late-summer nights.</p>
<h3>Be flexible with material choices</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">K.V. had her heart set on bluestone to create a walkway to the elevated patio in her backyard. “She had a budget she didn’t want to go over,&#8221; Santi said. &#8220;She asked us to price out bluestone, but it was a little too high, so we looked for other materials.&#8221; He added, “Homeowners should always price projects with different materials [because] changing the materials doesn’t mean changing the final goal or look of the design.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a surprise twist, they discovered bluestone buried under the dirt in the yard during demolition. K.V.&#8217;s backyard remodel paved the ground with gravel, pavers, and bluestone. While a budget might limit some choices, your contractor may be able to suggest alternative materials that fit the budget and achieve the look you want.</p>
<h3>Choosing plants for color, texture, and to enhance privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We asked Justin, a horticulturist at <a href="https://www.costafarms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costa Farms</a>, to fill us in on how to choose the right plants. “The first and most important thing is to get a realistic sense of your area’s growing conditions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider the sun, moisture, and exposure to wind, and then pick plants that like or at least tolerate what your space has to offer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those sunny spots, Justin recommends heat-loving tropical plants, such as hibiscus, mandevilla, and allamanda. In shady areas, birds of paradise and majesty palm are perfect for adding drama. Croton and colorful aglaonema provide a pop of color. If you choose plants that won’t survive the winter, keep them in a pot so you can bring them indoors when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>Nate and Michelle turned to landscaping to soften their space. Their landscape designer proposed lavender and feather reed grass to frame the seating area and a Japanese Maple tree. Justin also suggests other tall plants, like arborvitae, columnar juniper, and yew for privacy.</p>
<p>In K.V.’s yard, Santi filled in the spotty grass with fresh sod to transform the lawn into a thick green carpet. He also added a row of mulch along one wall for a small but manageable garden. Potted plants fill out the patio and walkway, providing color and texture.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32859 size-full" title="outdoor-plants-images" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg" alt="outdoor plants images" width="1000" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-300x300.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5TipstoCreateanOutdoorSpace-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />

<h3>Choose low-maintenance plants and automated irrigation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors, New Yorkers prefer outdoor spaces that are low maintenance. A landscape plan with a three-season oasis, automated irrigation in the morning, flowering shrubs during the day, and accent lights illuminating trees and fences at night would be ideal. If you find yourself unlucky in plant-love, Justin has some advice: “Coleus is a fun choice that thrives in sun or shade and has delightful, dramatically colored foliage you can enjoy from spring to frost.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Similarly, consider sweet potato vine: It spills down over the side of a planter, creating an elegant look. It also grows as a groundcover or can be trained to grow up a trellis or other structure,&#8221; Justin said. &#8220;Torenia, also called wishbone flower, is another option you can grow in sun or shade.” And if watering is your biggest concern, he advises planting mandevilla, lantana, angelonia, purslane, and evolvulus.</p>
<p class="p1">For the renovation, your landscape design should be set before demolition begins, said NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5301#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Shenna</a>. “The design will determine where plumbing and electrical lines are run, as well as the rough-in for the sprinkler system,” she said. “These are laid down right after demolition.” However, there&#8217;s time with final landscaping choices. They get planted around the last month or so of the project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Plan your outdoor remodel in the off-season</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to remodel a green space, start planning and working in the off-season. For those not ready to plant or are just building up towards a green thumb, use the warm seasons to find inspiration, and plan during winter.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a typical timeline to guide you. Pro tip: Start the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the fall, begin mapping out the design, landscaping, and materials with an architect/designer/contractor. “Planning, designing, and finalizing the fine details of the project can take months,” said Shenna. This gives the contractor enough time to work with the homeowner and/or designer to get all of the pieces in place.</p>
<p class="p1">By December, permits should be submitted, your contractor hired, and materials ordered (keep delivery times in mind).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Demolition should break ground by March/April for an outdoor remodel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The best time to physically start working on an outdoor space is in the spring.” said Shenna. “The weather makes it possible to get everything prepped and ready.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg" alt="Backyard deck area with horizontal wooden fencing and barbeque grill after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50569" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Managing the outdoor remodel infrastructure</h4>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6256#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor</span></a> Mike, who is based in NYC said, “The scope of the project, the square footage of the outdoor space, and material delays” will affect how much time goes into the planning phase in advance. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. However, an outdoor kitchen that requires plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals than a deck remodel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an outdoor space, there’s a lot more to consider, like drainage. Your general contractor should have an in-depth understanding of how bulk water will be managed and how your plans will impact the neighbors. If you’re working on a roof, make sure you have access points for clearing roof drains.</p>
<h4>Organizing material delivery and approvals</h4>
<p class="p1">Your team will also have to haul all of the materials to your outdoor space. Hauling roof deck lumber, soil, sod, and plant matter up through service elevators can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative is booming materials to the roof by crane. Contractors usually have partnerships with local greenhouses and lumber yards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>They can move materials from the street to a garden more efficiently and cost-effectively than using a service elevator.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, make sure you have the necessary approvals. Most exterior improvements will require an alteration agreement and approval from the building&#8217;s architect, and many will require filing with the city. If you live in a landmarked building, special regulations will apply.</p>
<p class="p1">Start and plan early with the right professionals onboard. A well-planned deck or garden can greatly increase the value of a property. It will be time and money well-spent. When you’re ready to get started on your outdoor remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service. Read all about Sweeten&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling and estimate comparison call.</a> (You can also read up on this process with Sweeten&#8217;s guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid leveling</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you meet the contractors during site visits, be prepared with a list of questions to ask. Do not be afraid to speak up about what you want! That being said, be open to a contractor&#8217;s ideas and suggestions. The licensed contractor is a professional with a wealth of knowledge about construction and years of experience. This is their specialty, and they likely have answers to all of your questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Seven serene retreats with tucked-in storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the rest of your home, your bedroom is a place to surround yourself with the things you love. It&#8217;s also a place for more personal trinkets and mementos, which means storage for those (and, of course, all your clothes) is key. By incorporating custom built-ins, floating shelves, and even a hidden closet, these Sweeten homeowners&#8217; private spaces are certain to inspire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22583 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22583 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, serene, storage, neutral" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22585 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22585 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, closet, serene, storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/interior-designer-rearranges-order-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney and Laurence&#8217;s</a> apartment was a huge plus—the awkward closet layout was anything but. Their contractor knocked down the four separate closets and created one dressing room to accommodate both of their wardrobes. Careful planning left ample room for two large dressers, plus a king-size bed. To top it off, their feng shui consultant advised on the furniture plan and placement to summon the harmonious, well-organized bedroom of their dreams.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft18.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowner&#8217;s</a> apartment boasted stunning natural light thanks to its west-facing windows—it just needed some minor storage reconfiguration to bring it up to snuff. To take advantage of the high ceilings, the contractor built open shelving across the length of the room. The original closet was moved between the bedroom and bathroom, and reimagined as a walk-in dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22186" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom with built-in and window seat" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22187" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="close-up of built-in and window seat in bedroom" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/">Claudia</a> set out to redesign her bedroom, a window seat was at the top of her list, along with the need for more storage. In order to meet both demands, a multi-functional built-in was designed around the casement to house books and keepsakes. Staying true to her vision, a custom seat was added and topped with an upholstered cushion to create a cozy spot for curling up with a good book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22191 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with double closets" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-20415"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20415 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2-723x1085.jpg" alt="sweeten_hari_apartment-16" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/">Hari and Kaity&#8217;s</a> apartment had limited closet space and lots of square footage left over for furniture. To address growing storage concerns, the couple decided to use the far wall of the bedroom to build out a pair of full-size closets filled with custom shelving and storage. Now that they have plenty of room to store clothing and more, the original closet was transformed into an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22188" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="Modern bedroom with floating shelves" width="723" height="517" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a redesign of their apartment knocked down most of the walls in favor of an open-plan arrangement, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/">Mario and Joe</a> realized they needed more wall space to display their growing treasures from travels around the globe. Stacked floating shelves in their bedroom became the perfect solution to showcase their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22189" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with built-in for books" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a large assembly of books and a serious lack of storage space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/">Christine</a> turned to the nearly blank canvas of her bedroom for a thoughtful solution. The wall behind her bed was transformed into a library with a custom built-in that reaches from floor to ceiling, while a pewter paint finish softens the predominantly white space. Key elements for a personal library include wall sconces that are essential for reading in bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22190 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="White bedroom with dressing room attached" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22203" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-723x482.jpg" alt="White bedroom with dressing room attached" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By preserving the wall between the bedroom and newly created walk-in dressing room, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/">Jerry and Janet</a> were able to move the closet out of sight while keeping it easily accessible. Positioning the bed in the middle of the room with the dressing area behind the headboard adds an interesting architectural element to the space. The streamlined design also complements the original 1910 window moldings that were painted black for a touch of contrast.</p>

<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>I love that I can transform a space and make it into what the client wants as well as my vision. The gratifying part is the thanks I receive for my work and the fact that I actually made a difference in someone’s life.</p>
<p><strong>If you couldn’t be a general contractor what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I’d be painting.</p>
<p><strong>What are some myths or misconceptions about contractors that you want to set straight?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a misconception that all contractors are cheats and liars. It is a very challenging job, but I do think that contractors who are professional provide an incredible service to the community and I do think that we change lives for the better.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a builder-grade kitchen in Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The birth of the couple&#8217;s first child came two weeks after purchasing a two-story rowhouse in Philadelphia’s Graduate Hospital neighborhood. The baby’s arrival meant that plans to renovate the builder-grade kitchen would have to be put on hold. Fast forward two years later, with another baby on the way, this growing family decided to squeeze in the much-needed renovation before the due date. The kitchen was in dire need of a change: remodeled in 2004, it had generic faux wood cabinets, inefficient appliances, limited storage, and a lack of natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34743 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-Before-01-723x722.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia" width="723" height="722" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As a couple who loves to cook and dine in their eat-in kitchen, the homeowners wanted to make it brighter and more efficient. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten were matched with a general contractor. “[The kitchen] gets a LOT of use as the main backdrop for our lives,” the homeowner explained. The biggest change on the list of must-haves was the relocation of the exterior door to another wall in order to make room for a seating nook. To boost the flow of sunlight, a new window was planned for the spot where the old door originally stood. Inspired by the homeowner’s experience working in museums, the new kitchen, with flat-front all-white cabinets, unobtrusive hardware, and few distractions on the countertops, would feel similar to the clean backdrop of an empty gallery space; bright and full of potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34752 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-08-723x1012.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertops, white cabinets, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="1012" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The white quartz <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a> and backsplash create a clean backdrop while the emerald green <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile </a>adds plenty of character. Most of the improvements in the kitchen—a trash can tucked behind a cabinet door and drawers beneath the sink—felt like the missing pieces of the puzzle. New <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliances</a>, including a smaller refrigerator taking up less space and a range hood that vents outside instead of recirculating air inside, are all energy-efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34746 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, white cabinets, seating nook" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34747 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, seating nook, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The first-time renovators discovered you may not know what you&#8217;ll find behind the walls in your home. In the process of moving the entrance, their Sweeten contractor opened up the walls and uncovered missing overhead support beams, structurally unsound vertical supports, mysterious gaps of empty space, and interior-grade drywall behind the exterior siding instead of plywood. He patiently and quickly worked to solve the serious problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34755 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-11-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, range hood, white quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34749 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Liz-W-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Philadelphia, kitchen, emerald green floor tile, white quartz countertop, range hood, white cabinets" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the issues behind the walls extended the timeline from 2-3 months to 6 months. The baby was born in the middle of it all, but now that work is done, the family has peace of mind knowing their home is structurally sound. “We love our new kitchen,” the homeowner tells us, “We realize that while it might be too monochrome for some, it&#8217;s exactly what we wanted.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Slide right into a more flexible living space with these renovations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walls and doors are losing popularity in the era of open-plan living, but what if you could have the best of both worlds? Imagine a space that is open to the rest of your home—or closed off—depending on your mood. Enter the sliding door: a feature that takes up minimal floor space and blends into its surroundings when not in use, becoming an architectural detail in the home. Whether you prefer the rustic feel of a barn or the simple elegance of French doors, these Sweeten homeowners will inspire you to create a home with disappearing borders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33691 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-white-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-31.gif" alt="white barn door in a white living room with wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic barn door separates the living room from the bedroom in Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment combination</a>. Painting the door white to match the nearby walls allows it to blend into the background, while black hardware adds contrast with a modern twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-34-35.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25786 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-36-38.gif" alt="sliding doors, office doors, natural light " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While not in use as an entryway, a pair of sliding doors gives Larry the option to watch a game on the TV in the adjoining lounge from inside his <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-renovation-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office</a>. The doors also increase the flow of natural light into the windowless room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25014 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-15-16.gif" alt="sliding doors, open floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sliding doors in Ana and Leo&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-plan apartment</a> connect the dining area to the office when open, and transform the office into a guest bedroom when closed. In lieu of a traditional door, the oversized panels allow them to combine both rooms into one big space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22102 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="sliding doors, open space, privacy " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing a barn door with three store-bought doors together in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining area</a> (and painting it in the same color as the surrounding walls—Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore) makes it possible for Lauren and Ross to hide the study when they want to create a more intimate space.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="sliding doors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="sliding doors, french doors, pocket doors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-nyc-homecoming-prompts-a-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexible living space</a>, Margery and Jim planned to separate the guest bedroom from the kitchen with a pair of sliding doors. Instead of going for a simple set of barn-style doors, the couple&#8217;s general contractor fused together two salvaged French doors the couple found at an estate sale and built them into a pocket door. When opened, the entire wall disappears. Magic!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If there&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve learned in seeing thousands of renovations, it&#8217;s not the size of the remodel that matters; it&#8217;s how closely you pay attention to the details. Thoughtful and careful consideration of the materials and finishes used in a space can have a huge impact. Read on for three Sweeten homeowners who took their small spaces to the next level.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Project</strong></strong></span>: Revive a tired bathroom</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Location</strong></strong></span>: Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Before</strong></strong></span>: </span>When the sink cracked in this homeowner’s outdated bathroom, it got her thinking about the rest of the space. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Planning on keeping the plumbing intact, her to-do list included swapping out the tile, wallpaper, vanity, and lighting fixtures, in addition to reglazing the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-white-bathroom-with-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48980 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige and white bathroom with vanity and sink and green wallpaper before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><strong>After</strong></strong>:</span>White subway tile paired with a marble hex floor tile increased the brightness tenfold. A brand new sink (free of cracks) and simple white vanity replace the old set while <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-century modern sconces</a> flank the mirror. This clean and crisp makeover makes it hard for us to believe that we&#8217;re looking at the same bathroom from the &#8220;before&#8221; photos!</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A rip-and-replace opens up a kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Murray Hill, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: </span>This homeowner&#8217;s newly purchased apartment was in great condition but the kitchen needed some work, so he posted his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Aiming to create an open kitchen with clean lines, the focus was placed on knocking down walls, redoing cabinets and countertops, installing new appliances, and replacing the flooring.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-kitchen-island-bar-stools" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48986 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown kitchen island and bar stools along with brown kitchen cabinets before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>Glossy white upper cabinets are balanced by espresso wood-grain cabinets along the bottom, providing a sharp (and welcome!) contrast to the bland wood tone cabinets from before. Under-cabinet lighting boosts the overall brightness, reflecting off the bright white backsplash and countertops. The muted walls—painted in an almost buttercream shade—and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blonde hardwood floors</a> add just the right amount of warmth.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade an outdated bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Washington Heights, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: This postwar apartment had good bones but was borderline decrepit when the homeowner purchased it. Ready to gut-renovate, she <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and found <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten architect</a>. One of the rooms that needed a complete overhaul was the bathroom. Her plan: combine clean lines and useful storage with touches of vintage modern style (which may sound like an oxymoron but happens to be a real thing—it’s a combo of old-school style meets modern simplicity).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>New fixtures and a <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-wide medicine cabinet</a> bring a much-needed functional upgrade. The slim profile of a pedestal sink takes up little floor space, allowing the opposite wall to take on extra storage in the form of open shelves and a spot for a hamper. A glass shower partition—as opposed to a shower curtain—improves the flow of light and helps make </span>the space<span style="color: #000000;"> feel bigger. White square tiles lend a twist to the classic subway variety.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Nobody wants a bedroom design that&#8217;s a snooze</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is your bedroom a peaceful retreat, or does the vibe remind you of a college dorm room—or worse? Whether you’re dealing with lack of storage, an unsightly radiator, or discolored and uneven walls, don’t stress! From clever disguises (what radiator?) to secret storage, these remodeling tips from Sweeten homeowners help you get closer to the bedroom of your dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom radiator cover</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32112 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt22.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
Terri and Brett&#8217;s master bedroom in their Prospect Heights <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a radiator in your space, your design goal will be to disguise the unit and let it fade into the background. Homeowners (and architects) Terri and Brett did just that, designing a custom radiator cover that would blend in with their minimalist decor. Their millworker brought their plans to life and installed clips along the slatted fronts, making them removable for easy access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Built-in shelving</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31429 size-chrono" title="guest bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-25-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
The guest bedroom in AJ and Ray&#8217;s Sunset Park <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a bed takes up most of the floor space, it might be hard to find room for additional furniture like a dresser or bookcase. AJ and Ray found a way to add storage to their guest bedroom in the form of built-in shelving, taking advantage of a nook between the closet and entrance that was too narrow for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Window seat with storage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
Matthew&#8217;s bedroom in his Hell&#8217;s Kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another option for dealing with a lack of dresser space in the bedroom: install a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in cabinet</a> that&#8217;s raised a couple inches off the ground.

<p style="text-align: justify;">While fresh paint is capable of reviving just about any space, it won&#8217;t do much in the way of hiding scratches and dents.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bypassing the butterflies to achieve their dream space<br />
<b></b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating your home—from changing the layout of the kitchen to installing new flooring—is a process that relies heavily on balancing the big-picture vision with its finer details. Neophyte renovators may feel at a disadvantage to their more experienced peers, but with Sweeten on their team, they’ve got the best of both worlds: a fresh perspective paired with the support of a company dedicated to making sure the renovation goes right. Below, six renovators recount how they dealt with challenges during their first major renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32402 mb-0 size-chrono" title="happy-couple-renovated-home" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-723x482.jpg" alt="happy couple in their renovated home" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Purchasing an apartment in Manhattan inspired Heather to begin dreaming about renovating while her boyfriend, Eric, secretly planned a proposal to coincide with the acceptance of their offer. Rather than putting any of their plans on hold, the newbie renovators—and newly engaged couple—<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to go through with the remodel</a> before the wedding. Focusing on the kitchen and new flooring throughout, they prepared for a tight timeline. When the seller delayed the closing, Heather and Eric rolled up their sleeves to keep things on track. “With this delay, we, along with our contractor, had to personally roll our new kitchen cabinets across two New York City avenues!” Eric said. “Truthfully, we look back and are still unsure how we were able to sketch, design, renovate, and implement all of our changes without any background or experience in any of these areas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31709 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Olivia and Greg's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Olivia and Greg <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-co-op-reno-designed-to-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off the reno</a> of their Upper West Side co-op while expecting their first child. With a list of must-haves that included the kitchen, two bathrooms, and closet build-out in the master bedroom, the couple learned to be patient and check on progress as often as possible to avoid problems later down the line. One smart tip they shared with us: identify a set of priorities and keep your eye on the prize. “Renovating can be addicting!” Olivia said, “Once you start, you’ll begin to realize all the imperfections in your home, which could add on tens of thousands of dollars to your project. But don’t get distracted. Stick with the original plan; you can always renovate again at another point.” The couple’s fierce determination helped them complete their remodel just in time for the birth of their son, Max.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32888 size-chrono" title="Bellamy and Zak's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-18-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year after buying a 2,400-square-foot brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Bellamy and Zak found themselves <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning their first major renovation</a>. They relocated the rental unit from the top floor to the garden level and got to work on updates throughout the first and second floors. While staying on budget was critical in order to get everything done, there were a few things that Bellamy didn’t mind paying extra for. “Now that the house is done, I am so thankful we splurged on what we wanted—replacing the windows, skim-coating, and repointing the brick; those are some of my favorite things in the house,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31301 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-dining-space-natural-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg" alt="gray dining space in a natural wood flooring and a dining table with man working after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten years after winning the housing lottery for an apartment near Manhattan’s South Street Seaport, Kate and Saul returned to the apartment with the intention of making it their home. With an eye on future resale value, they painted walls, replaced flooring, and remodeled the kitchen and bathroom. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-affordable-housing-co-op-hits-a-reno-lottery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looking back on the reno</a>, Kate let us know that she didn’t feel prepared for all the work that their contractor&#8217;s team needed to do on a daily basis. Another thing she learned: you need to be ready to explain what you want in each space so that the contractor can execute it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay and Roger replaced the cabinets, countertops, and appliances in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their co-op’s outdated kitchen</a> in Ditmas Park. In hindsight, Lindsay said she wishes she spent more time deciding on appliances and included items like the cabinet hardware, faucet, and sink in her budget from the get-go. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval,” she said. Plus, there might an unexpected wait to get plans approved. Lindsay said: “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33423 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Melissa's apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Longtime renter Melissa became a homeowner after buying a 500-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper West Side. Once her offer was accepted, her boyfriend proposed (we’re seeing a trend here!) which meant that the home would need some serious storage to accommodate the two of them. The solution? <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving/">Adding built-ins to every inch</a> of available space. To keep the custom storage from feeling bulky and making the apartment feel smaller, Melissa said: “All the materials were chosen with the idea of making the space feel larger, which seems to be driven by a more modern look.” A simple color palette and clean lines allowed her to incorporate some more traditional elements as well, like pendant lights, the kitchen backlash—reminiscent of old-fashioned tin ceilings—and faux-stone tile in the bath.</p>

<h3>These homeowners needed their own space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When my husband and I got married, my father generously offered us one of their spare bedrooms for nothing more than covering our share of the utilities and cleaning the entire property. My parents kept to themselves mostly, but even so, after six years of cleaning up after them and sharing common spaces, we had had enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had a sizeable down payment due to some fortunate events, enough for a house, but with my husband starting his own business, we decided to buy an affordable co-op and hoped for one that was move-in ready. To our dismay, we quickly found out that co-ops in Northeast Queens were either outdated or renovated in a way that we found ugly and gaudy (think McMansion but inside a co-op). Eventually, we bought a two-bedroom for a reasonable price that hadn’t been updated since it was built in the &#8217;50s, which meant we would have to nearly gut the entire place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asking for recommendations from friends and family for contractors only led to horror stories about shoddy work, condescending attitudes, cheap materials, a lack of knowledge, and poor communication. We contacted eight contractors total and three of them were from Sweeten. Because Sweeten has an entire system for communicating with contractors, the process was so much smoother. Each one visited the site and gave us an itemized quote within the week and promptly answered our questions. It was actually difficult to choose, but in the end, we went with the contractor that we felt the most comfortable talking to since all the quotes were similar.</p>

<h3>Finding a contractor is hardwork</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the other five contractors, those experiences became their own horror stories from just meeting with them and getting quotes. The worst was one contractor who gave us a two-hour window for when he would show up, arrived in the last five minutes, talked on the phone the entire time, did not follow up with a quote, would not give an itemized quote when I followed up, and called a week later saying he vaguely remembered talking to me and was wondering if I still needed a quote. Well, I didn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovations started almost immediately once we picked our contractor. Together, my husband and I selected and bought all the finishing materials. Garden-style co-ops tend to be small, so we picked light colors to make the rooms feel spacious and bright. The color theme continued in the form of off-white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, light-colored tiles in the bathroom, and soft gray walls with white ceilings for most of the rooms. We also really like highly contrasting design, so the accents we chose were typically dark, such as the bathroom hardware, doorknobs, and most of the flooring. Gold accents were only used in the kitchen because I love the look of white kitchens with touches of gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33670 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-07-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33672 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-09-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>This Queens co-op remodel allows for a more spacious kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided early on to have kitchen cabinets that extended to the ceiling for the extra storage because we both love to cook and the existing built-in storage was limited. I also added another wall of cabinets, which includes a full-sized pantry. We will eventually install a vented range hood above the stove, and I wanted to keep the countertops as clutter-free as possible, so I hid the microwave in the pantry. We also opted for a single drawer dishwasher because we found a full-sized unit to be excessive for just two people. The dishwasher serves as our drying rack while the extra drawer under the dishwasher is extra storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33667 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33669 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, hardwood floors, kitchen, gold accents" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A bathroom that is easy to clean</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the bathroom, we went with the typical tub and shower curtain instead of a sliding glass door because it feels more open, and for us, it is easier to clean. We chose the floating sink cabinet for similar reasons. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tiles</a> are in a herringbone pattern to give it a more interesting look. Since the space is small, it was not that much more expensive to do and is one of the most eye-catching parts of the bathroom. The same floor tile was used in the shower nook where we keep our soaps so the tub ledge is clutter-free. The mirrored medicine cabinet also hides a lot of our toiletries and is deceptively large; we had most of it buried into the wall so it would not stick out too far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33682 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33673 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, bathroom, floating sink cabinet, marble tile, herringbone tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33674 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-11-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, bathroom, herringbone tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33675 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-12-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, marble tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33676 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-13-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, queens co-op, bathroom, herringbone tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One snag was the full-sized drawers under the sink. The plumbing needed to be adjusted to have the drawers fit, but even still, they would not fully close. The contractor cut part of the back of the drawer walls to accommodate the plumbing after I made a very sad face at the idea that they would have to cut the entire drawer down. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing but it’s not very noticeable and I am very happy I still have full-sized drawers.</p>
<h3>Drama during their Queens co-op remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, the renovations were the easy part. We had much more difficulty with our own co-op management, which our contractor helped us navigate. We had to replace the kitchen plumbing because it was too old and leaking behind the wall. This required changing the plumbing on the adjacent units, too, so the co-op office had to coordinate the change between all the owners. As is typical in co-op living, drama ensued and no one cooperated which meant our project was stuck and it was up to us to get all the owners to agree. Our contractor went with us to each unit to explain what would happen even though they were not the ones replacing the plumbing. Magically, we easily got everyone’s agreement once they were told the entire situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An even more drama-filled incident was when the co-op started to change all the front doors and windows. We were warned that any damage during the change would be our problem so we asked if we would be able to get them changed during our renovation so that our contractor could immediately fix the damage. The office denied our request and we were ready to resign to our fate, but while complaining to our sympathetic contractor about the situation, he encouraged us to attend the annual meeting to make our case directly to the board. We are very glad we attended because 1) it was very entertaining with all the angry shouting, impassioned pleas, and one instance of a chair being thrown by a board member, and 2) the board granted our request. So we had the door and windows changed and unsurprisingly, it was done poorly and there was damage, which our contractor fixed. As for the drama, that continued for weeks and culminated with citizen notices threatening lawsuits and contacting New York City councilmen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall we had a wonderful experience making this apartment a home for us and our cat! Minus the drama.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how well you prepare, renovating your home can still seem like a daunting task. The unexpected tends to happen when you least expect it, so take advantage of the hard-won knowledge gleaned by our Sweeten homeowners. We asked them to share their advice for future renovators, listed below. Whether you are planning your first project or are an experienced renovator, these home remodeling tips will help guide you on the path to a successful renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 size-chrono" title="apartment renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01-723x482.gif" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Find pictures of rooms with your planned paint color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracking down real-life examples of paint colors used within rooms <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-condo-divides-and-conquers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabled Sophie to nail down</a> the palette for her renovation. Seeing paint samples in person and within 3-D renderings was helpful, but there&#8217;s more to it. &#8220;You’re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. As a solution, Sophie found photos of rooms online that were painted in the same shades she had selected. &#8220;We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I’d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32378 size-chrono" title="gray-panelled-glass-door-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif" alt="gray panelled glass door over white counter and white bar stools after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-200x300.gif 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-600x900.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Don&#8217;t forget the small details while planning ahead</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning ahead is crucial, and it&#8217;s something that many homeowners post-renovation will emphatically recommend to future renovators. &#8220;It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation,&#8221; Heather and Eric said, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following their apartment remodel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32171 size-chrono" title="white-pillar-dining-table" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg" alt="white pillar near dining table with chandelier in ceiling and brick wall after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: See your finishes— counters, molding, and more—in person</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redoing her living room</a> and bringing the dining area into the kitchen, Rachel said she now understands how important it is to see finishes in person before making any decisions. &#8220;It’s really difficult to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like (in real-life) on a computer screen.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31376 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Estimate how fixtures will fit into rooms—and how you&#8217;ll use them</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you&#8217;re thinking about the big picture, don&#8217;t let the smaller details slip through the cracks. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/desperately-seeking-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sari renovated her bathroom</a>, she shared a few tips for a successful remodel: &#8220;Make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. Also, check which side of the toilet you want your flusher on, because you can’t change that.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Use your belongings to make more accurate measurements</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining her apartment</a> with the one next door, Zoe noted that ironing out the details, like knowing how big the closets and drawers should be, will keep your project moving along smoothly. “Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” She also measured the maximum size of her pots so she could find drawers that were the right height.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With spaces that flow and connect, reimagine the way they can be lived in</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An open floor plan provides plenty of space to get creative. Instead of each room having a distinct purpose or design, the layout offers a multifunctional space with unified decor. Combining the living and dining rooms has many benefits; for one, hosting parties is much easier when guests aren’t confined to a single dining room. The larger space lends itself to a more social atmosphere that brings the whole family together and feels cozy rather than cramped. Ready to embrace open-plan living? Take inspiration from the Sweeten renovations below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam</a> took down walls on the main floor of their brownstone to connect the living and dining rooms. Rugs define the borders for each space in a way that doesn’t feel as isolated as dividing walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-31170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> shifted her living room furniture closer to the windows and carved out a spot for a table and chairs, a setup that wouldn’t have fit in the original layout. The long-awaited dining area makes it possible for her to finally have friends over for dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29277" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, it became clear that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan</a> needed to add walls to their open-plan loft to create two separate bedrooms. The dining area was moved closer to the living room furniture and replaced with a long table with bench seating that mirrors the length of the couch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of a formal dining room led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather and Eric</a> to embrace the combined living and dining area in their newly purchased apartment. Choosing all-white furniture for the couch, table, and chairs makes the arrangement feel more intentional and coordinated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28216" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After converting part of the living room into a second bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah and Craig</a> moved their living room furniture next to the dining table. The new and improved layout creates a central hub for gatherings that isn&#8217;t far from the built-in bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

Here, she is able to store extra towels and other toiletries.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="Recessed cabinet in bathroom for extra storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Ross</a>, their bathroom was in need of a major overhaul. They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40140 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg" alt="freestanding blue bathroom cabinet for storage" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A freestanding storage cabinet has the look of a built-in in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine and Chris</a> renovated bathroom. The blue-stained ash wood matches the sink vanity.</p>
