<p>Any home remodel in New York City that involves adjusting partitions or plumbing requires a work permit from the Department of Buildings (DOB).  Although the rules aren&#8217;t always observed, upstanding architects and contractors spend a great deal of time chasing these permits.</p>
<p>I worked with a couple who are remodeling their bathrooms and I&#8217;m shocked at how convoluted the DOB procedure is, even with a professional expediter to help us.  The application required specially formatted construction drawings and two sets of paperwork.  In addition to the architect&#8217;s fee and the expediter&#8217;s fee the owners paid a fee for the DOB filing and another for the work permit.  The most exasperating part was the time frame.  After rushing to submit an application we waited four weeks to hear back from the DOB, who had minor objections, and then another two weeks to hear back after submitting revisions.</p>
<p>The whole effort to get the permit, which took almost two months, felt less like a procedure to protect life and safety than a Medieval ritual to collect wealth for the king.  For small residential remodels like this one, there&#8217;s got to be a simpler, faster way for the city to regulate the work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a>&#8216;s new kitchen design exhibit &#8220;<a title="&quot;Counter Space&quot;" href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/legacy_redirect/exhibitions/1062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counter Space</a>&#8221; puts dozens of everyday kitchen accessories and furnishings on display.  Some are entirely familiar (a soy sauce bottle, Tupperware tumblers, a brown paper bag), and seeing them sitting inside vitrines makes one appreciate how lovely they are.  Other, more unusual objects (a cork-covered serving bowl, a glass-handled frying pan, a jet-pack vacuum cleaner) make one realize how Darwinian product design is, and how only the most cost-effective and useful things survive.</p>
<p>The highlight of the exhibit, installed at the center of the gallery, is a Frankfurt Kitchen from 1926-27, one of the thousands of units mass-produced and installed in public housing projects in Germany after World War I.  It&#8217;s layout is designed to minimize the distances moved between the sink, stove, countertop and table when preparing meals.  It&#8217;s a sweet little room with built-in cutting and ironing boards, and compartments for grains, spices, cooked foods, and garbage.</p>
<p>But the real power of the exhibit is the way it stirs up memories.  One can walk through and identify items from her grandmother&#8217;s kitchen, her childhood home, and her first apartment.  And one can recall with regret all the lovely dishes and appliances of her own that she&#8217;s broken, lost, given away, or sold.  Although our kitchen things are designed for efficiency and ease, we love them dearly.</p>

<p>Another sterile white-walled gallery filled with sterile contemporary art, right?</p>
<p>These paintings and sculptures are actually construction debris, pieces of furniture, carpet, wood flooring and stone tile removed from demolition sites.  The exhibit, called <a title="Usus/Usures" href="https://rotordb.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Usus/Usures&#8221;</a>, is Belgium&#8217;s entry at the Architecture Exhibit at this year&#8217;s <a title="Venice Biennale" href="https://www.labiennale.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venice Biennale</a><span style="color: #000000;">, a kind of architecture Olympics that brings together prominent international design offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/4977812832_60cdd9fe1e.jpg" alt="USUS USURES ROTOR 04" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/4977203479_fc8e7438fe.jpg" alt="USUS USURES ROTOR 03" /><br />
</span></p>
<p>The pieces were curated, or should I say salvaged, by <a title="Rotor" href="https://rotordb.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotor</a>, a Belgian design collective that often work with reclaimed construction materials.  The spaces do look beautiful.  On one level it might be a joke, since some of this garbage has the prettiness of minimalist art.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/4977813212_bc7a0a77b0.jpg" alt="USUS USURESROTOR 05" /></p>

<p>On another level it&#8217;s a statement about how we use things and discard them when they&#8217;ve become old and worn.  The flaws in these pieces give them character.  A scrap of oddly cut carpet,  wood school desks covered with scratchiti, and a stained wood floorboard are all strangely compelling when hung on a gallery wall.  The challenge is to appreciate this kind of artwork when it&#8217;s installed in our homes.</p>

<p>One of the delights of internet searches is that they often lead you to things you didn&#8217;t even know you cared about.  While researching gas ranges the other day I stumbled across this image of a &#8220;compact kitchen,&#8221; a single, 30&#8243;-wide appliance that contains a range, refrigerator and sink. As an architect I pine for everything to be extraordinarily beautiful and elegant, but there&#8217;s something about the stubborn practicality of these pieces that&#8217;s incredibly appealing. Compact kitchens like this one by <a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avanti</a> have won me over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4798380536_2860ae553e.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN AVANTI BLACK" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4797750299_61335e474f.jpg alt=" fridge="" compact="compact" kitchen="" avanti="" white="" open="" /></a></p>
<p>These appliances are commonly installed in offices, RV&#8217;s, dorm and hotel rooms, and basements. But they&#8217;d work beautifully in New York City apartment too, when there&#8217;s not quite enough space for a conventional kitchen. You could just tuck one of these units into the corner of the dining room, at the end of the hall, or in a coat closet.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been around for quite a while. General Air Conditioning made a compact kitchen in the 1950&#8217;s that was featured in <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apartment Therapy</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chicago/good-questions/good-questions-modern-allinone-kitchen-060421" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4798381490_d4c07769b2.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN VINTAGE GE" /></a></p>
<p>In 1964 <a href="https://www.boffi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boffi</a> manufactured a &#8220;Mini Kitchen&#8221; designed by Joe Colombo, and they&#8217;ve since developed an updated model. The original model doesn&#8217;t look like an appliance at all. Encased in stained wood panels, with concealed burners and secret pull-out drawers, it has the geometric purity of cubist sculpture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4797750619_3381ef93d3.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN BOFFI 1964" /></p>
<p>The most basic units are modest in appearance and don&#8217;t cost any more than an ordinary gas range would. But there are also larger, more expensive units that are actually quite handsome. Compact Concepts makes a full-height round, rotating unit that comes equipped with a dishwasher and storage cabinets, and that&#8217;s available in different high-fashion finishes. It would look lovely in a raw, open, loft-like space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4797749877_241e7f6711.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN CLEVERKITCHEN" /></p>
<p>A few years ago architect Zaha Hadid designed two kitchen units, &#8220;Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Water,&#8221; in collaboration with <a href="https://www.dupont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a> and <a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernestomeda</a>. They look more like a spaceship command center than a kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4798381136_32cd53df84.jpg alt=" table="" compact="compact" kitchen="" z="" island="" /></a></p>
<p>Dutch designer Sietze Kalwijk had the opposite approach, stripping typical kitchen fixtures and appliances of all their displays, controls, and shells. This compact kitchen provides only the bare essentials: a burner, a sink, a work surface, and hose connections for gas and water.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kalkwijk.com/ximage/pid/144/i/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4798380674_9da747e894.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN KYDEX" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe one reason these compact kitchens are so appealing is that they make cooking seem simpler and more fun. While a skilled cook could prepare a gorgeous meal with one, for the rest of us they&#8217;re just wonderful playthings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m so attached to the pedestal sink in my bathroom that I was a bit surprised when a client I&#8217;m working with requested a wood vanity cabinet for his bathroom. Why would someone want a vanity?</p>
<p>The most obvious reason is that vanities provide storage that we all need, especially in small New York City apartments. And even the simplest wood vanity adds warmth to a bathroom finished with tile floors and walls and ceramic fixtures. It makes the space feel less utilitarian and more like a real furnished room. Now, after doing a bit of research, I&#8217;m entirely convinced.</p>
<p>Designers sometimes repurpose old night tables and chest of drawers to serve as vanities. Conversely, a lot of vanities are designed to look like antique furniture. I like this kind of &#8220;themed&#8221; vanity in Powder Rooms or Guest Bathrooms, which aren&#8217;t used every day. Can you imagine using <a href="https://www.bathgems.com/" target="_blank">this vanity</a> everyday? I think it was once used by Napoleon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY TRADE WINDS EMPIRE" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4768146788_a83322bd45.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank">vanity</a> was made from an old Chinese trunk. It&#8217;s a dramatic, fantastic look that would look great in a discotheque.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY COLE AND CO CHINESE CHEST" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4767507037_9a3820def2.jpg" /></p>
<p>One trend now is to use &#8220;vessel sinks,&#8221; bowl-shaped sinks that rest on top of a vanity like a washbasin. I like these but water often splashes over the edge of the bowl and it constantly needs to be wiped down. But vessel sinks have a very pretty look, like this <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/onlinecatalog/detail.jsp?prod_num=2200" target="_blank">low, round sink</a> that&#8217;s set on a wood stand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY KOHLER BELL" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4767507175_607f6b5059.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of handsome, simple vanities. There&#8217;s the basic style with two wood doors below, the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd_192257-444-NR24-JVO_0_?productId=1226361&amp;Ntt=vanity%2024&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;Ns=p_product_price%7C0&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?Ntk=i_products$rpp=30$No=480$Ntt=vanity%2024$Ns=p_product_price%7C0$identifier=" target="_blank">platonic ideal</a> of vanity.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, there are a lot of Shaker-style vanities. <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/sagehill-designs-al2421-24-bathroom-vanity-cabinet-with-open-display-shelf-from-the-allure-collection/p1121879?source=gba%7C1121879&amp;CAWELAID=437563236" target="_blank">This one</a> has an open rack below for towels.</p>

<p>This terribly elegant vanity was inspired by Federalist style furniture. But it&#8217;s clean, fine, ladylike lines alos have a luxurious 30&#8217;s modern kind of style. I can imagine a very spirited and beautiful young woman a la Katherine Hepburn preening in front of this piece. I guess that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called vanities.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just started working on an apartment remodel in Kips Bay Towers, a complex on East 30th Street built in 1960 by I. M. Pei.  These are two immense, slab-like towers with concrete frames and distinctive rounded window openings that set them apart from typical white brick modern buildings in Manhattan.  They&#8217;re designed in a style called &#8220;Brutalism&#8221; that was popular at the time but that quickly fell out of fashion.  Brutalism doesn&#8217;t sound like much fun, and certainly not like a nice place to live, but the style is being <a title="&quot;Beautiful Brutes&quot;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/04/23/opinion/20100424_opart.html" target="_blank">appreciated</a> once again for its sculptural and geometric boldness.</p>
<p>Though they&#8217;re fifty years old the towers still have a strong, modern image.  Every time I visit the complex, which has wide walkways and colonnades at ground level, I feel terribly modern.  You need to walk down several feet to reach the main building entry and from here the slab towers above you, crowding out the rest of the city view.  The immense, repetitive facades don&#8217;t feel oppressive but inspiring.  You wish that, like in Paris, Milan or Rotterdam, more parts of our city were built in a progressive, modern way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4735678362_2d63d917e8.jpg" alt="KIPS BAY FACADE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4734914031_02d32211d7.jpg" alt="KIPS BAY ENTRY" /></p>
<p>When you walk into the lobby, which takes up the entire ground floor, you get a sense of how huge the buildings really are.  There are some stone benches and area rugs near the elevator banks, but other than that there&#8217;s no furniture at all, just an endless expanse of tile. These lobbies could use a bit of sweetening.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4735552458_219d37b310.jpg" alt="KIPS BAY LOBBY" /></p>
<p>The courtyard is unexpectedly lush, with a flat lawn, low trees, and hydrangea bushes. The Towers at the sides shape a quiet retreat from city streets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4734914427_ae3193a28d.jpg" alt="KIPS BAY COURTYARD" /></p>
<p>The apartment that I&#8217;m working on is a north-facing one-bedroom on the nineteenth floor.  It feels much larger and warmer than you&#8217;d expect from the outside.  The full-height windows in the Living Room and Bedroom showcase amazing views down into the city and let in tons of light. The owner told us that the only drawback to the apartment design is that  the large single-glazed windows let in drafts in the winter.</p>
<p>A wit once observed that the best thing about the view from the Eiffel Tower was that  the Eiffel Tower wasn&#8217;t in it.  You could make the same claim about Kips Bay Towers.  If you&#8217;re put off by the endlessly repeteitive facades, the rough concrete frames, and the sheer size of them, once you step inside one of the large, comfortable apartments you&#8217;ll find that all of that is easily forgotten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An apartment I&#8217;m remodeling has large mirror panels on one of the living room walls.  The mirrors cover the entire surface of the 12-foot-wide wall and are trimmed with a narrow aluminum angle.</p>
<p>These mirrors do a fantastic job of bouncing light around \ and enlarging the sense of space, but they have an early 70&#8217;s feeling that might not feel right with the reduced, modern feeling of the finished apartment, which will have dark oak floors and white walls.  I&#8217;d like to replace these panels with one or more large framed mirrors.</p>
<p>We could use mirrors with a minimal frame, like these <a title="West Elm Floor Mirrors" href="https://www.westelm.com/products/w538/?pkey=cmirrors" target="_blank">floor mirrors</a> from West Elm.  But we&#8217;d definitely want to hang them on the wall horizontally.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4735650824_bace82f72f.jpg" alt="WEST ELM FLOOR MIRRORS" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, it  would be nice to use an antique mirror for contrast.  This<br />
<a title="Ruby Lane, London" href="https://www.rubylane.com/" target="_blank">squarish white mirror</a> has a nice heft to it, although it feels a bit shabby.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4734913603_35cd1ea63b.jpg" alt="RUBYLANE ANTIQUE MIRROR" /></p>
<p>I love this <a title="Trouver Antiques" href="https://www.trouverantiques.co.uk/inventory/index.php?c=7" target="_blank">door-shaped mirror</a> with a plaster frame at Trouver Antiques.  It would look pretty on the wall, and also slightly mysterious.  Is there a door behind there, and what does it lead to?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734913359_4ccf02d1b9.jpg" alt="ANTIQUE PLASTER MIRROR" /></p>
<p>This <a title="Restoration Hardware" href="https://rh.com/rh/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1060091&amp;navCount=3" target="_blank">beaded Venetian-style mirror</a> from Restoration Hardware has clean lines and proportions, but I wonder if it&#8217;s wide enough to make an impact on the large wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4735551366_64827f13e7.jpg" alt="RESTORATION HARDAWARE VENETIAN MIRROR" /></p>
<p>How about a shaped mirror? I like the restraint and geometry of this <a title="Restoration Hardware" href="https://restorationhardware.com/" target="_blank">oval mirror</a> from Restoration Hardware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4735551804_c6109e4ba5.jpg" alt="RESTORATION HARDWARE OVAL MIRROR" /></p>
<p>And I like the deep wood frame at this <a title="West Elm" href="https://www.westelm.com/products/w556/?pkey=cmirrors" target="_blank">round, modern mirror</a> from West Elm.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4735650708_465790b885.jpg" alt="WEST ELM ROUND MIRROR" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still worried that all of these mirrors are too small and will be swallowed by that huge wall. The best approach might be to determine how large the mirror needs to be first.  Then we could ask the carpenters to fabricate a wood-framed mirror similar to this <a title="Ikea Molger" href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10154596" target="_blank">Ikea mirror</a>, with similar proportions and a simple profile.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4734913659_2dc19d4438.jpg" alt="IKEA LAVENGER MIRROR" /></p>

<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>

<p>After living in New York City for fifteen years I&#8217;ve become a big fan of apartment living.  It&#8217;s sensible and ecologically sound.  We accumulate fewer things, leave a reduced footprint, and free up space around us for parks and plazas.</p>
<p>Yet my Dream Home has always been a wood frame house.  This might be a memory of my childhood house, a tidy split-level on a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.  And it might reflect my New England upbringing.  I love the simple, taut volumes of colonial homes, broken only by small windows and doors.  My Dream Home is a saltbox with a stubby brick chimney and a red door.  Sometimes I imagine my Dream Home beachside on a grassy field dotted wit hydrangea bushes, and sometimes I imagine it on a square lawn sheltered by maple trees and a low stone fence</p>
<p>It&#8217;s illegal to build a wood frame structure now in New York City. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/realestate/29cov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of nineteenth-century wood houses</a> were carefully maintained, have survived, and are grandfathered into the building code.  There are a few in my neighborhood and each time I pass one it conjures up the Dream Home.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1496 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This house, on East 92nd Street, is at the end of a year-long restoration.  Just the other day it received a final coat of white paint.  For many years it had seemed a bit haunted, with shuttered first floor windows, peeling blue paint, and empty planters.  The rickety wood porch and shutters sagged badly and the whole structure looked as if it were ready to collapse, as if it were being propped up by the two large brick buildings to either side.  Its owners have done a great job fixing the facade, restoring the original wood trim and siding, and adding a low stone patio in front.  I can only wonder what work they&#8217;ve done inside.</p>
<p>As an architect one of the loveliest things to see is a wood house go up.  There&#8217;s something magical about the way the frame emerges from a haze of 2&#215;4&#8217;s, and something reassuring about the way men build it so simply and quickly with hammers and nails. Maybe technological advances will give us a way to construct a wood frame that&#8217;s less vulnerable to the elements, and we can fill empty spots all over the city with small wood houses again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Spring has sprung outside and, finally, inside my apartment.

<p>Spring has sprung outside and, finally, inside my apartment.  I&#8217;ve taken advantage of this blast of warm weather to fling open the windows, roll up my sleeves, and tackle some much needed spring cleaning.</p>
<p>Since remodeling my kitchen and bathroom least year I&#8217;ve been conscientious about keeping these rooms clean and orderly. But the rest of my apartment is as cluttered as is always has been.  There are boxes with old appliances and tableware stuffed underneath the settee in my living room.  There&#8217;s a pile of leftover construction materials in my entryway. And there is, tragically, a canvas tote at the foot of my bed with my Christmas tree, lights and ornaments inside.</p>
<p>I thought I could find room for some of these things in my hall closet so I began there.  I reorganized my shoes, packing up my boots and lace-ups and putting them on the higher shelves.  I moved my sandals down onto lower shelves and unpacked the ones I would wear most frequently.  I filled a bag with old, unused pairs to take to the Salvation Army.  And I found space on the highest shelf for my Christmas decorations.</p>
<p>Then I started sorting through my shirts and dresses, trying to pull out ones that I no longer wear.  There are so many packed in there now that the aluminum pole is sagging dangerously.  Somehow, this was a much more taxing and emotional task for me than sorting through my shoes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m deeply attached to my clothes and have a hard time getting rid of them, even if they&#8217;re entirely unfashionable and don&#8217;t fit properly.  A lot of my shirts and dresses are ones that I made myself, or ones that I feel I could make adjustments to and wear more frequently.    There&#8217;s a seersucker jacket that needs new buttons, shirts that need to be taken in at the sides, and a white blouse that has lost its brightness but could be dyed a darker color.  The truth is that I&#8217;m never going to wear many of these things again, but just can&#8217;t let go of them.</p>
<p>As a sort of compromise, I arranged all the garments on hangers facing left and sorted them by the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet.  So now my closet has a more orderly appearance, although it remains just as crowded as before.  Nonetheless I feel that it was a good start and hope to revisit the closet this weekend.  Wish me luck, and give me strength!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3332/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Now I understand why power tools are called power tools: because they make the person using them feel powerful.</p>
<p>This weekend I installed brackets and rods for new curtains in my living room, something I&#8217;d been meaning to do and procrastinating about for four months.  I kept saying to myself that I liked the fresh, uncluttered feeling of the room without curtains.  Then one night as I was sitting alone watching TV I looked outside across the courtyard into a neighbor&#8217;s apartment and directly at my neighbor, who shot me a glance of disapproval before drawing his blinds.  I knew I needed to put up curtains.</p>
<p>My friend Lenore, a resourceful homeowner who installed her own kitchen flooring, offered to lend me her electric drill.  Walking back home from her apartment with the drill and its bits weighing down my shoulder bag made me feel a little bit dangerous, as if I were carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no stranger to power tools.  I took wood shop and metal shop in grade school, where I learned to use a band saw, sanding machines, and welding tools.  In architecture school, to complete models and prototypes, I constructed plywood framework, poured concrete, and carved massing models from solid wood.  But there was something intimidating about bringing power tools into my own home, and taking a drill to my own wall.</p>
<p>Lenore&#8217;s drill was impressively banged up: scratched, stained and dusty.  It looked lived in, as if it had been through battles with her.  Although it was heavy it felt comfortable in my hands.  When I was perched at the top of the ladder on Saturday afternoon, wearing oversized sunglasses in lieu of goggles, drilling holes at the intersections of carefully penciled guidelines, I felt anxious but also powerful.  The first few holes I drilled were a little wobbly, not exactly perpendicular and not exactly round.  But the final holes I drilled were just about perfect.  I now feel like a master, or mistress, of the power drill.</p>
<p>Just like every girl needs to have access to a sewing machine to do simple things like hemming and mending, every girl needs a power drill to do simple things like hanging paintings and installing hooks.  Now I&#8217;m ready to go out and get one of my own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This apartment would benefit from a soft, bright palette of materials to  keep the rooms, which receive most of their light from the back  windows, light and airy.</p>
<p>I would start by painting the walls and ceiling in an off-white color and installing a durable, light-colored flooring material throughout.  Maple and bamboo are both good choices.  With a natural stain and light varnish the fine grain of these woods shows through and they&#8217;re easy to clean.  A simple wood base of the same material wood will give the walls a neat finish.  The new wood doors, door frames, and window frames would be finished to match.  For the kitchen I&#8217;d use cork floor tiles, which are soft to stand and work on, modern maple cabinets, and dark countertops.  For the bathroom I&#8217;d stick to traditional white ceramic fixtures, and use black and white ceramic tiles on the wainscot and floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="174" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>A cream- and honey-colored palette for furniture complements the wood flooring and also adds warmth.  Contemporary pieces that stand up off the floor keep things feeling light and airy. I&#8217;d mix in a few more substantial pieces too, perhaps a coffee table from reclaimed wood, or an old-fashioned upholstered sofa.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Full-height sheer white curtains along the back wall will provide privacy while letting in lots of light.  I&#8217;d use simple bulb-shaped ceiling mounted light fixtures, and hang a special, more ornamental one above the main living or dining area.  Darker colored wool rugs or sisal mats can soften the living areas and pull seating arrangements together.  Brightly colored pillows, wall hangings and throws will add depth and cheer to the rooms.  Red, orange and brown would all be strong accent colors.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="343" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This apartment is going to make a stylish, comfortable  home for someone.  I can&#8217;t wait for her to come in and start sweetening!</p>

<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>

<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>

<p>My old boss used to say that for every project an architect has three equally-important priorities: cost, quality and schedule.</p>
<p>As I began my remodel, maybe because of my background in design, quality seemed paramount.  Cost was the second concern. Because I had other places to stay during construction, time was the final consideration.</p>
<p>As I moved through the project, though, cost became the overriding concern.  Initially, flushed with optimism, I made payments for materials and services without a fuss.  But as the project moved forward and the total cost crept closer and closer to my limit, I became increasingly suspect about spending money and searched more passionately for less costly substitutions.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the smaller, more ornamental elements.  I spent a little extra money to get a faucet set for my bathroom sink from a high end supplier.  But I didn&#8217;t order the supplier&#8217;s matching toilet paper holder and towel bars because I couldn&#8217;t justify the extra expense for such simple pieces of hardware.  I returned a beautiful towel shelf I had ordered because, when the time came to install it, it felt too opulent.  Instead of ordering kitchen cabinet pulls from the supplier I bought them in bulk at a hardware store.</p>
<p>I was especially alarmed by surprise costs, which came fast and furious at the end of the project.  My building management company mailed me an invoice for the cost of their &#8220;Architectural Review,&#8221; which they had not told me about.  I had to order extra wood panels from the cabinet supplier to complete the installation.  And I needed a myriad of small, last-minute items from the hardware store like a shower curtain rod and a lever for my toilet tank.  Each time I pulled out my credit card I winced.</p>
<p>As in many other things, what helped most was to step back and take a larger view. The remodel was an investment that would ultimately increase the value of my home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-759" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG" alt="Tiling" width="540" height="668" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Architects tend to be perfectionists and also indecisive, which is a dangerous combination.  In the architecture offices where I worked I spent hours locked in conference rooms with colleagues agonizing about the height of a baseboard, the profile of a window mullion, and the location of a light switch.</p>
<p>These are details that aren&#8217;t important to a client and don&#8217;t often affect the overall impact of a project.  But architects agonize over things like this; it&#8217;s part of what they do.  For my kitchen remodel I spent hours deciding between different cherry wood stains, different shades of white paint, and different cabinet door knobs.</p>
<p>In the end details that I thought were highly important were not carried out.  For my bathroom I thought it was crucial to reproduce the tiny 1/32&#8243; tile grout joints from the original walls.  A typical ceramic wall tile grout joint is 1/8&#8243; but I felt that this size joint was simply too wide, too crude, and that it would detract from the beauty of the tile.  I even had a bad dream about it.  In this dream I returned to my bathroom after a week-long holiday and found my shower walls finished with 1/2&#8243; tile joints.  I awoke with a start!</p>
<p>In the end, almost as a comeuppance, my bathroom was completed with 1/8&#8243; grout joints.  This was entirely my own fault.  The tiler began his work very early one morning, before I or the site supervisor could speak to him.  I&#8217;ll never forget walking onto site that day and seeing all the tile laid out on my bathroom walls, absolutely beautifully, and set apart with 1/8&#8243; spacers.  The mason was beaming.  He turned to me and said, &#8220;Look at how much I&#8217;ve completed already.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t ask him to redo the work; he&#8217;d done exactly what was expected.  So instead I took a very deep breath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg" alt="Tile Comparison" width="540" height="156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>In the end the bathroom walls turned out beautifully.  The cream-colored grout that we had selected in order to miminize staining brought out a golden hue in the glaze of the tile.  The original 1/32&#8243; joints that I had wanted had created a colder, more clinical surface.  The 1/8&#8243; joints, which I had abhorred, gave the entire room a warmer, more welcoming feeling.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-749" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ON-THE-ROAD.JPG" alt="The Rolling Suitcase" width="540" height="336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ON-THE-ROAD.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ON-THE-ROAD-300x187.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ON-THE-ROAD-288x180.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Whenever someone tells me they&#8217;re starting a home remodeling project I tell them the three things that I&#8217;ve learned in my fifteen years working as an architect.  1.  It will cost more than you expect.  2.  It will take longer than you expect.  3.  It will turn out better than you expect.</p>
<p>Yet when it came to my own remodel didn&#8217;t want to accept that second bit of wisdom.  Each of the contractors I interviewed told me that my remodel would take three weeks, and I believed it.  In the end it took seven full weeks to complete the construction work.  This is through no fault of the contractor&#8217;s.  There were some surprises during demolition and construction that required extra time to handle.</p>
<p>I was lucky because a number of friends invited me stay at their places while work was being done.  And my parents live just an hour  outside of New York.  I knew that I could stay with them for as long as required and commute into the city each day to monitor construction.  At first this &#8220;homelessness&#8221; was sort of fun, like a series of small vacations.  I got to explore different neighborhoods in the city: the Upper West Side, the Lower East Side, Union Square and Park Slope.  I spent quality time with friends and a lovely, relaxing week with my parents.</p>
<p>But after two weeks the novelty of being a vagabond wore off.  Before beginning demolition the contractors had sealed off my clothes closet with blue tape to prevent dust infiltration, so I was limited to the clothes I had packed in my suitcase.  And I had packed very badly, throwing together casual summer clothes in a rolling suitcase.  Then the weather turned and I was invited to some more formal parties and I found it impossible to dress properly.  I wore paint-splattered jeans to  a chi-chi fashion industry event, and flip-flops to a dinner date.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a creature of habit; a disciplined environment helps me to remain focused and productive.  This apartment remodel disrupted every aspect of my life, it shook up my routines of sleeping, bathing, dressing, eating and socializing.  The resulting sense of displacement, both physical and emotional, was unnerving and entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>Mid-way through the project, after demolition was complete and before finishes and fixtures had been installed, was the most difficult time.  At that moment it felt as things would never return to normal,  that I would be rolling around that suitcase forever.</p>

<p>I visited Kuwait, briefly, in 2006 and the entire place felt as if it were immersed in a dust storm.   I couldn&#8217;t see clearly more than ten feet in any direction because of sand motes suspended in the air.  On top of this there was a sharp, dry smell, as if from distant fires.  I sensed that the place had seen terrible destruction.  My home feels a little like that right now.</p>
<p>As I write this I&#8217;m sitting at a dust-coated desk, in my dust-filled bedroom, brushing dust off my keyboard, and breathing  dust into my lungs.  I&#8217;m perpetually brushing my clothes and rinsing my hands, unable to feel that they&#8217;re clean.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I expected, demolition was not the dirtiest stage of the remodel.  Demolition produced debris that could be piled up, bagged, and left at the curb.  It&#8217;s the final woodwork, plasterwork, and sanding that has been more difficult to control.  They release a fine dust that clings to every surface and makes it difficult to see from one end of a room the other.  Just as my remodel is reaching completion, I&#8217;m enveloped in a blinding construction fog.</p>
<p>The construction workers have been careful about keeping my furniture covered, sealing off my closets with blue tape, and cleaning the site periodically.  But there might not be no escape from this fine dust, which finds its way behind doors and drop-cloths, into cabinets and storage bins.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fastidious housekeeper.  The ceiling-high piles of debris in my living room after demolition didn&#8217;t bother me so much.  Nor do the footprints on my carpets or the wear on my floors.  But this construction dust is disconcerting because there seems to be no escape from it. Looking back, I should have sealed off all the floors, furniture, and closets in my apartment very carefully before construction began.  It would have saved me some worry and a whole lot of cleaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-596 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PROJECT-FILES.jpg" alt="PROJECT FILES" width="540" height="606" />When I manage a construction project in an architecture office I am terrifically, annoyingly organized. I respond to phone calls and emails immediately. I keep and file printed copies of all documents I receive and send. I develop filing systems so that all project documents are easy to find.</p>
<p>But when I began my home remodel I seemed to abandon all of these practices. I began with a bang, creating a binder with carefully labeled sections for existing conditions drawings, design sketches, product specifications, and reference images. I carried this binder with me as I shopped for products, packed it in my suitcase when I traveled, and left it on an end table right by my desk, so that I could reach it at any moment.</p>
<p>But before long I had much more information than could be stored in the binder. Piles sprang up around the binder, on top of it and on the floor below, piles of plumbing fixture catalogues, cabinet specifications, and outdated drawings. Eventually tile samples and paint chips found their way into these piles, and then cost estimates and invoices. The piles got higher and started spilling into one another and then into other, unrelated piles in my bedroom, piles of unsorted mail and trashy magazines. As a result there are no real project files for my home remodel project, only project piles.</p>
<p>When working in an office I keep a typed project directory, which lists the contact information for all the contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers on a project, and update the document weekly. For my home remodel I just slipped all the relevant business cards I had collected in a plastic sleeve, although I believe that there are still a few important ones swimming around at the bottom of my purse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-615 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PROJECT-DIRECTORY.jpg" alt="PROJECT DIRECTORY" width="540" height="671" /></p>
<p>Most of my communication with vendors and suppliers was through email, and most of my communication with my contractor Martin and his team was over the phone. Although I prefer email contractors always seem to prefer the phone. (Since my contractor Martin and the site supervisors, Brian and Joe, are Irish, it is always a pleasure to answer the phone and hear their lovely brogues, regardless of what they were actually saying to me.)</p>
<p>There were no scheduled site meetings but almost every morning I met with Brian and Joe and we talked about what work would be done that day and what steps would come next. They followed the drawings carefully but called me whenever they had specific questions. (Which way should the medicine cabinet door open? How thick is the kitchen countertop?) Martin came to the site about once each week, often after work hours, to review progress and discuss the schedule. Because it was a small remodel and a small team, this informal way of working worked well.</p>
<p>That is not the case with my record-keeping. Maybe because this project is so close to me, so personal, I abandoned my office habits and tried to manage it in a less regimental, hands-on way. It&#8217;s not something I would recommend. Keeping good records is the only way to track decisions and costs accurately. For my next remodel project, I&#8217;ll be sure to bring a more professional attitude to doing filing and paperwork.</p>
