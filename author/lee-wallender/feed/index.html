			<h2>Want an eco-friendly remodel? Consider these methods to improve your L.A. home&#8217;s energy and water efficiency</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1.jpg" alt="Remodeled dining area in Los Angeles with wood flooring and fresh white walls" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49426 size-full" title="Sustainable home remodeling in Los Angeles" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovating a house in L.A.’s extreme climate requires special measures. </span>Heat is intense during the summer and water is always in a shortage. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors offer advice on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable home remodeling</a> in Los Angeles with energy and water conservation in mind.</p>
<h3>Energy conservation in L.A.</h3>
<p>“Energy conservation and cool conservation are the same thing,” said L.A.-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Chen</a>. If you can adequately cool the home, you have gone a long way toward conserving the heat, too. The best place to start conserving heat is with airtightness.</p>
<h3>Airtightness</h3>
<p>“Think of your house as a bucket of water,” said Chen. “If you have any holes in the bucket, that’s water escaping from the bucket. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/air-sealing-your-home">Airtightness</a> is the same with your home.”</p>
<p>The aim is to prevent conditioned interior air from escaping—whether cool or warm air. There are airtight home products that can help with this. For instance, caulk is used around stationary home elements like door and window frames. Weatherstripping is also used for movable components, such as the door itself or the window sash.</p>
<h3>Home insulation types</h3>
<p>Home insulation is a requirement for all new construction and remodeled homes. Whether holding in heated or cooled air, a wide range of home insulation projects can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6071#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Jose</a>, also based in Los Angeles, noted that spray foam insulation is becoming increasingly popular. Spray foam insulation is especially good for vaulted ceilings since it conforms to voids in the building envelope.</p>
<p>“More people are adopting spray foam insulation,” said Jose, “though it is a little bit dirtier than some other types of insulation,” meaning that foam will off-gas. But in the end, he noted, when you do a cost-benefit analysis, you might come out ahead environmentally.</p>
<p>While fiberglass is still the main type of home insulation used in remodels, it’s not the only product out there. Every so often, he will use denim insulation, mainly because it is eco-friendly and excellent for soundproofing.</p>
<h3>Home heating and cooling systems</h3>
<p>That traditional feature of Southern California side yards—the hulking HVAC unit—may soon pass into oblivion.</p>
<p>VRF (variable refrigerant flow) units are far smarter and more green than central units, which heat or cool the entire house at once. “These are far better than traditional central air,” said Chen. “These products adapt to the areas of the house where you need the heat or cooling.”</p>
<p>As an example, you might have <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 5-bedroom house</a> with separate variable refrigerant flow units in each room. All units are connected to one large outdoor unit. This unit senses the needs and knows how to provide each unit with the right amount of heating or cooling.</p>
<h3>Underfloor heating</h3>
<p>In extremely cold climates, underfloor heating exists only to make your bare feet more comfortable on tile. But in moderately cool climates such as L.A.’s, underfloor heating can be used for heating rooms. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most common installation</a> of underfloor heating is in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeten contractor Chen said, “When you think about the physics of heating, heat goes up. So heat that starts at the floor is most effective.” Chen finds that the most efficient and sustainable type is water-based (hydronic) radiant heating systems, rather than electric cable systems.</p>
<h4>Using solar power for home heating and cooling</h4>
<p>The final and necessary component of home heating and cooling is solar power.</p>
<p>Los Angeles general contractor Jose does a lot of solar installations but it always depends on the clients’ budgets. He added that many clients like to go off-grid in terms of power. But off-grid doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re isolated out in the country. These are homes in the metro area.</p>
<p>Solar power helps reduce the power draw for heating and cooling systems. Robust solar power systems even allow the homeowner to sell back credits to the power company.</p>
<h3>Water conservation at home in L.A.</h3>
<p>With water being so precious in L.A. and across all of Southern California, water conservation in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home remodels</a> is no longer a choice; it’s a given. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors have a number</a> of weather-conserving initiatives to use during remodeling.</p>
<h4>What is greywater?</h4>
<p>Greywater is any residential wastewater that isn’t septic waste (water from toilets or urinals). Greywater can be drainage from bathtubs, showers, kitchen and bathroom sinks, washing machines, or dishwashers.</p>
<p>Depending on clients’ budgets, Sweeten contractor Jose often does greywater reuse installations. At this time, greywater reuse is only approved for irrigation in Southern California.</p>
<p>Tax credits for greywater reuse may be available. But he cautions that credits likely won’t cover the cost of the greywater reuse installations—at least not for the first few years.</p>
<h4>Rainwater collection</h4>
<p>Contrary to popular thought, it does rain in Southern California. Just ask a resident during one of the El Niño periods from September to November. Some years get up to <a href="http://www.laalmanac.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 to 40 inches of rain</a>, according to the Los Angeles Almanac.</p>
<p>Rainwater collection can be as easy as purchasing rain barrels on your own to collect water runoff from the roof. Or you can speak with your contractor about larger capacity water harvesting systems as a sustainable solution.</p>
<h4>Los Angeles water conservation rebates &amp; credits</h4>
<p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has <a href="https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/residential/r-savemoney/r-sm-rebatesandprograms;jsessionid=KyJZhcbFtkrjGLg79Lp998y7rMQYm8CLfVTnKsr2vcnsJJHJ2p55!415314039?_afrLoop=298325548010414&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D298325548010414%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dy0dogbh89_4">rebate programs that may help compensate</a> you for water conservation remodels. You may be able to be rebated for drought-tolerant landscapes or high-efficiency eco-friendly washing machines. Read up on the full range of credits and rebates and discuss what your <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">options are with your contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready to get started</a> on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors in LA</span>.</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">From challenges and solutions to expanding square footage and tips on preparing for the process</h2>

<p class="p3">The character of Philadelphia is <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/history-of-american-row-houses-8600298c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined by its rowhouse streetscapes</a>. Rowhouses are space-efficient, compact, and often cost-effective. Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse comes with its share of joys and challenges. Sweeten lays out what you can expect with renovating these historic buildings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">What is a rowhouse in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p class="p3">A Philadelphia rowhouse is an urban one-to-four-story house that has a narrow front exterior. Rowhouses are attached to similar rowhouses on both sides.</p>
<p class="p3">Philadelphia has more rowhouses than any other type of housing structure. Designed as an inexpensive way to house Philadelphia’s rapidly growing industrial population, rowhouses have become desired, premium properties.</p>
<p class="p3">Some Philly rowhouses are quite large. Rittenhouse Square mansions can be as huge as 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. Most Philadelphia rowhouses are small to moderate in size, though. Trinities and Bandboxes (smaller versions of Trinities) can be as tiny as 400 to 600 square feet. Two-story rowhouses in Center City, South and North Philadelphia, and Manayunk can range from 1,000 to 1,600 square feet.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse: Challenges and solutions</h3>
<p class="p3">Because Philly rowhouses are unique, renovating them can present challenges. But to an experienced contractor, solving these issues is just a part of the daily work of creativity and flexibility.</p>
<p class="p3">Philly-area-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6753#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor <span class="s1">John</span></a> calls his approach “bob and weave,” after a boxer’s split-second, nimble approach to punches that come their way. “Rowhouses don’t always need to be more difficult,” said John, “because we try to be flexible.”</p>
<p class="p3">John cites his approach to debris removal as an example. It’s no problem to park rolloff dumpsters in the driveway of a suburban single-family detached house; you just do it. But when a dumpster needs to be parked on a public street, all sorts of permitting issues arise.</p>
<p class="p3">John’s solution is to cycle out debris every day. “A hauling company picks up the daily load and some of my guys have trucks, too, so they can move debris.”</p>
<p class="p3">Narrow doorways are obstacles to moving in building materials and appliances. Sometimes the old 30-inch doorways have been widened already. When they haven’t, John calls this one of his biggest problems with rowhouse remodels. But he can always find workarounds by temporarily removing door trim or by unboxing appliances.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Ways to increase square footage in rowhouses</h3>
<p class="p3">Squeezed in on both sides, the average rowhouse is fairly small. So, remodels need to be creative. Some contractors build soffits (or bulkheads) over exposed pipes, wires, and vents. However, doing this reduces space. “We like to avoid building soffits,” say<span class="s1">s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6510#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Mario</a>, who is based in Philadelphia</span>, “and most homeowners don’t want soffits, either.”</p>
<p class="p3">So, Mario finds it worthwhile to reroute pipes and electrical through walls and ceilings. “It gives it a cleaner look and that’s what people want.” In some cases, Mario will push out a wall or ceiling a smidge. “If the ceiling is 10 feet or more, we might drop the ceiling just a little to run services through there.”</p>
<p class="p3">For homeowners who want more room, there is always more space to be had in the back or upward. “Pilot houses,” says Mario, referring to rooftop decks, “are one of the most popular ways to expand upward.” Plus, he sees some clients purchasing two adjacent rowhouse units and removing the wall between the two. This effectively doubles the rowhouse square footage.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Permitting and approvals for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</h3>
<p class="p3">With most substantial Philadelphia rowhouse remodels, you&#8217;ll need permits. Any alteration that costs $10,000 or more requires drawings of the proposed construction. These drawings must have the seal or stamp of a licensed architect or engineer.</p>
<p class="p3">Sweeten general contractors can refer an architect if the services of one are needed. Having an experienced architect and general contractor by your side will help you move through the permitting process more easily.</p>
<p class="p3">Not every Philly rowhouse is a historically designated structure. However, thousands of them are. If yours is one, you’ll need to seek authorization and go through a separate approval process with the Philadelphia Historic Commission.</p>
<p class="p3">Check the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/documents/philadelphia-register-of-historic-places" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Philadelphia Register of Historic Places</span></a> to see if your home is designated as historic.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>4 tips for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Be ready for costlier materials<br />
</b>Renovating a newer home means that you can use a wide range of materials. Many homeowners can find off-the-shelf materials at the local home center to use. But historic Philly rowhouses have masonry, molding, trim, ornamental metals, walls, and ceilings of a more specialized—and costly—nature. Prepare by padding your materials budget.</li>
<li><b>Be available<br />
</b>Remodeling a Philly rowhouse isn’t a “set it and forget it” project. Be available and responsive to everyone working on your project, including the architect, contractor, or project manager.</li>
<li><b>Predict the unpredictable<br />
</b>Prepare yourself and your budget for contract <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/how-do-i-document-change-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change orders</a> (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon). Change orders help your remodel project adapt to unexpected discoveries along the way.</li>
<li><b>Rely on your experts<br />
</b>Unless your daily job is renovating rowhouses, the experts you’ve hired know more than you do. After all, they do this on a daily basis. You’re not just hiring a pair of hands; you’re taking advantage of years of experience and knowledge.</li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carrara vs Calacatta Marble: What are they?</span></h3>
<h4>Carrara marble</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble is an off-white or blue-gray softly veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Historically, Carrara marble can be seen in statues and in large public and commercial buildings. However, Carrara marble is now more commonplace in residential homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The core, or field, of Carrara marble is light-gray, with vague bluish tones. The streaks, called veins, are light-gray, too. The veins are slightly darker than the field. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The veins found in Carrara marble are subtle, not pronounced. Instead, they are soft, watery, or feathery. Carrara marble veins seem to continue and dissipate into the field.</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is a type of Carrara marble. It comes from the same overall region of Tuscany, Italy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble tends to have a white field. Usually, the whiter the field, the more expensive the marble.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The feature that distinguishes Calacatta marble is its veining. Calacatta’s veins are thick, bold, defined, and often colorful. Calacatta marble’s veins range from dark-gray and beige up to darker browns and even gold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta has few veins, but those veins stand out in sharp contrast to the white field.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Should you choose Carrara or Calacatta marble?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners who desire the overall look of marble, but want a more understated look, should choose Carrara marble. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble does an excellent job of blending into the room as a whole rather than calling attention to itself. Because Carrara takes more of a backseat, it can be used across large expanses for walls and flooring.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is for homeowners who want to show off this unique, gorgeous stone. It’s a marble that truly looks the way marble should look.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because Calacatta marble is all about its veins, it is well-suited to bookmatching. Bookmatching pairs two marble slabs from the same cut so that adjacent slabs mirror each other. This gives the appearance of an open book. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble’s distinctive veins make bookmatching possible. With Carrara marble, you can bookmatch slabs, but the effect may not be evident.</span></p>
<h3>Calacatta vs Carrara Cost: Which is more expensive?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nobody can call marble a &#8220;bargain&#8221; building material. However, Carrara marble is far less expensive than Calacatta marble; around half the price.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of marble</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Premium building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High resale value<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Unique, every slab is different<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Natural building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Lasts long with proper maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Cons</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Expensive<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Soft, chips easily<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heavy<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Stains<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Requires maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is marble popular?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All building materials have their trends. But <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/kitchens/a8981/cons-marble-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble’s popularity remains more stable</a> than other materials. In fact, no other material looks quite like it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For some homes, marble isn’t just the best choice, it’s the only choice. Marble is frequently the go-to pick for high-end houses with a classic or traditional style. It doesn’t hurt that marble’s history is rich and deep, as marble is associated with Roman buildings and classic sculptures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Functionally, marble is dense, heavy, and permanent. It resists heat well. It’s also more commonly found than one might think. Italy produces Carrara and Calacatta marble, but Spain, India, China, Turkey, Greece, and the U.S. also produce other types of marble.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of a bathtub with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Best uses of marble in the home: </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><b></b>Kitchen counters: Use marble as your main kitchen countertop material.</li>
<li>Kitchen island counters: Pair the main kitchen counters with a slab of <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble on the kitchen island</a>. Or use marble alone here.</li>
<li>Kitchen or bathroom backsplashes: Marble works well for backsplashes in the kitchen (though not behind the stove) or behind the bathroom sink.</li>
<li>Entry or foyer hallways: Marble has long been used in foyers, lobbies, and other entry rooms as a show-stopper to welcome visitors.</li>
<li>Bathtub or shower surrounds: Marble is waterproof when sealed, making it a perfect fit for shower or bathtub wall surrounds.</li>
<li>Bathroom floor tile: Marble is a hardy floor covering for bathrooms, plus it stands up well to water.</li>
<li class="li3">Fireplace surrounds: Polished marble can be used for fireplace surrounds as it can be wiped clean.<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to clean marble and maintain it</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You should always seal marble used around the home. Keep the stone regularly sealed. When drops of water no longer bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Acidic liquids can etch marble. Avoid having vinegar, citrus, or tomatoes sit on the marble for very long. Clean them up quickly. Use cutting boards.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clean marble with gentle methods. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth. Look for a good cleaner designed just for marble. Never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on the marble.</span></p>

 <div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752036182"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is Carrara marble?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Carrara marble is a veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Carrara marble was historically used for statues and public and commercial buildings, but in modern times, it is used in residential houses. Carrara marble is off-white or blue-gray in color, with streaks (or “veins”) of light gray which are slightly darker than the core color. The veins in Carrara are subtle, as opposed to the bold, deep veins found in Calacatta marble.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752049921"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How to clean Carrara marble</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Always clean marble with gentle methods–never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on marble as the surface is soft and chips easily. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth using a cleaner designed just for marble. </p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752063615"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Carrara marble need to be sealed?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, Carrara marble needs to be sealed. Test whether you need to re-seal your marble by dropping beads of water onto its surface. If the water does not bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752078287"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Is Carrara marble good for bathroom vanity?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Carrara marble can be used as a bathroom vanity topper, as it stands up well to water, but needs to be maintained carefully. Since marble is a soft stone that etches and chips easily, avoid using abrasive materials or acidic liquids while cleaning its surface.</p> </div> </div> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/">The Difference Between Carrara and Calacatta Marble</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://sweeten.com">Sweeten</a>.</p>

All of the walls and the flooring are sealed against water, just like the surfaces in a typical shower stall. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main flooring of the wet room is on the same level as the shower floor. The section of the wet room where the shower is located has a floor with a sharp slope to aid with water drainage. The rest of the bathroom floor is sloped toward the same drain. But the floor slope is more gradual.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because there is so much water, bathroom facilities such as the toilet and sink are either raised or are water-sealed.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Due to how wet rooms work, the function of the room is prioritized over the style. Subsequently, most wet room design is clean and spare.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are wet rooms so popular?</span></h3><ul><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Frameless showers let in more light. These use sheets of thick, unframed glass to surround the shower in a wet room. They make</span><span class="s1"> the whole room lighter and airier. </span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Since wet rooms are designed with excellent ventilation, they typically see less mold and mildew growth.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet rooms are much easier to clean. There are no cramped enclosures to deal with, and the whole floor can be hosed down.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room bathrooms are ready for all phases of a person’s life. There are no steps or curbs keeping walkers and wheelchairs out of the shower area. The toilet area merges seamlessly with the shower, too. </span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of wet rooms</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pros</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathroom feels brighter and more spacious because it has fewer walls and barriers.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The floor is easy to clean—all water can be directed to a single drain.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Accessibility: there is no shower curb or bathtub wall to step over. </span><span class="s1">Wet room designs comply with many <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aging-in-place design rules.</a><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s less chance of mold, mildew, and water decay.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathing area does not steam up because it is not enclosed.<br /></span></li></ul><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cons</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Splashes from the shower can go everywhere.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s best to have plenty of space, to keep the shower separate from dry areas.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">In smaller bathrooms, dry areas need to be made water-resistant.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It can feel colder in the shower, since there&#8217;s no enclosure to hold in heat.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The need for more tile work may increase costs.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">They can be acoustically loud and bright because of the open design and hard materials.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Most things stored in the bathroom need to be enclosed in water-resistant cabinets.<br /></span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Features and special considerations</span></h3><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Shower enclosures</b>: Many wet room bathrooms are built without any shower enclosures. However, you can opt for an open enclosure with no door. Or you can add a half-wall to minimize splashing.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom storage</b>: Locating storage and linen cabinets outside of the bathroom is one way to deal with moisture. Another is to install water-resistant cabinets in the room.<br /></span></li><li><span class="s1"><b>Large wet rooms</b>: If you have a big enough space, you may be able to store moisture-sensitive items in the bathroom without special cabinets. </span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Radiant heating</b>: You can install <a href="https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/7-myths-about-radiant-heat-debunked-49301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiant floor heating</a> even though the floor will see plenty of water. Special underfloor radiant heating kits are available.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Raised sink cabinet</b>: Pedestal sinks or cantilevered countertops are ideal choices for keeping cabinetry off the floor.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Relocated heating register</b>: Heating vents cannot be built into the floor. Either build the vents into walls or use another type of heating.<br /></span></li></ul><p>When you&#8217;re ready to begin your bathroom or home remodel, discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor if a wet room</a> is possible in your space.</p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wet room bathroom maintenance and cleaning</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners may worry about installing wet room bathrooms on upper floors. Yet a professionally installed wet room is no different than locating a freestanding shower on an upper floor. The waterproofing methods are the same—just on a larger scale. Be aware that just like with any bathroom, a wet room could eventually spring a leak and require maintenance.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room floors are easy to clean. You can clean the flooring with a mild floor cleaner and a rubber-bladed mop. Start on the far end of the room and push water toward the shower drain. You can also use a hand-held shower head as a hose.  </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Walls in regular bathrooms can be difficult to clean, especially when they&#8217;re made of drywall or plaster. Wet room walls are hardscaped and water-sealed. So, you can clean them with soap and water without fear of damage.</span></p><p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally. If you’re in the NY/NJ metro area, in-stock items typically deliver within 2-3 days.</p><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"></div><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"></div></div></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Get started gathering details you&#8217;ll need: the front porch design, the permits, and the renovation process</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Queens rowhouse" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Outdoor space with potential</h3>
<p class="p1">As the initial “space” to welcome your guests, the front porch sets the first impression. Much like a foyer, it’s an extension of your interior home before entering the main living area. Turning a porch into a place to relax and socialize would expand the living square footage. As a result, upgrading a front porch will add to your home’s value as well as its curb appeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Read on for Sweeten’s pros and cons on porch types, what goes into a porch remodel, and the starting costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5">Remodeling a front porch: 6 types to choose from</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch must address your needs. In addition, the front porch should be a seamless addition to the house. Keep your front porch stylistically in line with the rest of the home. This assists with permit applications. Also, it helps the front porch blend in better with the home.</p>
<h4>Covered open front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A covered open front porch is the most popular, classic type of porch. Many homeowners first think about open porches when they imagine a porch design. This porch has a roof or overhang that is attached to the house. Though this porch has no walls, it often has a railing that helps to define the space and to keep users safe.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Traditional</li>
<li class="li2">Unobtrusive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Does not protect you from insects</li>
<li class="li2">Partially open to the elements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Screened front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A screened front porch is a covered front porch that has a metal or fiberglass insect screen in its open areas. A screen door fills in the open door area. Screened front porches are highly desired in areas that have mosquitoes and other insects. Building a screened front porch is essential to enjoying your porch from spring to fall.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Protection against insects</li>
<li class="li2">Inexpensive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Screen may tear</li>
<li class="li2">Some rain may still enter the porch</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enclosed front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">With an enclosed front porch, the walls are semi-solid, much like a sunroom. Often, the lower part of the sunroom walls is solid. The porch’s upper section is devoted to window glass or to insect screens.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Extends usage through the seasons</li>
<li class="li2">Electrical wiring is possible for outlets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Less of an open, airy feeling</li>
<li class="li2">Can be difficult to keep cool</li>
</ul>
<h4>Full wrap-around front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">A full wrap-around front porch is any porch that partially wraps across the side of the house. This porch may wrap around two sides (front and side of the house) to form an L-shape. Or the porch may wrap across three sides to form a U-shape.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Integrates well with the overall house design</li>
<li class="li2">More floor space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More expensive</li>
<li class="li2">Blocks some house windows’ access to direct light</li>
</ul>
<h4>Entertainment front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An entertainment front porch is a variation of any porch. This variation includes accessories such as an outdoor kitchen, bar, hot tub, gas fireplace, or TV. Some of the entertainment features can be placed on open-air additions to the porch.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">More space for socializing</li>
<li class="li2">More activities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">May be difficult to recoup investment upon sale</li>
<li class="li2">Accessories require greater maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Open-air front porch</h4>
<p class="p2">An open-air front porch is an uncovered off-shoot to any type of covered porch. This adjacent, connected porch allows for other activities. These might be activities that work better in the open air than in enclosed spaces. These activities might include an open-pit fireplace, recreational space for exercising, or a larger hot tub.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Adds flexibility to the porch</li>
<li class="li2">Creates <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the feeling of a deck</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">Increases porch’s cost</li>
<li class="li2">Greater weathering due to lack of cover</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Basic timeline</h3>
<h4>Set your budget, scope, and renovation team</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose the type of front porch remodel you&#8217;ll do by asking yourself a few questions. Firstly, what activity do you imagine yourself doing on your front porch? Do you think you will be on the porch mostly in the spring, and only infrequently? Then, you may want a covered open front porch. Can you imagine yourself on the front porch all through the summer? In that case, choose a screened or enclosed front porch.</li>
<li>Begin looking for a contractor&#8217;s portfolio of work. Read client testimonials and online reviews. Sweeten can help <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">match you with the right general contractor</a> in scope, location, and budget.</li>
<li>Know your budget. How much do you want to spend? As expected, homeowners like to control the cost of the porch remodel. One way to do this is to only spend available funds. But if you expect that the porch will increase curb appeal enough to boost resale value, then costs will be on the higher end.</li>
<li>Begin <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting with contractors</a>. Ask about contractors’ schedules and about expected start times. Most importantly, make sure that the contractor is one who shares your vision and is one you can work with.</li>
<li>Sign a contract with a contractor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The renovation process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the contractor’s schedule, work may begin immediately. A company will deliver a roll-off dumpster to your property. Workers will begin demolishing some or all of your porch. For small amounts of debris, a hauling company may come instead.</li>
<li>The crew first dig the holes. Then, concrete is poured for the footers. Posts are attached to the concrete footers. These posts, plus a ledger board on the house, support the porch.</li>
<li>After the concrete has cured, workers install beams and posts.</li>
<li>Flooring is installed. Your front porch flooring might be an exotic wood or a composite wood. Unless this is a fully enclosed front porch, it is usually best to install durable, weather-resistant flooring.</li>
<li>The railing and screen are installed if it is a screened front porch. If it is an open porch, usually only a railing is installed. For more elaborate front porches, semi-solid walls may be added.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p5">Permits and restrictions</h3>
<p class="p2">Most communities require you to obtain a building permit for any substantial modification to your porch. Your contractor can give you advice on whether your front porch remodeling idea will require a permit.</p>
<p class="p2">In cities that have historic preservation and historic landmark overlays, you may need to apply for an additional preservation permit. These permit applications usually require a full set of plans, elevations, and photos.</p>
<p class="p2">If your house is in a housing association neighborhood, the HOA board must approve your project. HOAs tend to carefully look at how the proposed front porch remodel fits in with other houses’ front porches. Also, rules regarding home alterations should be specified in your HOA documentation. You should have received these documents when you bought the house.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Cost to remodel a front porch</h3>
<p class="p2">Any front porch remodeling idea that remains basic and uses few materials can start at $10,000—$15,000. This type of front porch is usually not enclosed. For remodels of this type, the railing might be replaced and the porch is painted. Depending on the size of the space, new materials, and the amenities being added, costs can go as high as $50,000 and more.</p>
<p>As an extension of the interior of the house, the porch is more than a path to the front door. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your front porch or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In Houston, home additions are a great way to increase the square footage of a house</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg" alt="exterior of a Houston house addition" width="2560" height="1920" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50209" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Are you living in a home of good size, but need more space? Whether it’s creating another bedroom or increasing the living area, adding onto your property can seem like a complex undertaking. Houston home additions require careful planning and due diligence. With the right general contractor in Houston to manage the approvals and remodeling process, you can realize the potential of expanding your existing home. Your contractor should also be up-to-date with the local codes and regulations. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Make a plan with contractors and architects</h3>
<p class="p1">Unlike smaller remodeling projects, building an addition is a complex, multi-layered project. It requires a team of qualified professionals who can help you.</p>
<p class="p1">A home addition is the total of a vast number of sub-projects. These projects range from design and planning to drywall work, flooring, painting, and more. Plus, these projects extend over weeks or months. There is one person who ties all of these strings together and makes it work: the general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1">Begin planning your project by hiring a licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/houston-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in Houston</a>. The spring and summer are good times to start since it gives you a headstart in the queue for renovations the following year.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Building Houston home additions: Outward or upward?</h3>
<p class="p1">Homeowners in Houston planning for home additions may raise a frequent question: Should you build outward or upward? It’s a difficult question for any area, as both have their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a ground-level addition outward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building outward means creating an addition that is at ground level. The addition is built adjacent to the existing house. At the end of the project, the wall between the two structures is opened up. Building a ground-level addition is less complex than adding to the top of a house. Plus, it is less invasive. Homeowners typically can live in the home while the addition is built.</p>
<p class="p1">Houston is largely a flat, one-story house city. Generally, the area has more single-story homes than double-story homes. Older, historic neighborhoods in Houston such as The Heights, Bellaire, or West U have generously-sized lots. In an era of shrinking lots, properties like this are rare opportunities for building outward.</p>
<p class="p1">Another upside: one-story homes are easier to cool down. Since heat rises, it collects in the second story. As a result, two-story homes are more expensive to cool.</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a second-story addition upward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building upward means adding a second story to the home. This type of renovation removes the roof and adds extra structural support. Then, the second story is built. With this highly invasive project, residents usually have to vacate the home for an extended period.</p>
<p class="p1">If your Houston property lot is not spacious, you may want to consider building upward. This preserves your yard for pets or children or for gardening.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Permits and approvals</h3>
<p class="p1">Permitted approvals by the City of Houston are required before and after building your addition. Building plans and fees must be submitted to the city before the building begins. Numerous corrections may be required. If approved, a building permit is issued.</p>
<p class="p1">However, this is not your final approval. In essence, a permit is just that: It permits you to build. Once the work is finished, the addition is inspected. If approved, a final approval is then issued.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s best to leave permits and approvals for large projects like home additions in the hands of contractors. These professionals know how to walk your project through the permitting process to minimize delays.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Houston home additions require a plan for extreme heat</h3>
<p>Heat and sun are part of living in the Gulf Coast region. Be sure to consider those inevitable high temperatures.</p>
<p>In the summer, the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. Planning your addition with heat in mind can be as simple as orientation. If possible, orient the addition so that it does not face in the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>Other passive cooling methods include planting large shade trees as part of the landscaping plan. Speak with your contractor about cool roof materials coated in glass fiber and aluminum.</p>
<p>Your current air conditioning unit might be able to handle the increased loads of the new addition. More often, it’s a good idea to install a separate A/C unit for the addition. Mini-split air-conditioning that doesn’t require ductwork is also popular.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home addition or home remodel, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> on Sweeten.

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49255 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen and dining area" width="1600" height="1068" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You love your home, and you love living in Atlanta. But there may be <em>some</em> parts of your home that you don&#8217;t love. Or maybe you just bought a new home, and you know you want to update it to suit you. We see renovation projects in Atlanta at a wide range of costs. Often, homeowners want to maximize their scope on a minimal budget. Luckily, there are a handful of tricks that can help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel smaller and smarter</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For years, one of the draws of living in Atlanta was that you could own a large house for the same—or less than—what you would pay in northern cities. Atlanta <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/10/3/17931250/lending-tree-report-atlanta-houston-biggest-houses-nation"><span class="s2">ranks number two</span></a> in the United States in home sizes. In fact, Atlanta’s average home size is just under 2,000 square feet. But sprawl has its price, which means large homes and large remodels come with higher costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Find ways to remodel that don’t involve creating a new foundation or building upward. If you can, stay within the existing footprint of the house. Explore rooms that are no longer used for their intended purpose and convert them. Tour the house with your contractor and find walls that you can open to expand two rooms into one large room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Look into Atlanta&#8217;s green remodeling incentives</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Green or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eco-friendly remodeling</a> helps the environment and can certainly help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many homeowners may not realize that they can take advantage of a host of <a href="https://www.nariatlanta.org/green-remodeling"><span class="s2">green remodeling incentives</span></a>. These incentives can reduce the cost of remodeling. Some of the incentives include tax credits, loan programs, tax exemptions, and rebates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speak to your contractor about your interest in green remodeling. You may also want to have an energy audit done before remodeling begins.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Tailor the HVAC to Atlanta&#8217;s weather</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heating and cooling are different in Atlanta than in other cities. Systems that work in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York aren’t always applicable in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a city with fewer than 50 days per year below freezing, Atlanta homes don&#8217;t need the kind of robust furnaces or heat pumps found in other areas of the country. And maxing out your A/C isn’t always the answer, either! Your A/C should be tailored specifically to Atlanta’s weather and to your own house. Also, it&#8217;s smart to explore passive cooling methods with your contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Make use of Georgia’s solar power and natural light</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is one of the sunniest cities in the United States, with at least 60% of the days per year being sunny. Use this to your advantage! Concentrate on improving windows on the south side of your house. Rooms that have plenty of large windows rely less on artificial light. This saves money on electricians’ costs and on the cost of extensive artificial lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the same time, make sure that these windows have low-e solar coating. Add draperies to block sun during the brightest part of the day.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel with mold in mind</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta can get humid—extremely humid. Humidity that reaches 55% or more can lead to mold growth. Poorly vented crawlspaces, basements, and rooms are susceptible to mold growth. Not all mold is dangerous. However, some mold can be a lung irritant and can affect those with respiratory ailments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Good remodeling work can be quickly undone by mold. To avoid mold growth, talk to your contractor about mold-inhibiting wall and ceiling systems, along with venting systems.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Refurbish, don’t replace</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The days of tearing out everything and replacing it wholesale are long gone. Now, there is a smarter approach to remodeling that incorporates fixing items, not throwing them out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, you may decide to reface, rather than replace, your kitchen cabinets. Refurbishing cabinets, tubs, showers, floors, walls, and more keep these items out of the landfill and make your Atlanta remodel more affordable. </span></p>
<p><em>Considering new doors for your kitchen cabinets? Get the lowdown on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different cabinet door styles.</a></em></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">DIY projects in an Atlanta remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not all of the work of your home remodel project needs to be done by the contractor’s workers. You can do a few things yourself in advance, or during downtimes. Sweat equity helps you save on remodel costs and make it all more affordable. Always coordinate in advance with your contractor if you plan to do DIY work. (Here’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/"><span class="s2">what you can DIY</span></a> and what should be left to the pros!)</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Use durable imitation materials</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You might really want that exotic hardwood flooring, but the price of it isn&#8217;t within your budget. Look for wood-look ceramic tile planks that look just like mahogany or other overseas hardwoods. Laminate and vinyl plank also look remarkably like real wood. Quartz and laminate countertops reliably imitate expensive marbles and granites. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wherever there is an expensive material, there is likely a far less expensive imitation material that you can use in your remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep the plumbing in place</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One rule of thumb for keeping bathroom and kitchen remodeling affordable: avoid moving the plumbing, if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whenever you move plumbing around, remodel costs rise. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you cannot change your shower, bathtub, or sink. You <i>can</i> replace or refurbish these items while keeping the core plumbing system where it is</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Shop around for the best contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finding the best contractor for a remodeling project in Atlanta isn&#8217;t about finding the cheapest person. Instead, it&#8217;s about finding a person who can best bring your vision to light. </span><span class="s1">Concentrate on finding a contractor who best matches your needs. You’ll also want to find a contractor who you work with well, and who you communicate well with. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Get on the general contractor’s schedule—now</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you sign with a contractor for a home remodeling project, the contractor places you on their calendar. Being in the early queue means getting ahead of other clients, especially when there is overall high demand for home remodeling, labor, and materials. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your expert for remodeling advice</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the upsides of hiring a general contractor is that you can take advantage of their knowledge and expertise. </span><span class="s1">Feel free to ask for their advice&#8230;that’s why you hired them! Contractors can have years or decades of experience in construction and the right one will help you match your scope to your budget.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider <em>all</em> of the materials (not just the tile itself!) plus labor to get a true picture of what it&#8217;ll cost to tile a bathroom</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49028" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg" alt="tiling costs" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TileCost-Cover-3-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When budgeting for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom tiling project</a>, it&#8217;s easy to become focused on the cost of the tile itself. After all, tile is at the heart of the project; it’s the main look of all of this. However, crucial (and often overlooked) steps like prep and time for labor can impact how much it&#8217;ll cost you to tile a bathroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this guide, Sweeten outlines three categories that go into the cost to tile a bathroom: <strong>prep</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, and <strong>labor</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Tiling prep work</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning the tile project, a number of items in the bathroom must be removed. After they have been removed, the subfloor must be assessed.</span></p>
<h4>Using ceramic tile in your bathroom?</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ceramic tile requires a stable base (substrate) that is rigid and does not bend. The bathroom’s existing subfloor should either be strong enough or it should be strengthened. For natural stone tile, the industry group <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">Ceramic Tile Education Foundation</span></a> (CTEF) recommends that the substrate be twice as rigid as for tiling with ceramics or porcelains. If the substrate is not smooth enough, it may require an additional layer of underlayment.</span></p>
<h4>Removing bathroom items</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Toilet: The toilet must always be removed before tiling a floor. The toilet will either be replaced, or a new toilet may be installed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Baseboards: Wall baseboards and any type of horizontal wall molding that touches the floor must be removed before tiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Door casing: Door casing—the vertical trim that forms a door frame—usually doesn&#8217;t need to be removed. Tile workers can cut the bottom of the casing and fit the tile underneath.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Shower/bathtub and bathroom cabinet: Showers, tubs, sink cabinets, and any permanent pieces do not need to be removed. However, sometimes they are removed during a full bathroom remodel.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Preparing (or repairing) the subfloor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When installing tile in a remodeled bathroom, it is common to find a damaged subfloor. This damage tends to be concentrated around the toilet, sink, and shower/bathtub. If you are removing the shower or bath, you may find even more damage under the shower pan or bathtub.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sometimes, large sections of the subfloor may need to be removed and replaced with a new subfloor. In some cases, the damage may extend to the floor joists (the beams below the subfloor). Both of these fixes are separate from the tiling.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are working with a general contractor, the contractor will remove all of the necessary items and make repairs. This prep work should be done ahead of time before the tile subcontractor begins.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While removing items is heavily a labor cost, some materials may figure in. This depends on the scale of the project. For example, large projects may require the rental of a dumpster. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Raw materials for prepping</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though tile is the most visible feature of bathroom tile, a support system of other materials makes a bathroom tile surface possible. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Subfloor prep materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Solid subfloor: Exterior-grade, tongue-and-groove plywood is a standard subfloor material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Underlayment on top of subfloor: Many tile pros recommend laying down an additional layer of thin cement board on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Leveling compound: Dips in the subfloor can be corrected with a liquid leveling compound. Poured directly onto the subfloor, this compound is self-leveling. It fills gaps up to 1-1/2-inch deep.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Tiling materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Thin-set: Thin-set is the mortar base that is applied under the tile.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout: Grout is the filler that is applied to the joints between the tiles.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout tint: Grout usually comes in a few variations of gray, black, cream, or white. But grout can also be tinted to nearly any color you desire.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Grout sealant: Grout is porous and must be sealed to prevent moisture infiltration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Haze remover: A light haze remains from the grouting process. A liquid haze remover is needed to clean this up.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Optional materials</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Uncoupling material: When installing tile on concrete, many tile professionals recommend that you use a special material to avoid cracking. An uncoupling material disconnects the tile from the concrete slab. This prevents concrete from transmitting cracks to the tile. <a href="https://www.ceramictilefoundation.org/homeowners-guide-to-hiring-qualified-tile-installer#chapter-3"><span class="s2">CTEF recommends</span></a> that all concrete floors with pre-existing cracks be installed with uncoupling material.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Radiant heating: To combat cold tile floors, many homeowners opt for radiant heating underneath the tile. This electrically operated mesh is embedded in the thin-set mortar. It is controlled by a wall thermostat.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Time and cost of labor</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many types of home projects are DIY-friendly. But tilework is a long-established, highly skilled craft that can be tricky for many DIYers to master. So, hiring pros to expertly lay the tile pays for itself many times over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the cost of tiling materials (thin-set, grout, etc.) is not broken out in an estimate, it may be included in the labor cost. If so, it will be noted as such.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One more factor that affects the cost of tile installation labor is the need for the tile contractor to return several times to the job site. After setting the tile, workers must allow at least 24 hours before returning for grouting. After grouting, workers must wait at least another 4 hours before returning to remove the grout haze. </span><span class="s1">All consults and the clean-up are usually included in the installation cost.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Choosing the style and color of your bathroom tile is an exciting remodeling step. But as you now know, there are many other factors that can impact the total cost to tile a bathroom. Knowing those factors will give you a leg up in understanding the bottom-line total cost when discussing the project with your contractor. </span></p>

<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Peninsula kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20126 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="peninsula kitchen layout with see-through kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalal + Frans&#8217; renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>

</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />

</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

<p>Phoenix is a favorite place to live because of the area’s favorable weather. Precipitation is low, the sun is strong, and temperatures are high. But sometimes, the temperatures run a bit too high for comfort.</p>
<p>Each year, on average, Phoenix’s temperature exceeds 100 degrees on 92 days. Knowing this, Sweeten wrote a homeowner&#8217;s guide on how to keep your house cool in those blazing months!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>Choose the best HVAC system</h3>
<p>Air-conditioning is a fact of life in Phoenix and the entire Valley of the Sun metro area. Passive cooling methods are crucial for maintaining a cooler home in Phoenix. But it is an inescapable fact that your home needs A/C. Choose the best possible A/C within your budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the SEER ratings. SEER is short for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. This rating is listed on a yellow sticker on every central air conditioning unit. Look for high SEER numbers of at least 13. Maximize your cooling efficiency with SEER ratings of 15 to 17.</li>
<li>Properly size your A/C unit. Units incapable of handling your home’s heat will become taxed. Plus, your home will never cool down enough. Units that are larger than needed are an unnecessary expense.</li>
<li>Central A/C units are popular. But they are no longer the only game in town. Ductless mini-split units, one per room, are less expensive. Also, they do not require ductwork.</li>
<li>Look at heat pumps. Despite their name, heat pumps cool homes just like air-conditioners. The difference is that they can be reversed to heat up the home.</li>
<li>Your general contractor can discuss with you the many factors that play into the choice. These factors: building materials, type and extent of insulation, and number of windows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install insulated ductwork</h3>
<p>You wouldn’t want a water pipe riddled with holes. You would barely get any water out of it. In the same sense, the HVAC ductwork in your attic is riddled with holes when it’s uninsulated.</p>
<p>Cool air expensively generated by your air conditioner can be lost in your attic. The cool air begins at the A/C. It runs through your hot attic in basic sheet metal ducts. The cool air warms up. By the time the air reaches the rooms, it is warmer than it should be.</p>
<p>There are many insulated ductwork options you can discuss with your contractor. Sheet metal ducts with fibrous glass insulation liner or wrap are a common choice. Or fibrous glass insulation boards can be added to ducts and plenums.</p>
<h3>Buy &#8220;cooler&#8221; lighting and appliances</h3>
<p>Lights can give off an enormous amount of heat. One halogen recessed light can raise the temperature of a 64-square-foot space by 15 degrees F in about one hour. Multiplied many times over, an array of these lights can warm up a house. Use cooler LED lights. Fluorescent lights can be used in laundry rooms or work areas.</p>
<p>Also, shop for efficient appliances. Refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers all produce heat. Purchase better-designed appliances that give off less heat.</p>
<h3>Choose a &#8220;cool&#8221; roof</h3>
<p>If you have ever tried to walk on a dark roof in the summer, you will know how hot they can get. A hot roof will transmit heat into the attic. Insulation in the attic will slow some of the heat, but some heat will still enter the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool roof&#8221; is a general term for any roof with qualities that keep heat out of your house. At a minimum, a cool roof can be a light-colored roof. But a white- or light-colored roof can still absorb up to 70-percent of solar radiation. Look instead for specially coated shingles that contain glass and aluminum particles. Even traditional terra cotta roof tiles are considered to be a cool roofing material.</p>
<p>Check out cool roof ratings from the non-profit <a href="https://coolroofs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cool Roof Rating Council</a> (CRRC). The basic ratings are similar to the familiar EnergyStar ratings for appliances.</p>
<h3>Install high vents or a whole-house fan</h3>
<p>Desert temperatures that soar during the day drop equally during the night. Phoenix’s night-time temperatures are often half that of daytime temperatures. Use this to your advantage with night-flushing.</p>
<p>Night-flushing means to open up your house as much as possible during the night to flush out built-up heat. Vents installed high up on the walls can help with this. Whole-house fans pull air through open windows and send it out through the roof. This also ventilates the attic. You don’t necessarily need to install new ductwork, either. Speak to a contractor about modifying existing HVAC ductwork for a whole-house fan.</p>
<h3>Landscaping for a cooler home</h3>
<p>The City of Phoenix has an ongoing effort to cool the city—and you can do it at home, too. <a href="https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/urban-forest/tree-and-shade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix’s Tree and Shade Master Plan</a> aims to shade at least 25-percent of the city. Speak to your contractor about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding large shade trees</a> like eucalyptus, elm, pine, ash, or pecan. Even trees with less foliage like olives, palms, and citrus can keep a home cooler.</p>
<h3>Paint the home in light colors</h3>
<p>There is a reason for all of those different shades of beige on homes around Phoenix: it’s cooler. Upwards of 90-percent of the sun’s radiant energy can be absorbed by dark paint colors. Conversely, lighter colors do an excellent job of repelling radiant energy.</p>
<p>If beige isn’t your thing, you’ll find a wide range of other light colors that block the heat. Light-gray, cream, blue, ivory, and of course, white, are perfect for holding back the heat.</p>
<p>Take these steps to help keep your house cool while being more efficient for the planet and your wallet. Happy (green) renovating!</p>

<p>Many homeowners who want modern, well-built kitchen cabinets eventually end up at IKEA. For starters, IKEA&#8217;s cabinets are reasonably priced, well-designed, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/ikea-kitchen-cabinets-everything-renovators-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last for a long time</a>. However, IKEA is not the only place to buy cabinets. Here, Sweeten compares how Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Cabinets To Go offer services and cabinets similar to IKEA’s—sometimes with competing prices.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>IKEA vs. Home Depot and Lowe’s stores</h3>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s are large, general-category home improvement stores offering a wide range of home goods. Though they are different companies, they are similar in many ways, especially for kitchen cabinets.</p>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s are well-represented in the U.S., each with about 2,000 stores and locations in every state. The number of stores is beneficial: most shoppers can reach a Home Depot or a Lowe’s within an hour or less. By contrast, IKEA has around 50 U.S. stores, which are clustered in large metro areas— and some areas have no IKEA store at all! Unless you are purely shopping for online kitchen cabinets (known as RTA or ready-to-assemble), it is important to visit a store to view cabinet samples in person.</p>
<p>Most Home Depot and Lowe’s stores have a kitchen design center or a desk that is open during daytime hours. This expert can help a shopper plan for and purchase kitchen cabinets. One drawback: because the desks are typically located in the center of the store, it can be loud and hard to focus. It’s much the same way at an IKEA store. For all of these stores, it’s best to visit during the evenings and weekdays for more personal attention.</p>
<h3>What stores have in-stock cabinet options?</h3>
<h4>IKEA&#8217;s stocked warehouses</h4>
<p>IKEA stores are huge. One reason they are so big is that they have attached warehouses. These warehouses carry nearly all of the kitchen cabinets in stock. In fact, when you buy IKEA cabinets, you can take them home immediately, as long as you have a means of transport (IKEA also has a delivery service).</p>
<p>Because IKEA stores are so large, more space can be devoted to the kitchen section. This means that you will find a large number of full-scale kitchen displays at IKEA. You can test-drive the cabinets by opening doors and drawers. Home Depot and Lowe’s stores may have as many as four or five full-scale kitchen displays, but often less.</p>
<p>Because IKEA aims to keep kitchen cabinets in stock, it cannot carry a large selection. IKEA has 24 different kitchen cabinet styles. These 24 cabinet styles revolve around a single-core cabinet system: SEKTION. Any one of those 24 cabinet styles can be applied to the SEKTION component system. Most cabinet styles lean towards solid colors such as white, gray, green, beige, or black. IKEA also has wood-effect melamine veneer cabinets and a few natural wood veneer cabinets.</p>
<h4>A wider selection of styles</h4>
<p>If you need cabinets now, Home Depot and Lowe’s both have a number of in-stock cabinets on the shelves. For Home Depot, this means its house brand, Hampton Bay. For Lowe’s, it’s the Project Source and Diamond NOW brands. The selection of in-stock cabinets at both stores is far less than those found in IKEA’s large warehouses.</p>
<p>Home Depot and Lowe’s offer a far wider selection of cabinet styles than IKEA. The types of styles include those found at IKEA, plus many more. Home Depot and Lowe’s, too, have full-wood ½ inch plywood cabinets available for special order. They also carry fiberboard box cabinets that are similar to IKEA’s.</p>
<p>Delivery time at Home Depot and Lowe’s for its stock cabinets is around 7 to 10 days. Estimated lead times for semi-custom cabinets is 14 to 30 days. IKEA’s delivery times are shorter: 4 to 13 days.</p>
<h3>IKEA vs. Cabinets To Go</h3>
<p>Cabinets To Go is a home design center with 75 locations throughout the U.S.; mostly around the East Coast and in the South.</p>
<p>Shopping for cabinets at Cabinets To Go is completely different from shopping at IKEA, Home Depot, or Lowe’s. A Cabinets To Go store is services-oriented and carries no stock. The purpose of Cabinets To Go stores is to bring homeowners together with design experts. In contrast, IKEA, Home Depot, and Lowe’s are goods-oriented stores that also offer a kitchen services component.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go is focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/full-wall-kitchen-cabinets-an-expanding-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and bathroom cabinets</a>, plus supporting items such as counters, sinks, and flooring. While IKEA also is home-centric, it includes many other types of house goods. The focus at Home Depot and Lowe’s is even broader, carrying everything from cabinets to lumber, housewares, carpet, and paint.</p>
<h4>If you want a personal shopping experience</h4>
<p>Compared to IKEA’s large stores, Cabinets To Go stores are much smaller. There is some walk-in traffic at Cabinets To Go, but most shoppers visit during scheduled appointments. Because of this, the stores can feel more personal and relaxed.</p>
<p>Despite their size, Cabinets To Go stores usually have a fair number of mock full or partial kitchens. Appointments with a kitchen expert may include looking at those mock-ups. You&#8217;ll use most of the appointment time to go through sample doors and drawer fronts. During your visit, the expert will also work up a 3D plan.</p>
<h4>Styles of cabinets and box construction</h4>
<p>Cabinets To Go’s 18 custom stock cabinets styles mostly differ from IKEA’s slab or bevel-front cabinets. Cabinets To Go does have a number of modern-style cabinets. But most styles are Shaker-style or raised-panel, for a more classic look. For even more choices, Cabinets To Go’s custom cabinet line provides over 160 door styles and more than 60 paints and stains.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go’s box construction, too, is different. IKEA’s cabinet boxes are fiberboard overlaid in melamine foil. Cabinet to Go’s box frames are solid birch with a ¾-inch birch center, with sides covered in wood veneer.</p>
<p>Cabinets To Go&#8217;s cabinets are shipped to your local store for you to pick up for free. Or the cabinets may be shipped directly to your home at extra cost. For any cabinet brand, delivery leads are two to three weeks, an estimate that varies according to cabinet selection and the store.</p>
<h3>Stock and pre-fabricated cabinets: IKEA, Home Depot, Lowe&#8217;s, and Cabinets To Go</h3>
<p>Widely available across the country, these large retailers are price-smart go-to&#8217;s for kitchen renovators. Plus, in these affordable price categories, your budget may even go further! <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best vetted contractors</a></span>.</span></p>

<h3>Popular questions asked</h3>
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to redo kitchen cabinets</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are a few ways to refresh kitchen cabinets, depending on how much time, money, and effort you want to put in. Swapping out knobs/drawer pulls is the lowest-cost, lowest-effort way to refresh cabinets. Painting cabinets with a bold jewel tone or matte shade is another common refresh tactic. More involved methods involve swapping out cabinet doors, using a custom-fronts provider like <a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/">Semihandmade</a>, or doing a complete rip-and-replace to fully replace your cabinet boxes and doors.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064501783">
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How much do new kitchen cabinets cost?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Stock kitchen cabinets, commonly found in stores like Home Depot and IKEA, are the cheapest option, at roughly $60/ linear foot. Semi-custom cabinets, coming in a greater range of sizes and styles, cost roughly $90/ linear foot and up. Custom cabinets, the most expensive, cost $200 – $500/ linear foot, and are carried by brands like Poggenpohl, Bilotta, and Henrybuilt.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064515601">
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>Should I buy kitchen cabinets from Home Depot?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are benefits to buying kitchen cabinets from Home Depot. Firstly, Home Depot stores are plentiful, with about 2,000 stores and locations in every state. Most Home Depot stores have a kitchen design center available during daytime hours. This resource can help shoppers plan for and purchase kitchen cabinets. If you need cabinets immediately, Home Depot offers a number of in-stock cabinets in their stores.</p>

			<h2>What to know about bathroom remodeling in Washington DC from costs and permits to ventilation</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg" alt="Washington DC bathroom" width="1000" height="714" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-600x428.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/white-bathroom-Washington-DC-72dpi-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Washington DC has limitless possibilities that make it one of the most exciting places to live in the U.S. If you are considering bathroom remodeling in Washington DC, you may find a parallel set of challenges and possibilities for your project. Not to worry: here we outline what to know before you renovate a bathroom in the DC area.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s2">Defining the area around Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC first means hammering down its geography. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">The commonly held notion is that DC consists of the District, Southern Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Sweeten currently services </span><span class="s3">the DC area, Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland, and select counties in Virginia, including Fairfax and Arlington.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Exterior architecture</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Part of what makes the DC area so appealing is its architecturally significant buildings. Many older and noteworthy buildings are within the District, specifically Georgetown, Capitol Hill, Adams Morgan, and Dupont. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Southern Maryland and Northern Virginia do have some historically important buildings, </span><span class="s4">but not to the extent that the District does.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s2">In the District, Preservation Reviews by the Office of Planning tend to concentrate on exterior work. Interior alterations and non-structural interior demolition are both permitted activities but are exempt from Preservation Reviews.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Renovation bathroom costs in Washington DC</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The cost of remodeling a high-end bathroom in the South Atlantic region, which includes the DC metro area, is higher than the national average. Starting costs for a low-end bathroom remodel is $16,500. A mid-range budget starts at around $26,000. A high-end remodel starts at $38,000 for a 4– or 5–piece bath. (You can read more in Sweeten’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-washington-dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom remodeling cost guide for Washington DC</a>). Contractors will be able to provide you with more detailed estimates after a site visit. It&#8217;s also important to meet with licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/washington-dc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Washington DC</a> with local experience who are up-to-date on codes and regulations. </span></p>
<h4>&#8220;Rip-and-replace&#8221; bathroom remodels in older homes</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">A “rip-and-replace” bathroom remodel will always save you money over a full remodel. Like the name says, fixtures are pulled out and replaced. The footprint does not change, nor does the drywall, subfloor, pipes, or wiring. In a “rip-and-replace,” the most expensive items are the toilet, tub or shower, faucet, sink, and cabinet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">But there is a catch: Washington <span class="s2">DC</span> has a significantly older housing stock. East of the Capitol, north of the K Street business district, up Georgia Avenue, and on either side of the 16th Street corridor, houses can be 100 years old or more. This means that a “rip-and-replace” remodel is usually not possible if the bathroom is in its original state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Bathroom remodels for these older homes usually require a full gutting to expose the insides of the walls, including pipes and wiring. Knob-and-tube wiring, common in these homes, must be replaced with modern non-metallic wiring. Additionally, the service panel should be updated. When the studs are bowed or broken, they can be sistered with a parallel stud to the side. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5">Many of these older <span class="s2">DC</span> homes were solidly built with materials considered premium for their time. Common materials that <span class="s2">DC</span> homeowners will encounter are cast iron tubs, two-by-fours that actually measure 2 inches by 4 inches, heavy joists, and linoleum. These items can be difficult to remove. For example, homeowners removing cast-iron tubs will need to break or cut them apart on-site to assist with removal.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">The effect of climate in DC </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The DC area can get hot—<em>really</em> hot. While DC&#8217;s spring weather is pleasant, the summer climate turns quickly—with record temperatures over 100 F and averages in the 80s. DC’s high humidity keeps everything wet, especially moisture-prone bathrooms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Explore with a general contractor the full range of measures to keep condensation in the bathroom at bay:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Adequate bathroom exhaust fan<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Openable window, if possible<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Dehumidifier<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Heated flooring<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Wall heater<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Mold-resistant paint<br />
</span></li>
<li>Install a moisture-resistant ceiling</li>
<li>Use moisture-resistant materials such as waterproof drywall or ceramic tiles</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Permits for Washington DC remodels</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Bathroom remodeling permits are required in the District, Montgomery County, and Fairfax County.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">District: An Alteration and Repair Permit from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) is required. You must submit architectural plans. Since your bathroom remodel will likely be under the Department’s 1,000-square-foot cut-off, you can have your bathroom remodel project fast-tracked with a counter review.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Montgomery County: The Department of Permitting Services will require a Residental Alteration permit. You may need additional electrical and mechanical permits, too.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Fairfax County: Land Development Services requires a permit for interior alterations, as well as for individual projects related to bathroom remodeling such as installing new plumbing fixtures.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Building approvals</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC proper generally will be more involved than in the suburbs due to the larger number of condos and other board-controlled buildings. Within DC, this will be less of an issue as you move northward to Tenleytown, Petworth, Chevy Chase, and Takoma since more single-family residences are located there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Even though you own everything within the walls of the condo, condo boards typically require that you submit alteration plans for approval or attend meetings to discuss your proposal. Bathroom remodels are of special interest since these projects touch on critical services such as electrical and plumbing that affect other units. Logistics like parking for workers, elevator usage, and demolition removal must be considered.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Condo boards each have their own personalities and requirements. Board approval can be tricky. But if you are working with an experienced general contractor for the bathroom remodel, they will help you navigate the approval process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p8"><span class="s2">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC? Now is the time.</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Don&#8217;t let the possible challenges of remodeling a DC bathroom stop you. There are clear benefits of remodeling to consider; like creative exploration, personal enjoyment, and higher resale value. </span></p>

They hold the countertop and the sink. </span><span class="s1">IKEA base cabinets are 30 inches high and 24.75 inches deep. After adding legs and a countertop, they reach 36 inches, which is the standard countertop height for U.S. Kitchens.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A complete IKEA base cabinet consists of the cabinet box, drawers and drawer fronts, and inner drawers and fronts. Drawer organizers are optional.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Wall cabinets</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wall cabinets are mounted on the wall and are attached to the studs. They hold plates and food items. </span><span class="s1">Wall cabinets are usually mounted 20 inches above the base cabinets. Most IKEA wall cabinets are 15 inches deep with a few measuring 24 inches deep. These wall cabinets are typically mounted over refrigerators.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A complete IKEA wall cabinet consists of the cabinet box, doors, hinges, and shelves. Shelf inserts are optional.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="colorful kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50274 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Jena&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-90-square-foot-manhattan-kitchen-revives-in-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovation</a> with IKEA wall cabinets</p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">High cabinets</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">High cabinets are mounted on the floor. They are intended for pantry items or small appliances. </span><span class="s1">They are narrow—15 to 30 inches wide, with 24 inches being most common. High cabinets are either 80 inches or 90 inches tall. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A complete IKEA high cabinet consists of the cabinet, fronts, and shelves. Doors and drawers are often included.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Drawers, shelves, and dividers</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">MAXIMERA and FORVARA soft-closing drawers and dividers come with the cabinets.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">UTRUSTA shelves made either of fiberboard or glass. Shelves are included. The UTRUSTA line comes with pegs that fit into the sides of SEKTION cabinets to hold up the shelves.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/123838_Allison_KitchBath_02_CROP.jpg" alt="Open plan galley white and sage green kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56763" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/123838_Allison_KitchBath_02_CROP.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/123838_Allison_KitchBath_02_CROP-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/123838_Allison_KitchBath_02_CROP-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Allison and Tim&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/sage-green-kitchen-remodel-in-kips-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-toned kitchen</a></span></p><h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">What are IKEA wall cabinets made of?</span></h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA cabinet boxes are made of fiberboard and melamine foil. Cabinet doors and drawer fronts are made of fiberboard. They are covered in melamine foil, paint, wood, or glass.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA cabinet boxes</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fiberboard (or MDF, for medium-density fiberboard) is an engineered wood made from wood chips and resins. Wood chips are pressed together with heat and high pressure to form boards.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA cabinet and drawer fronts</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, more than 15 cabinet and drawer front styles are offered. The cabinet front profile options include slab, beveled, beadboard, and Shaker. </span></p><p><span class="s1">IKEA has one natural wood veneer cabinet front: the TORHAMN fronts are covered in real ash wood veneer.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most fronts are either a solid color, simulated wood, or real wood grain. Except for white, the solid colors veer toward darker or earthen tones: gray, brown, black, or green. The style and texture of the fronts affect the price. </span></p><ul></ul><h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Quality: Are IKEA cabinets good?</span></h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Swedish products are well-designed and built to be precise and long-lasting. All fasteners that hold the cabinets together are internal and invisible. Euro-style hinges on the doors are soft-closing and hidden. The drawers are also silently self-closing. Through efficient mass production and by using engineered wood materials that cost much less than solid natural wood, prices are affordable. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">SEKTION kitchen cabinets have a 25-year limited warranty. This warranty covers all components of a SEKTION cabinet system. The policy warrants against defects in materials and workmanship. However, any defective part of the SEKTION system will be repaired or replaced.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take note: IKEA states that its natural wood and light lacquered (painted) surfaces may yellow with age. As a result, exposure to light will contribute to this aging.</span></p><h4>Maintenance tips</h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One key to maintaining the IKEA SEKTION system is regular maintenance. Specifically, you&#8217;ll need to protect your SEKTION cabinets from excessive humidity. Fiberboard can swell when it absorbs moisture. You should avoid letting coffee makers or dishwashers steam under or against SEKTION cabinets. Also, quickly wiping up any spills is a great way to ensure cabinet quality. </span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40344 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Open concept living room and kitchen with white IKEA kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sally and Ross&#8217;</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten kitchen renovation</a></p><h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen cabinet installation</span></h3><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">DIY</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, IKEA cabinets are easy to install. The cabinets come flat-packed in cardboard boxes. Then, homeowners can either pick up the boxes at the store or arrange for at-home delivery. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The installation comes with a clear, picture-oriented instructions guide. To complete installation, you&#8217;ll need simple tools, like a hammer and power drill/driver. The process to install IKEA wall cabinets is streamlined, but it is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/the-cons-of-diy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still a large-scale project</a>. You&#8217;ll also need to set time aside—often, many hours—for assembly. For example, even just unboxing the cabinets and disposing of the cardboard will add to your time commitment.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Professional installation</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some IKEA stores offer professional installation services to assemble and install the cabinets, doors, drawers, fittings, and handles. When you&#8217;re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with a Sweeten contractor</a> who can also assemble and install them for you.</span></p><h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much do IKEA kitchen cabinets cost?</span></h3><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Individual cabinet costs</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA base cabinets generally cost between $200 and $1,100. Wall cabinets cost between $200 and $750. High cabinets cost between $200 and $1,300.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Full IKEA kitchen cabinet costs</span></h4><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The design industry uses a 10’ x 10’ kitchen as a standard for measuring cabinet costs. This hypothetical kitchen includes cabinets, door and drawer fronts, drawers, shelves, hinges, cover panels, toe-kicks, and legs. The cost does not include countertops, handles, sinks, lighting, or appliances.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA kitchen cabinets <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fit most kitchen remodeling budgets</a>. For example, a full 10’ x 10’ kitchen ranges from about $1,600 to about $3,500. The average cost is about $2,500. This cost does not include taxes, delivery, or installation. So w</span>hether your kitchen is showing its age or the style just isn&#8217;t your taste, IKEA cabinets can help stretch your budget.</p><p><!-- /wp:yoast/faq-block --></p>					</div>

<p>A gut renovation involves layers of costs, design, timing, and permits. This kind of renovation may at first seem mysterious and full of uncertainties. Ultimately, having the right contractor who knows how to handle any unexpected gut renovation challenges is key to a successful remodel. Below, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines hidden gut renovation challenges during a remodel to help you prep in advance.</p>
<p><em>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</em></p>
<h3>Plan for hidden problems under floors and walls</h3>
<p>Gutting and renovating a house often reveals unpleasantries, like black mold, termite activity, rotting studs, and joists or foundation issues. The best way to handle these is through discovery and repair, which will prevent problems from worsening as time goes on. Perform this due diligence with your contractor so they can provide a more accurate cost estimate and work schedule.</p>
<h3>Clearly communicate about timing &amp; scheduling</h3>
<p>Surprise: homeowners and contractors are often on the same page with timing and scheduling. It may be surprising to hear that most contractors want to move your project along at a brisk yet efficient pace! Along with subcontractors and tradesmen, your project is likely one of many projects they are working on.</p>
<p>Having healthy communication with your contractor will keep the project moving along.  Homeowners should feel comfortable asking practical questions and raising various issues. Also, provide timely responses to a contractor’s questions by text, phone, or email. This is vital since no <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legitimate contractor will undertake tasks</a> that you have not ordered and signed off on. (Also, it will help your gut renovation stay on pace!)</p>
<p>Before starting any work, you and the contractor will develop a timeline for the project. While building and renovation schedules always have some built-in flexibility, the goal should be to stick to that schedule as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Costs for a gut renovation: Controlling the budget</h3>
<p>You want your home’s gut renovation to cost <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as close to the estimate as possible</a>. Once a contract has been accepted and signed, most contractors also want to bring the project in at cost (or close to it).</p>
<p>Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way. Add in an additional 10 to 15 percent above the expected budget for a non-gut remodel, and add more than 15% for a gut remodel.</p>
<p>All of these &#8220;extra cost&#8221; issues are addressed in an orderly way via the change order: regular adjustments to the original contract that accommodate extra work, and which are signed by both you and the contractor.</p>
<h3>Gutting a house? Architects &amp; designers need extra time.</h3>
<p>If you plan on working with an architect or designer, be sure there is sufficient lead time for your design team to do their work. The bulk of the design team&#8217;s work comes before any physical remodel work happens. A solid design plan must come before the first piece of drywall or plaster is removed from the home.</p>
<h3>Handle hazardous materials safely</h3>
<p>Fortunately, consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of home renovation waste. This is good, as hazardous materials found during the project must be properly dealt with! These materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walls painted with lead-based paint</li>
<li>Asbestos insulation packed around pipes, in tile mastic, or in loose-fill insulation</li>
<li>Black mold, which can impact respiratory functions</li>
</ul>
<p>No hazardous waste case is totally unsolvable. However, you&#8217;ll need qualified subcontractors to help, and they must be added to the overall plan for cost and timing. Sometimes, a hazardous material can stay in place if left undisturbed, or if it is contained.</p>
<h3>Permits, codes, &amp; approvals for gutting and renovating a house</h3>
<p>Nearly every gut home renovation needs some type of permit or approval by a legal entity.</p>
<p>If you live in a condo, alterations may need to be approved by the board. For owners of houses controlled by a housing association (HOA), interior improvements typically do not need to be approved by the HOA (but exterior improvements do!)</p>
<p>Owners of condos and single-family detached houses under an HOA must seek approval and permits from their local permit agency. It covers a wide range of activities for a gut renovation.</p>
<p>Removing a load-bearing wall, electrical and plumbing work, and major HVAC work are examples of sub-projects that likely will require a permit. Owners of properties in dense metro areas usually need to secure permits for trash dumpsters parked on the street.</p>
<p>Contractors perform a valuable service when it comes time to arrange, or pull, the permits. The contractor or representative will manage this whole process. This includes making visits to the permit office and meeting with inspectors at the building site.</p>
<h3>Neighbors and the neighborhood</h3>
<p>Simpler updates like window replacements, flooring installation, or interior painting are often unnoticed by neighbors. But gut home renovations, especially those involving the entire house, can draw attention. A trash dumpster on the street or multiple tradesmen vans parked by your home hint to others that major work is happening.</p>
<p>Neighbor <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/good-neighbors-heads-renovation-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relations are best handled by </a>the homeowner before the project begins. Take the time to inform your neighbors of the upcoming work. Speak to your contractor about how they handle noise ordinances or illegal parking.</p>
<p>Hopefully, being aware of the type of bumps you may encounter during a gut renovation will be helpful in smoothing the path forward. The right contractor will be a partner in guiding you during this renovation process.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="red-ladder-white-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47775 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2.jpg" alt="red ladder and white walls in a room under renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cons-of-DIY-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Fueled by enough YouTube videos, a homeowner can feel emboldened to take on anything—even a DIY renovation.</p>
<p>It’s natural to be undecided about whether you want to do that full home renovation by yourself or hire professionals. Doing it yourself can mean acting as your own project manager, or it can mean doing it all by hand (completely or partially.) In any case, the prospect of cost savings is what tempts most renovators.</p>
<p>However, there is a counter-argument—the cons of DIY. Is that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIY full home renovation</a> really in your best interests? Examining the cons of DIY isn’t a scare story or a money pit narrative. Instead, it’s a window onto the scale and complexity of DIY house renovation. Below, Sweeten outlines how to make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Completion time</h3>
<p>Home renovations require time and attention to make both small and key decisions. Depending on the scope, part of your home may be covered in plastic protection, or kitchens and bathrooms will be unusable. What you want is a full home renovation that operates on a compact, predictable schedule.</p>
<p>You have a life. Career, kids, relationships, friends, leisure: All of these have priority. This narrows down the amount of time that you have available to work on your house.</p>
<p>Professionals compress the schedule and complete the project much faster than if you had done it by yourself. Both parties should discuss the schedule and duration so everyone has a clear understanding and realistic expectations. Plus, they have a vested interest in finishing in an efficient manner since yours is likely one of many projects they&#8217;re completing.</p>
<h3>Keeping on schedule</h3>
<p>When you install your own laminate floor or paint your own bathroom, timing is easy. You have three or four minor milestones to hit, and it’s simple to keep them in order.</p>
<p>But when the project is as multi-layered as a full home renovation, it’s like playing multi-dimensional chess. Each project—floor, walls, windows, plumbing, and more—has its own set of milestones. Each of those projects is a milestone and must weave in with other projects. And, to make it even more interesting, you sometimes need to bounce back and forth between projects. Coordinating subcontractors within that system can get bewildering.</p>
<p>By contrast, contractors know how to keep scheduling straight; it’s their stock in trade. They’ll keep all of the projects running as consistently as possible. And they’ll seamlessly coordinate the movements of the subcontractors.</p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Quality of work</h3>
<p>Unless you have tiled a shower before, you first need to learn how to tile a shower. The worst classroom for learning how to tile is in your own house. You do not want your house to be a test subject for your beginner tiling, wiring, flooring, or plumbing skills.</p>
<p>Professionals do this work all the time. With training, apprenticeships, and experience in the field, they have already worked out the kinks. Professionals generally turn out professional quality work.</p>
<h3>Codes and permits</h3>
<p>A vast amount of home renovation work touches on building codes and permits. Structural work, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and even water heaters require permits in most municipalities. All permit work must be done according to code. And just because you aren’t required to pull a permit for a certain project doesn’t mean that building code isn’t applicable.</p>
<p>Code-compliant work may suffer at the hands of DIYers. The pros know code and are professionally bound to turn out work that complies with the latest codes. Contractors, subcontractors, designers, and architects stay abreast of the latest changes in their field.</p>
<h3>Cons of DIY: Finding subcontractors</h3>
<p>Subcontractors are skilled tradespeople who do projects like plumbing, electrical, drywall, painting, or flooring.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve decided to DIY your home renovation by hand, you still might end up hiring pros for some projects like whole-house wiring, solid wood or engineered wood floor installation, drywall installation, tiling a shower, or blowing or rolling insulation into an attic.</p>
<p>Finding and lining up good subcontractors can be a challenge. Using a contractor can take that chore off of your plate since the contractor has ready access to a pool of trusted subs.</p>
<h3>Renovating safely</h3>
<p>Homeowners taking on full DIY home renovations risk injury in many ways. Old paint might be lead-based, or those floor tiles might have asbestos. Black mold is common in ceilings, attics, and walls. Falls—the most common type of household injury—can occur even when you are on a ladder painting crown molding.</p>
<p>When you hire professionals to do the job, they have the know-how, safety gear, and materials to keep themselves and you safe. Safety is second nature to them since their livelihood and health depend on it.</p>
<h3>Do DIY renovations really save money?</h3>
<p>One reason often mentioned for doing a DIY full home renovation is that it saves money. As long as you can keep the renovation moving and on-target, with no wasted time or materials, you just might save some money.</p>
<p>But there is also the distinct possibility that you may lose this bet. If your project isn’t clearing inspections, you need to do it over until you get it right. That costs money. If you decide to do a hands-on renovation, you may need to purchase tools that are used only once: a wet tile saw, a full set of drywall tools, a paint sprayer.</p>
<p>When you hire a professional to do your full home renovation, you might save money in a number of ways. Savings might come in the form of wholesale discounts, bulk discounts, or special perks granted by a supplier since the professional is a regular buyer. Or from years of experience, the professional may have a keen eye for finding materials that are still high-quality but less expensive.</p>
<h3>Is a DIY renovation the right choice?</h3>
<p>No solution applies to everyone in all situations. A DIY home renovation might be perfect if you are hungry to learn new skills. For anyone who is interested in the process as well as the product, DIY renovation is an eye-opener. Finally, if you are short on money but long on time, a DIY renovation might be right for you.</p>
<p>Hiring professionals to do your whole-house renovation helps you hit those critical timing marks that keep you on schedule. The work will be done to professional quality, safely and cleanly, in accordance with local building codes. Peace of mind and the assurance that the job will be done right—and not hanging over your head for months—are just a few of the benefits of using pros to do your full house renovation.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-brown-vinyl-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33688" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg" alt="white living room with brown vinyl floor and a white barn door after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your house needs a few improvements and you have the urge to do them all immediately. Every project seems to announce itself with equal priority. Unless you’re awash in money and time, you cannot address all at once. You need to sift through your priorities—starting with knowing where to splurge vs. save during a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Below, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> helps you understand where to splurge vs. save so you can define your priorities.</span></p>
<h3>What does splurging mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Splurging doesn’t mean overspending. It can mean shifting money from one project to another. Or placing one project higher on the to-do list than other projects. Splurge on things that you touch or see often. Splurge on things that are meaningful to you or which make you happy. </span></p>
<h3>What does saving mean?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Saving doesn’t mean to skip or ignore. It means that you can safely put it on the back burner for now. Or if you want to do it, you can dial down on the cost a bit. Many times, after the project has been on the back burner long enough, you might see it in a clearer light.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you think in terms of splurge vs. save during a renovation, all of these home projects fall into an order that makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Kitchens</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Splurge: Kitchen Countertops</span></strong></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Every day, you touch, see, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use your kitchen countertops</a>. Whether you choose quartz, solid surface, natural stone, laminate, or wood, your countertop choice is semi-permanent. After the design, fabrication, and installation, changing out your countertop shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. If you want a certain type of quartz countertop, but choose a shade or pattern that you don’t feel strongly about, ask yourself: How will I feel about this in a year? </span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Kitchen Appliances</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen appliances are better designed than ever. The rising tide of improved kitchen technology lifts all boats—even for lower-priced appliances. With research, you can find lower-cost refrigerators, dishwashers, cooktops, and ranges that fit your needs. These appliances often match or exceed the quality of higher-priced versions from only a few years ago. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bathrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bathroom Fixtures</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bathroom fixtures are more than just mechanical devices. They aren&#8217;t just knobs and levers that start and stop the water. Fixtures are ornaments that complement a beautiful shower, tub, or sink. Spend more to splurge vs. save for bathroom fixtures that make you happy.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Bathroom Technology</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Technology has entered all parts of our lives, so why not the bathroom, too? IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a concept that describes how common things within our life are now Internet-equipped. Bathroom technology and IoT are not gimmicks! IoT devices can track water usage, regulate heating, and allow the bathroom to better adapt to your needs. Bathroom technology has its place, and it is the future. But for now, you can limit your bathroom smart devices or put them on the back burner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Living rooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Paint</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That designer paint that you’ve been eyeing? Now it can be yours. You can easily justify spending more on the premium paint that you want in the living room. That’s because the living room gets so much facetime, and it’s so public. Poor quality paint may flake, chip, or fade over time, costing more in the end. When you decide to splurge instead of save on your desired paint, you’ll be happier in the long run.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Lighting</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living room lighting, while necessary, does not need to be expensive. Prioritize the shape and the finish of the lighting fixture over the brand name. One trick of designers is to over-scale lighting fixtures for a dramatic look. Just make sure that all of the in-wall wiring for sconces and ceiling lights is complete first!</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Bedrooms</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Bedroom Closet systems</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An unfinished closet is an empty box waiting for your stuff. However, that stuff has no place to go unless you create a system. Gone are the days of the closet rod with one shelf above it. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Closet storage systems</a> belong in all closets now. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Reach-in closets benefit from a shoe fence or shoe cubby, two or three drawers, and plenty of open shelving, plus a closet rod. Walk-in closets should be outfitted with the same and more: additional shelves and drawers, pull-out baskets, multiple hanging areas, and lighting.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Millwork and trim</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom millwork and trim are the finishing touches for homes. If yours is a home of architectural significance, custom trim throughout is practically required. But if you want to save money, you can ease back on the fancy millwork in the private areas of the home. Save the ceiling medallions, crown molding, chair rails, dentils, batten, and picture rails for the dining and living areas.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: </span><span class="s1">Basements</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Basement Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moisture is usually the deciding factor when you consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether or not to finish your basement</a>. Prevalent moisture can turn an expensive basement remodel into an uninhabitable area best used for storage. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An attractive, moisture-shedding floor covering and a subfloor system can make a world of difference. Begin with the subfloor system, interlocking 24-inch squares that elevate your floor covering about 1-inch. Then, choose a basement-ready floor covering that you love, whether ceramic or porcelain tile, luxury vinyl planks, engineered wood flooring, or laminate flooring.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Guest bedrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building out a guest bedroom in your basement is a wise move when you know that it will get frequent use, either by friends and family or as a rental unit. But if you want a guest bedroom in your basement only for the occasional visitor, you’re taking up valuable space best used for other activities.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs. Save: Attics</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Built-in storage</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-in storage doesn’t often rank high in priority in other parts of the house, but this is not the case for attics. Attics are starved for space to begin with. Once you add furniture, you have even less storage room. Knee walls are the short walls that extend from the floor to the rafters. Knee walls that have built-in storage should be built during the remodeling process, not later.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Full bathrooms</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Full bathrooms—toilet, sink, and shower or shower/tub—are a rarity in attics unless the intent is to build out an entire suite with living quarters. Otherwise, attics used as offices or children’s play areas work well with just a half-bathroom.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Splurge vs Save: Decks</span></h3>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Splurge: Deck Flooring</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your choice of deck flooring can easily make or break how much you end up using—and loving or avoiding—your deck. With that in mind, you’ll want to prioritize decking.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the best in looks and maximum strength, choose a premium wood such as ipe or mahogany. Both are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and they return maximum resale value. Composite wood—a mixture of wood fibers and plastics—is smooth, splinter-free underfoot, and looks remarkably like wood.</span></p>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Save: Deck Built-ins</b></span></h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Built-ins such as benches, tables, and planters are wonderful additions to decks. Built-in benches are especially valuable because they tuck away to the side, opening up more space in the center of the deck. Yet one way to pare down your deck-building budget is to save the built-ins for a later day. The same builder (or a different one) can always come back and create those built-ins that your heart desires.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Splurge vs. Save in a Renovation: Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Almost every room in a home would gladly use a piece of the budget. Knowing what projects can wait until a later date, or what may or may not maximize the full breadth of the room, can help guide on where to splurge vs. save in your renovation.</span></p>

<h3>Prepping the bathroom&#8217;s surface</h3>
<p>To measure for bathroom tile on floors or the walls, it would seem that everything is clear-cut, with nothing left open for interpretation. However, there are various factors to consider so that you purchase the correct quantity of tile.</p>
<p>In this guide, Sweeten outlines how to measure the space for accuracy. You&#8217;ll also calculate for enough extra to make the installation smoother.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p>When measuring bathroom dimensions and matching numbers to a physical product—tile—questions will come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overage is required, but how much?</li>
<li>Should you tile under large bathroom components (like tubs and vanity cabinets)?</li>
<li>Does tile seam width change the purchase amount?</li>
<li>For wall tile, how far up does the tile go?</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What you will measure:<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"> </span></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>You will begin with one set of measurements: those that cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Next, you tighten up that set of numbers by taking variables into account.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What you will need to measure for bathroom tile:</strong></h3>
<p>Begin with a tape measure, preferably one with a metal blade 1-inch wide or more for rigidity. Do not use a vinyl measuring tape of the type used for clothing and other fabrics. A laser measuring device is a great add-on but is not necessary.</p>
<p>You will also need a simple way to jot down numbers. Pen and paper work best, but if you are working with an app or program, you can use that. Having an extra hand, too, eases the process and produces more accurate numbers.</p>
<h3>Getting the fixed dimensions</h3>
<p>Certain dimensions in a bathroom are fixed; meaning, they cannot be changed. Begin there.</p>
<p><strong>To measure the bathroom floor tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure the dimensions of the entire bathroom. Measure from one wall to the opposite wall. Then, measure the other walls from side to side. If the room has alcoves or areas in addition to that larger floor space, measure those separately as if they were separate rooms.</li>
<li>Measure the available floor space that will be tiled. Measure only the floor area that will be tiled. Rather than subtracting non-tiled areas (such as bathtubs) from the overall dimensions of the room, measure the floor space on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To measure the bathroom wall tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full-wall tile runs from the floor to the ceiling. Areas near showers and bathtubs often receive tile from floor to ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a tile wainscot?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tile wainscot is a tile field that runs partially up the bathroom wall. Forty-two inches is a common wainscot height for a bathroom with a 7-foot or 8-foot ceiling. Even better, measure the height of the ceiling, then divide by one-third and use that as your wainscot height.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42027 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-15.jpeg" alt="black and white shower tile" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-15.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-15-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-15-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-15-585x390.jpeg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><strong>To measure the shower wall and floor tile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Measure all shower walls from side to side and top to bottom. Do not account for the shower pan or shower curb.</li>
<li>For the shower pan, measure from side to side in both directions to produce the area measurement.</li>
<li>If the curb or threshold will be tiled, assume a height on both sides of at least 2 inches and a width of at least 2 inches. Shower curbs may not rise more than 9 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tips to control for variables:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tape measure will sag, so keep it as straight and level as possible. This is the benefit of having an assistant: to keep the tape measure tight. A laser measuring tool is helpful for distances over 8 to 10 feet, as it produces a straight line.</li>
<li>Ignore baseboards, as tile overlaps baseboards. Be sure to measure from wall to wall, not from baseboard to baseboard.</li>
<li>Subtract cutouts down to the square foot. Items less than a square foot, such as the toilet flange or shower drain, should not be subtracted.</li>
<li>If the sink cabinet will stay in place and you are certain that the bathroom layout will never change, do not tile under the cabinet. Subtract the cabinet from the flooring area.</li>
<li>If you think that you will change the bathroom layout in the future, tile underneath the sink cabinet.</li>
<li>Tile usually does not run under the shower or bathtub. Do not figure shower or tub floor space into your measurements.</li>
<li>Interior tile grout widths range from 1/16-inch to 1/4-inch. Unless this is an unusually large bathroom, do not use grout widths as a variable when measuring for bathroom tile.</li>
<li>Site-built showers do not always need tiled shower pans and curbs. You may subtract this quantity of tile if you expect to use a prefabricated shower pan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using your measurements to purchase bathroom tile</h3>
<p>Once you have a solid set of numbers in hand, you&#8217;re ready to buy the materials. You will need to consider a few issues before you make the final purchase.</p>
<h4>Tile overage: How much extra bathroom tile should I buy?</h4>
<p>After you adjust the fixed quantity of tiles with the control variables, you now have the total amount of tile required—almost! The last step is to plan for a standard overage amount of 10% or more.</p>
<p>For example, a 100-square-foot bathroom with 10% overage results in a purchase of 110 square feet of tile.</p>
<p>Products may <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrive damaged or otherwise unusable</a>. Too many unusable products must be returned, but a broken tile or two may not be worth the effort. More importantly, it is nearly impossible to order exactly the amount of tiles that will be laid down. Field tile edges are typically cut to fit the space. While tile installers strive to recycle cut pieces in other areas of the project, some pieces cannot be used. Boxed tile, too, often ends up with extra tiles left in the box.</p>
<h4>Special-shape or unique-size tiles and layout designs</h4>
<p>Most tiles are square or rectangular, and most layouts are grid or brick patterns. What happens if you vary the tile size or layout?</p>
<p>Unique tile shapes and sizes require that you purchase more tile. If these types of tiles cannot produce a straight edge when laid, increase the overage to 20% or more.</p>
<p>Layouts that differ from grid or brick patterns also require more tile. Diagonal, herringbone, or chevron patterns, for example, result in cut pieces in a variety of triangular sizes. Some triangles can be used elsewhere, but most cannot.</p>
<p class="p1">Measuring your bathroom for tile will give you a good idea of the material cost to add to your budget. When you’re ready to get started on your bathroom or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4>Other factors for measuring bathroom tile</h4>
<p>The ease with which you can return the tiles is an important factor to consider. A brick-and-mortar store may accept sealed, full-box returns for full value or for full value minus a stocking fee. Online tile suppliers may require you to pay to ship back unused tile.</p>
<p>Having some extra tile on hand has its benefits. Over time, installed tile may crack and need to be replaced. Or you may wish to use the tile for smaller applications within the bathroom, such as for a sink backsplash.</p>
<h5>Best tile and applications for bathroom flooring</h5>
<p>All bathroom flooring tiles should be specified as such by the manufacturer in the product description or in the technical specifications. Wall-only tile cannot be used for floors, as it is too thin for foot traffic and often too slippery.</p>
<p>Another clue is the COF (or coefficient of friction) slip ratings published by tile manufacturers. For foot traffic, higher numbers are better than lower numbers. Look for a COF rating of 0.50 or more for your floor tile.</p>
<p>Grout seams are necessary between floor tiles. Wide seams impart more friction, thus a safer floor. More seams, too, give the foot friction. This is one reason why <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mosaic tiles</a> are so popular for floor tiles: the increased proportion of grout to tiles.</p>
<h5>Best tile and applications for bathroom walls</h5>
<p>Like floor tile, manufacturers often label bathroom wall tile. However, in most cases, you can use bathroom floor tiles for bathroom walls.</p>
<p>One exception is with showers, bathtubs, and other high-moisture areas. Look for tiles with a water absorption rate of 0.5 percent or lower. Tiles labeled specifically with the name “porcelain,” as certified by the Porcelain Tile Certification Agency (PTCA), are guaranteed to fall under the absorption rate range.</p>
<p>Given the visibility of bathroom wall tile, it is often best practice to keep tile seams narrower, to use more routine layouts, and to use tiles with less complex visuals. Highly ornate types of tiles are acceptable but are best limited to use in borders or for smaller applications, like backsplashes.</p>
<p>Having a shortage of tile will cause delays, while ordering too much tile affects your budget. Use this guide to measure bathroom tile accurately and you&#8217;ll get even closer to the exact tile quantity you need!</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Houston natives can list many great things about the city: Houston is one of the most diverse cities in the South, and it has a vibrant culture. Houston residents enjoy a relatively low cost of living. But if there is one aspect about Houston that most residents would like to change, it’s the floods. In Houston and Harris County, floods affect huge sections of the city on a regular basis. </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines ways to protect your home from flooding in Houston. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why Houston floods devastate homes</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Houston’s wet season, from May to October, brings a punishing round of tropical storms, hurricanes, or just old-fashioned heavy rain. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Houston rests near Galveston Bay, four major bayous, and numerous creeks. Floods are a fact of life in a city surrounded by so much water. If you live west of the city center, your home will generally hold up better during flooding. Residents of EaDo (East Downtown), Garden Oaks, Highland Village, and Midtown tend to fare better than other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">M</span><span class="s3">oving eastward from the city center increases the likelihood of high water levels and floods. </span><span class="s1">Kingwood, Spring Branch, the Heights, and Sharpstown all flood regularly. </span><span class="s2">Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda turned these neighborhoods brown with floodwater</span><span class="s1">. The storms hit Meyerland, located mostly within the 100-year floodplain, particularly hard.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Houston and Harris County are so heavily paved-over that runoff water cannot keep pace with these huge increases of water. Short of </span><span class="s4">moving to another city, you can take a number of steps to protect your home: </span></p>
<h4 class="p8"><span class="s1">Tip 1: Grade soil away from your house</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Houston&#8217;s mostly flat topography only rises about 50 feet above sea level. You won&#8217;t find steep hills and high elevation in this city. But you can create a type of &#8220;micro-elevation&#8221; on your own property.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When building or renovating your house, redesign your property’s grading. Regrade with proper water, erosion, and storm runoff management in mind. You want to avoid your yard and home turning into a lake.</span></p>
<h4 class="p8"><span class="s1">Tip 2: Install a sump pump and maintain it</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If your Houston <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">house has a basement</a>, it undoubtedly already has a sump pump. If not, install one immediately. Sump pumps discharge interior water to the exterior. It is valuable for high waters or for minor interior flooding. However, it will not protect your home against catastrophic flooding. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your sump pump should be ready to turn on at any time. If not, it may experience power loss, clogging, or switch issues. If the unit cannot keep up with the water, install a larger unit. </span><span class="s1">The average lifespan of a sump pump is about 10 years. If your sump pump is at the end of this lifespan, consider replacing it.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 3: Raise your house</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The best solution to protect your home from a Houston flood is to elevate it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">At a very minimum, the City of Houston requires homes to have a one-foot elevation above the 100-year floodplain. But that minimum nowhere nearly addresses catastrophic events, like the rapid 12-inch rainfall that fell during Hurricane Harvey. If you plan on elevating your house, experts recommend elevating your home over 18 inches. Six-foot elevations are not uncommon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">When building a new house, resist the urge to build slab-on-grade if living in a flood-prone section. Instead, explore elevated foundations of three feet or more. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">If you already own a house, you can retroactively elevate your house. This retrofit begins much like a house move, with the house raised by jacks on piers. But the house isn’t loaded onto trucks and moved. Instead, a new, higher foundation is placed under the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Elevating your home starts at about $75 per square foot. It&#8217;s a major project that can take up to three months to complete.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 4: Dry floodproof your foundation</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Imagine the outer part of your home’s foundation wall as the hull of a boat. Water constantly surround a boat&#8217;s lower half, so it must be watertight. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Dry floodproofing treats your foundation with sealants and membranes. If water surrounds the lower section for a limited period, there should be little or no leakage into the home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">With dry floodproofing, the emphasis is on positive-side (exterior) sealants and membranes. Workers also apply negative-side (interior) sealants and membranes. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">FEMA recommends homeowners opt for a “substantially impermeable wall.” The wall helps limit water accumulation. In 24 hours, water will accumulate to a 4-inch maximum with a sump pump. </span><span class="s1">Entrust this project to a qualified contractor who has experience in dry floodproofing. Contractors well-versed in this project can often exceed that FEMA minimum performance level.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 5: Install flood vents</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">In lieu of dry floodproofing, consider installing flood vents. </span><span class="s1">Contractors can install FEMA-compliant flood vents in your foundation walls. In dry times, these vents prohibit vermin from entering underneath your house. During floods, these vents open freely to allow the passage of floodwaters. At the same time, these vents block debris that can damage the structure.</span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">Flood vents may also help you reduce your flood insurance premiums. </span><span class="s1">Houston homes receive so much structural damage because of the force of the water on the foundations. Flood vents reduce that pressure.</span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Only certain types of foundations require flood vents. Many older Houston homes have a crawlspace foundation that supports the house with piers or columns. This foundation often has a skirt or non-load-bearing wall around the house perimeter. Sometimes, brick or concrete comprises the skirt wall instead of wood. Because the wall cannot hold back floodwaters, dry floodproofing is not a viable option. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Many Houston contractors can advise you on how to protect your home from flooding in Houston. They can assess whether dry floodproofing or flood vent installation is your best option.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 6: Install and maintain a backflow valve</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">During floods, one unhappy byproduct is sewer or water drainage backflow. During this, backflow sends sewer water into the house. Floodwater itself is dirty enough. But when sewage pipes directly into your home, that only adds insult to injury. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Some backflow valves are automatic, such as ball float valves in floor drains. On the other hand, manually-operated gate-style valves open and close by turning a wheel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Note that backflow valves prevent your house’s sewage from running into the sewer main. Standard backflow valves provide no way for you to <span class="s1"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flush a toilet</a></span>. Speak to your contractor about backflow valves with ejector pump attachments. These attachments can divert your sewage back into the sewer system, while still preventing backflow from coming into your home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">More ways to prevent or ease flood damage in Houston</span></h3>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Raise exterior outlets </span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Electrical code typically requires only that exterior outlets be accessible from grade, or ground, level. For Houston with its floods, this usually translates to “too low.” </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">An electrician can relocate your exterior GFCI outlets. The outlets should be at least one foot above the expected flood line.</span></p>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><b>Check your exterior drainage system</b></span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Your house’s gutters collect rainwater from the roof. Drainpipes move that water downward. Make sure that this interdependent system works properly which your contractor can assess. If your system needs repairs, they can recommend and install solutions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><b>Install waterproof flooring at (or below) grade</b></span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">If your home’s lowest level is on-grade or is below-grade (like a basement), avoid installing carpet, solid hardwood, or engineered wood flooring. As long as that level remains dry, you are fine. But if that level overflows with water, the best response is to remove the flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Hard-surface, 100-percent waterproof flooring stands a good chance for successful cleanup. Consider installing ceramic or porcelain tile, resilient plank, sheet, or tile floor.</span></p>
<p>Using these ways to protect your home from flooding will provide peace-of-mind. Understanding your options based on your budget and the type of home you have is a good start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to remodel your garage into living space, a rental studio, or even a gym</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45280" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg" alt="garage remodel nashville" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are like many homeowners, you may be looking in all directions to increase living space. Looking upward means building a second story. Looking toward the back translates to a house addition. But one direction that is often overlooked is to the side or front: the garage. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how a garage remodel in Nashville could be your solution amid several home addition options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Types of garage remodels</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living rooms or family rooms</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide supplemental living or family room space. The garage is insulated, wired, painted, and flooring is installed. Sometimes, a small powder room, with only a toilet and sink, is added. The powder room eliminates trips to the main part of the house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for renters</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some homeowners choose to install a self-contained apartment for renters. This arrangement can give the homeowner a source of passive income. Over the long term, it may defray the cost of the garage remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living quarters typically include a bedroom, full bathroom, and a kitchen. A lockable pass-through to the main part of the home is usually included. With this, homeowners can lock the door on their side to prevent the renters from entering. Most remodels of this nature include a separate exterior door so that renters can enter their apartment without going through the main house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for self or family</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide living quarters for elderly parents, friends, or children. In many cases, this apartment has the same facilities as does an apartment for renters. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Dedicated entertainment or work area</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your garage remodel may create a single room or multiple rooms for a specific purpose. The remodeled garage may become an entertainment room, home movie theater, gym, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office, workshop, or studio</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel costs in Nashville</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Garage remodel permits alone can cost $1,000 to $1,500. For a simple living-room space that does not include plumbing, the cost will begin in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. Most of this cost is devoted to outfitting the space with a floor and filling in the garage door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">More often, though, garage remodels intended as living quarters begin at $20,000 and rise sharply.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel process and timeline</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Before you speak to a contractor, decide on the primary function for the remodel. A basic family or living room can be a relatively simple project since plumbing may not be involved. A full-scale rental apartment will be more expensive and will take several weeks or months.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After you’ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received multiple estimates</a> and chosen your contractor, discuss if any Nashville overlay and zoning issues need to be considered.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">You will meet with the contractor and an architect. The architect will draw up plans. The contractor applies for permits.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After a roll-off dumpster is delivered to the property, workers demolish parts of the interior of the garage. The garage door is removed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters fill in the empty space where the garage door was located. Usually, this will be an exterior wall system, complete with insulation and perhaps even windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Depending on the plan, workers may need to frame the floor with joists. This will raise the floor to the height of the main house’s floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">With the walls open, electricians and plumbers run wire and pipes through the walls.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters frame the interior walls and the ceiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Workers add a heating and cooling system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Drywall installers hang and finish the drywall.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Floor installers add the floor covering of your choice on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">A painting team will paint the inside of the garage remodel. They will also paint areas outside of the garage, in front.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Plumbers finish installing bathroom fixtures. Electricians complete the rest of the wiring.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">How a garage remodel affects house value</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One important consideration before starting a garage remodel is whether it will increase the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you are considering a garage remodel in Nashville, you might be thinking of immediate, personal needs. Your family may be increasing in size. Or you may have elderly parents who need housing. In either case, remodeling your garage may represent a lower net financial cost than building a separate structure or buying a new house.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if you do intend to eventually sell your home, consider how the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garage remodel will affect your home’s value</a>. Potential home buyers may view the lack of vehicle storage as a deficit. Other buyers may welcome the extra space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and restrictions</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City of Nashville requires a building permit for any new building or a modification of an existing structure. You must also have permits for individual tradework, such as for electrical, plumbing, or HVAC work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nashville is a city of many historic structures. The Nashville Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission (MHZC) was formed to protect Nashville’s architectural styles and character. If your home is located in a historic preservation and historic landmark overlay, you must apply for a Preservation Permit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MHZC permit applications require a full set of plans, elevations, photos, and more. After you submit the permit application, the MHZC will meet to consider your project. After a permit is approved, you must stick to the conditions of the permit. For example, the MHZC will impose penalties or injunctions if the garage siding does not match that of the rest of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Nashville and Davidson County, neighborhood leaders and government officials take a close look at Airbnb-type rentals. These types of rentals are called Short Term Rental Properties (STRPs). The Metro Codes Department must approve of your rental property before you list it as an STRP (but not before you build it).</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Heat and cool your garage remodel in Nashville</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Nashville’s extremes of heat and cold, you should add a heating or cooling system to your garage remodel. Generally, there are three options:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Continue with the main house’s HVAC system. Workers continue the ductwork from the main house into the garage. The main house’s HVAC system must be adequate to handle the increased loads. This option works well when remodeling a garage for a living or family room: one that will flow seamlessly from the main house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Install a separate HVAC system. This is the best option when remodeling a garage as living quarters. It is also the costliest option.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">The lowest cost installation option is heating in the form of baseboard or wall heaters. For cooling, install one or more window or wall unit air conditioners. Installation is less expensive but the cost of service is higher. This is because baseboard heaters, wall heaters, and window unit A/Cs are less efficient than HVAC systems.<br />

<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Where to park your vehicles</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When reviewing permit applications for garage remodels in Nashville, the city will want to know where the displaced vehicles will go. Like most large cities, Nashville wants to reduce the number of cars that are street-parked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a paved driveway, the solution can be as simple as moving the cars to the driveway instead of in the garage. This is the lowest cost solution, though your vehicles will be left out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have ample room in the front of your property, you may wish to build a carport or even a new garage. This will completely or partially protect the vehicles. It also may appeal to future buyers. Zoning issues may come into play since a 20-foot setback in front must be maintained. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A garage remodel is a lower-cost alternative to building an addition but it is not low-cost. Think of a garage remodel as an investment in your home’s value and in your happiness.</span></p>
