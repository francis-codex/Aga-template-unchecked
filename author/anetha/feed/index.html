<p class="p1">This pre-war bathroom is a glamorous mix of brass fixtures with classic elements. The clean lines of the vanity and lighting mixed with the traditional curves of the plumbing fixtures create an elegant bathing space. Additionally, modern features, such as the LED-lighted medicine cabinet, bring the space into the 21st century.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Reber, founder of The Contractor Fight, reveals why stats and client trust are important</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg" alt="Tom Raber Contractor Fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this second of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gets advice from Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>, on what stats to focus on, what he tells his coaching groups to initiate change, and how to sell for a higher profit. You can also hear more on his podcasts. <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-do-i-grow-my-general-contracting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read Part 1</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important stats for contractors when they’re looking to grow their business? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First off, don’t be intimidated by the numbers—it is just scorekeeping. Think of it like fantasy football stats &#8211; you need to run the plays that get the most yardage. Using data will help you make better decisions. Like fantasy football or baseball, work on your “stats” weekly and be objective. How many times did the phone ring? Where did your leads come from? What was the size of the job? How much did you spend to get that lead? What is the close rate of all the leads from that source, how many closed?</span></p>
<p>The numbers tell you where to focus. Don’t shy away from them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>Note:</em> Tom discusses more about stats on <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">his podcast.</span></a> You can also <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">monitor how your business is doing</span></a> when you are part of the Sweeten network.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the top three things you encourage GCs to start doing when they join your program?</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s1">1. Engage with a like-minded community</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may sound remedial but, first and foremost, I encourage general contractors to join our online community. The first step is to get engaged—don’t be a wallflower. It is like joining a gym, and then not going—that won’t get you any closer to your goals. Get in, ask questions, engage, be present. This is a like-minded community, so share your story and listen to the stories of others. If you follow the system, it will work for you. </span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">2. Define the first problem</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get clarity around the very first issue you want to fix. You need to define that first problem. Focus on one issue and go all-in on that. Use the frameworks provided to double down and knock down that first domino. You have to dedicate time and energy to the problem, which means you won’t be able to fix everything at once.</span></p>
<h4>3. Focus on your first problem every day</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you have defined that first domino, build consistent habits around tackling that problem, so it always stays top of mind. Then create a checklist of three things and do it every day. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important things to do when looking to start selling jobs with a higher profit? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a hard look at your numbers</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">First off, you need to give yourself a reality check (via the job-costing exercise). At least 75% of general contractors do not know or understand their own numbers. In my program, when we take them through their numbers, it is an eye-opening experience. It&#8217;s possible to sell jobs with a 50% profit. It doesn&#8217;t sound possible but it can be done.</span></p>
<h4>Sharpen your communication skills</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get your sales process in order. How you communicate with a prospective client makes a huge difference. Most contractors think it is about the scope of work or price, but it is absolutely about human connection and understanding the homeowner’s motives. Practice by role-playing with the online community. Oh, and listen when people talk; don’t just think about what you plan to say next!</span></p>
<h4>How to build trust with clients</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, “mind the gap”—this is the time between the sale and the work being done. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t go silent:</strong><span class="s3"> Continue to add value during this time by educating them so they feel great about their decision to hire you. This builds trust and makes it a great experience.  </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Do what you say you will when you promise to do it:</strong><span class="s3"> Being trustworthy and having integrity is critical to this business and being able to charge higher prices. </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t blame customers for being cheap: </strong><span class="s3">Ask yourself first “have I done everything I can to make sure this customer feels heard?”</span><span class="s1"><i><br />
</i></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this first of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> talks with Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>. Tom explains how to start job-costing, discussing profit and overhead with clients, and common issues that general contractors are facing within his coaching groups. You can also check out <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/category/the-contractor-fight-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking. It may seem remedial, but that is where most people need to start.</p>
