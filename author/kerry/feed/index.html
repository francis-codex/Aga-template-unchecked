</ul>
<h3>Keeping the gallery style</h3>
<p>Since<a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/"> galley kitchens</a> are, by definition, usually small and narrow, renovators typically decide to open up the layout as much as possible when remodeling—whether it involves partially removing a wall or creating a passthrough. However, Daniel, a Culinary Director at Serious Eats and his wife, Kate (a director at <em>VICE</em>) decided to buck the trend and embrace their floor plan, updating it to make it a true chef&#8217;s kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="669" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21198" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-Portrait-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p>There were some very visible problems that had to be addressed. The kitchen’s floor tiles had developed corrosive stains over time that could not be scrubbed clean, the cabinets extended to a generic height that wasted space, and some unfortunate layout decisions positioned an old, hulking fridge at the entryway. Worse, the fridge and stove footprints forced the right side of the galley into three abridged sections that were not useful for real food prep. On the other side, plumbing risers in the wall pushed one section of cabinetry out by a few inches, creating an odd corner in the middle of the countertop and adding a few inches of cabinet bulk right at eye level above the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44783" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21173" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-03-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>In need of more functionality</h3>
<p>Design flaws aside, the room felt claustrophobic, so most visitors assumed that the problem was with the galley itself. Common in pre-war apartments, the dividing wall between the kitchen and dining room could conceivably have come down, and everyone asked about it. But Daniel and Kate found themselves advocating for preservation as the galley began to play a central role in their big-picture decision-making. Ultimately, Daniel felt really comfortable in a galley: It was like a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate turned to </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for help in finding a design and build firm. They had saved up for this renovation and wanted it to be right—making their two-bedroom, pre-war apartment in Jackson Heights, New York, even more desirable.</span></p>

<h3>Perfecting the details</h3>
<p>The general contractor that Daniel and Kate found through Sweeten shared the couple&#8217;s vision, committing to getting the fridge out of the entryway as well as installing custom cabinets to expand storage vertically. Offset cabinets were traded in for open shelving above the sink.</p>
<p>Daniel also appreciated the contractor&#8217;s focus on design decisions like cabinet door orientation and space between features, freeing him up to get a few chef’s details exactly right. Daniel wanted to avoid putting the microwave in a prominent spot and was concerned about cleanliness in an above-stove location. It now lives on an open shelf underneath the counter, where it’s an accessible tool but not a visible feature.</p>

<h3>Custom kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p>The Sweeten contractor created a dedicated cabinet for cutting boards, and most pots and pans are found in pull-out sliding cabinets rather than stacked in drawers, so they take up less space but are still easily grabbed. A towel bar, mounted just below the counter by the sink, has become major real estate with S-hooks added for small items for hanging.</p>
<p>Daniel and Kate decided on marble hex tile for the floors. It brings a natural element of warmth with a shape that is familiar in homes of a similar era, and it bounces light from the kitchen window with a little glow. Color for the custom cabinets became a tortured decision. Daniel and Kate paid extra for additional cabinet samples when they found that paint swatches didn’t really help them envision different tones, and agreed on a navy finish that paired well with brass accents already in the home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44785" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44787" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A kitchen for cooks</h3>
<p>Daniel aimed for a real chef’s prep space with sections of cherry butcher block. It needs mineral oil but is otherwise not that hard to maintain with cutting boards regularly in the rotation. Around the sink, the couple chose a section of white quartz for easy maintenance and to protect the butcher block from water stains. Standard white subway tile adds a simple gleam and contrast between the cabinet lines.</p>
<p>Being avid cooks, Daniel and Kate really wanted to have appliances that could elevate their culinary skills. Key considerations for a new stove were powerful burner output and controls on the front of the oven; having the control panel on the back stand was too out of the way. Recipe experiments and heavy use mean that a food writer’s oven can get pretty gunky, so extra points for minimal nooks and grooves went to the stove they chose. The sink is an undermount with nice depth for lots of pots and pans, and the faucet is a simple gooseneck model with no side accents that might get in the way of a scrub down.</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This feature, originally published in the summer of 2015, is one of Sweeten&#8217;s favorite dramatic makeovers. An overpowering closet flanking the existing galley kitchen seemed to squeeze the entry even tighter. The changes, though, were striking: the walls came down, and newly-placed high gloss cabinets took the spotlight, amplified in natural light. The affordability of this <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full IKEA kitchen</a> renovation is an extra bonus. The takeaway: a bit of shiny goes a long way.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee Hoffman bought a 1+ bedroom, 1 bathroom co-op in Midtown East. The original kitchen and bathroom were beyond forlorn; the kitchen was hidden behind a walled entryway and was more of a hallway than a room. This might have been initially helpful during its heyday in 1978, but not ideal in an apartment that depended on the kitchen window for extra light in the living room. Lee did months and months of research on ways to update the space. He came to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor who could change up a cramped kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update a plain bathroom</a>.</p>

<p>After reviewing a selection of Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Manhattan</a>, he chose one to re-envision the space with some nice cabinets and tile. However, the renovation turned into much more than that.</p>
<h3>Tackling a cramped kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee found himself up against one major, invisible force when he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started the kitchen project</a>: the co-op&#8217;s previous tenant had been a smoker and the original stock finishes were covered in smoky residue. The layout for the already-small kitchen didn&#8217;t work well. The space was virtually sealed off from the living room, and its big window was partially blocked by cabinetry and a fridge that had been wedged into the galley. Lee knew he could swap in new cabinets and appliances. However, when <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing options with his contractor</a>, he learned that the dividing wall was non-load-bearing. Removing the wall would let light into the living room from two directions. He put together a lengthy list of &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221; (from wall demolition all the way down to soft-close cabinets). The same approach was used to bring light and modern appeal to the crumbling bathroom.</p>

<h3>An IKEA kitchen fit the budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee took on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut remodel of the kitchen</a> with the determination of a tech entrepreneur. He spent a month talking to every cabinet maker in NYC before accepting that even the lowest price for a high-end, custom-built set was way <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond his budget</a>. Even the next tier down felt costly, and the slightly more budget-friendly options at big-box retailers didn&#8217;t seem like an obvious slam dunk. After reading positive reviews about IKEA cabinets, and realizing that a whole new IKEA line was about to hit the market, he found himself psyched by the look of the white, high-gloss lacquer Sektion option.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-27638 size-full" title="close-up of kitchen drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="702" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The cost-benefit of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/galley-kitchen-renovation-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing IKEA kitchen cabinets</a> for a completely new look was immediately evident: for well under $10K, Lee got a full set of high gloss kitchen cabinets <em>and</em> was really happy with the quality. The downside? Getting delivery right took weeks of follow-up and re-shipments to get all of the pieces on site. It was a great deal overall, but most definitely not without headaches and hand-holding.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27651 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="713" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-300x214.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

<p>Lee&#8217;s research paid off in other parts of the kitchen. He loved the look of white marble and spent six months on the hunt for a quartz countertop with a similar feel, ultimately landing on a porcelain slab by Euro West with an almost-identical yet indestructible effect. (Don&#8217;t miss our guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing countertop materials</a> for your own kitchen!)</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27652 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="715" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-300x215.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To stay on budget, Lee decided to skip a typical tiled backsplash. With the newly-opened room, and with an upper row of cabinets only on one side, it ended up being a smart choice. Lee thought carefully about cabinet placement<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>drawers only along the left (16&#8243; depth to maximize open space) and a slim row of upper cabinets centered on the right. The team installed the counter-depth Liebherr fridge against the back wall and lined up all other appliances: a Samsung stove, a stainless steel Blomberg dishwasher, and a Blanco Quatrus sink on the opposite side. Their placement left plenty of room in all directions for food prep and hosting.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27630 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1413" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01-212x300.jpg 212w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-01-600x848.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Starting from scratch for the bathroom refresh</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as Lee <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started this project</a>, he knew he had little sentimental feelings about the bathroom. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan for the bathroom</a> was straightforward: Everything had to go. In its place, the room would receive a lot of clean, bright whites and crisp glass. He selected a touchless San Souci Kohler toilet, &#8220;designed for OCD people,&#8221; in his words, and a Kohler recessed medicine cabinet above the Fresca sink vanity. The bathroom hardware is all Hansgrohe; a full shower suite with all of its bells and whistles. Lee&#8217;s heavy research brought in one more big catch: he found a specialty <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass shower door</a> from Mirage Shower Doors that eliminates the slight green aura that lots of shower doors end up with. Glassos white wall tiles were the final reflective touch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A sunny guest bedroom &amp; spare office space emerge with help from interior windows</h2>
<p>The alcove has long played a supporting role in many post-war city apartments &#8212; a flexible, windowed nook off the living room that can pass for an office or a nursery, or turn a studio into an almost-but-not-quite one-bedroom. Lots of possibilities, but typically one big compromise: leave the alcove open and lose the privacy of extra sleeping space, or close it off and lose extra light and views. For a family moving from Washington, DC, to Washington Heights, a Sweeten renovation transformed a living room and alcove with some of the loveliest space-saving solutions we’ve seen yet. Read on down to see how this family of three made the move work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19997 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> <em>Guest post by Deeksha Gaur, Manhattan homeowner and co-founder of <a href="https://www.show-score.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Show-Score.com</a></em></span></p>
<h3>A young family finds their first home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In November of 2014, Joe and I moved back to New York City from Washington, DC. When we last lived in Manhattan, we were a young couple who had just moved in together, renting a place in Chelsea and living the New York dream. Three years later we were back, married, and with a three-month-old in tow. We hoped to buy our first home as a new family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before our move, we came up to NYC to explore our options and see just how unrealistic our wish list was! After a long and disappointing day of showings, we drove up to a co-op building in Washington Heights. The building was warm, unpretentious and full of families. The apartment itself was spacious, well-cared for, and had the most gorgeous views of the George Washington Bridge. The manager told us that the building was home to musicians, actors, and all sorts of artists and creative types. Now, I was pinching myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the aesthetics of the apartment weren’t to our tastes, it was easy to imagine a set-up where the living area could be light and airy, a perfect palette for the art that makes our house a home wherever we happen to be living. We could imagine the perfect first bedroom for our son and we envisioned ways to make the dark kitchen a little brighter. In other words, it was clear that with a little work, this was the perfect first home for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19926 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01.jpg" alt="deeksha_living_room-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a double-duty space for guests and work</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, while we were lucky to have found a great two-bedroom apartment, we regularly have friends and family come from across the globe to spend extended periods of time with us. We knew we could create a spare room from the foot of our L-shaped living room, but that part of the house has great light and views, and we didn’t want to lose it behind opaque drywall. So, we needed a unique solution for a partition that could afford both privacy and openness. Our dream solution was a sort of hybrid window wall that was partly opaque partition and partly interior windows—but, we had no idea if this was remotely feasible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second, we have a lot of books and not a lot of storage. Plus, we needed a primo spot for the television. I have always been a big fan of the floor-to-ceiling built-in bookcases you see in old NYC apartments, and adding that kind of a feature seemed like the perfect solution—both practically and aesthetically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to dealing with these large carpentry projects, we had undertaken a few small updates and renovations—a widening of a doorway here, some paint there, fun wallpaper for our son’s first room, etc. We had been really unhappy with our contractor and so we were extra-nervous about jumping into an even bigger home improvement. This negative experience had left us paralyzed. We wanted to make the changes but didn’t know where to go next. Then, a friend told us about Sweeten. She’d had her kitchen redone and was beyond thrilled. (You can see her Sweeten renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/clinton-hill-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)

<h3>Finding the husband-wife dream contractor team on Sweeten</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t have enough words to communicate just how seamless this process was. We were connected with three people, all amazing! They were consummate professionals and visionary designers. We knew we would be in good hands with any of them. But in the end, we were thrilled to work with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. It was clear from the very beginning that he was a perfectionist and would help shape and execute our vision beautifully and with great care. And both he and his wife, Rachel, were very helpful and responsive to all of our questions and concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got to visit him at his workshop in Peekskill, NY, and see the impressive array of projects he was working on. But best of all, he grasped our needs right away. He was able to take our nascent design ideas and turn them into computer renderings that allowed us to see our vision come to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a few alterations, we signed off on the design and our contractor got to building. A couple of weeks before the install, he worked with us to pick our own cabinet and drawer pulls for the bookcase, as well as the doorknob for our new third bedroom, all of which we got from Anthropologie. The install itself took a little under three days, and our contractor&#8217;s perfectionism came to the fore, as he perfectly placed each doorknob, and touched up every nick and scratch. He was so great, in fact, that we recommended him to our neighbors, for whom he also created a part-glass wall partition and built-ins.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s amazing work transformed our house into a home. When I walk into the house and sit on our couch and read or watch TV, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be. With the partition of interior windows, we&#8217;ve kept the gorgeous views that made us fall in love with the place to begin with. Now we just need to install some window blinds to give our guests some privacy when they stay!</p>

<h3>Brightening up the space</h3>
<p>Racing to line up an ambitious renovation before closing on a dated co-op in Woodside, Queens, Maria, a financial reporting director at a major media company, and Eric, the owner and Creative Director at broadcast design studio <a href="https://www.generalidea.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Idea</a>, expected “pain and horror” as first-time renovators. They’d linked up with an architectural designer and came to Sweeten to find a general contractor to overhaul all 850 square feet of their new two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>Some of the finishes were just plain uninspired, while other layout and fixture details limited a more holistic use of the space. Laminate counters and discolored floor tiles anchored the kitchen, warped cupboards demanded a good nudge to shut completely, and the small bathroom’s ornate pedestal sink went way overboard on frilly decorative details while way under-delivering on countertop real estate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-53590 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-23.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Creating a team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goals were pretty straightforward: open up the enclosed kitchen to the living room, update the kitchen and bathroom, and refinish the floors. Still, their designer, <a href="https://www.vidachang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vida</a>, brought three critical points of view to the project. One was technical and practical: to limit work to the existing structural and plumbing layout so that the crew could focus on visible details that mattered most. The second was connectedness: Vida posted the project on Sweeten to find local contractors matched to the project’s budget and scope, freeing her up to focus on design solutions. And the third was creative: clean design details and a minimalist style found in matte finishes, simple profiles, and rich walnut wood warmth. They were matched with their Sweeten contractor for demolition, rebuilding, and craftsmanship detail down to the new doorknobs.</p>

<h3>A gallery kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric wanted an open, bright space with clean lines. They had drawn up a 3D model on their own to convey big ideas, and worked closely with Vida to fine-tune, leaning toward Scandinavian sensibilities with some mid-century modern touches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor&#8217;s team took on the kitchen wall, which sectioned the galley kitchen off in its own corner. To give Eric and Maria the open feeling they wanted, the designs called for approaching the two galley walls strategically. On one side, countertop prep space takes the lead, wrapping around the kitchen wall and extending into the living room with low walnut cabinet storage. Skipping the usual line of upper cabinets in this spot helps keep the living room open through to the kitchen’s window. On the opposite wall, full-height cabinets concentrate storage but still keep a low profile with matte white finishes and concealed hardware. The stainless Bosch appliances and a striking black sink and faucet combo star in this otherwise simple space.</p>

<h3>Making a space space feel bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom’s small footprint led the team to focus on storage solutions and a simple palette. High contrast black and white materials, a frameless mirror, matte black plumbing fixtures (even under the wall mount sink!), and recessed wall storage gave Eric and Maria a bright and uncluttered retreat. The floor tile was admittedly a splurge, but with just a few square feet of coverage needed, it made sense to focus a high-end finish in that small spot.</p>

<h3>Updated floors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room and bedrooms, the team stripped walls and focused on restoring the existing wood flooring. Getting the floors right was a challenge. Aiming for a serene, matte oiled finish required the team to strip the previous stain and try out a few approaches with a new topcoat. The new finish, a layer of natural sheen, is an updated take on the original material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53574 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg" alt="white on wood bedroom design" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Bumps in the road</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria and Eric planned to use the second bedroom as a home office and needed to reframe the entry to open it up to the living room. The custom pocket door is their favorite design detail, a necessary addition after finding an unexpected structural beam which could have prevented the plans for a floor-to-ceiling entry. Vida suggested encasing the beam in walnut, with an asymmetrical line. It&#8217;s a beautiful and unique solution that helps tie in design touches from each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-53585 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg" alt="open bright living room" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12877-Eric-Apt-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With their expert team in place, Maria and Eric found that communication was key. They had detailed conversations about measurements, finishes, and placement prior to work starting, saving time and headaches. Their contractor&#8217;s team helped keep the project on track and were key partners in addressing issues that came up as work progressed. Vida kept balance and prioritization top of mind to negotiate cost, quality, and lead times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And behind the scenes at Sweeten, we saw in-progress photos of those show-stopping black fixtures when the Sweeten contractor checked in with updates throughout the project (with Queens cheesecake hand-delivered on a visit to our offices!). What a complete treat for us to be able to show off all of this beautiful finished work!</p>

<h3>Making a vision reality</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before buying, Casey and Kumar, who are both designers at <a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Miller Atre</a>, thought whether they could find a home that would allow their family to stay in New York. Moving out of the city for more space seemed like the only option. Then they discovered a one-bedroom in Clinton Hill with a wall of south-facing windows.</p>

			<h3>Planning a multipurpose room</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a one-bedroom work for their four-person family, Casey and Kumar closely examined routines and patterns in their daily lives. Their sons, Luc and River, needed quiet when they went off to bed early each night. Their toys and play area tended to colonize space so it made sense for the master bedroom to become the nursery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Casey and Kumar also focused on optimizing the living space. It needed to feel as open as possible, preserve natural light, and allow typically distinct spaces to share square footage and core functions. The designers posted their project on Sweeten. They were introduced to a Sweeten general contractor who helped bring the couple’s collaborative drawings to life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54540 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="648" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54547 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-30.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The biggest challenge, having assigned the only bedroom to their children, was locating their own. They designed a multipurpose room of custom millwork containing a pull-down bed. A surround of retracting walls allowed them to swap sleep space for play and work space as well as an entertaining area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54538 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="660" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54539 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="661" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Integrating the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designers envisioned an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a> as a central part of the main shared space. The prep and cooking utility would transition without making visual disruptions into the dining and living area. They decided to forgo upper cabinets to keep sightlines clear across the space. The millwork, in a striking combination of natural wood and stone materials, dressed up to resemble a piece of furniture. Soapstone countertops and backsplash and slate floor tiles added functionality and a dark tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54534 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The ultimate kitchen pantry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The understated wall of square doors next to it opened an intricate array of pull-out compartments dedicated to specific uses. Before drawing the kitchen cabinets, Casey and Kumar documented the exact storage requirements they needed to accommodate, to guarantee a precise fit. Finally, they situated the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/how-panel-ready-refrigerators-change-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel ready refrigerator</a>, freezer, and pantry just across from the kitchen, as a single integrated design. It also conceals the apartment’s only structural column.</p>
<p>All of this works together to allow the kitchen to be a social space. Or on display as a backdrop to the life of the dining and sitting areas.</p>

<h3>A classic and comfortable bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Casey and Kumar aimed for a general upgrade. It would complement the building’s modernist design origins. They chose classic fixtures with simple shapes and Inca black stone mosaic floor tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54523 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1431" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-210x300.jpg 210w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-600x859.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1475" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-54526" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-600x885.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Modern and historical outcome</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the board, Casey and Kumar wanted to avoid glossing over the history and character of their building with a layer of ‘newness&#8217;. They kept the finishes in line with what was there before. By picking up on material cues from their favorite furnishings, the family was able to infuse many technical design decisions with uncharacteristic and inspiring warmth!</p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Sophia, Manhattan homeowner</span><span id="more-16382"></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For five years, I had been parked in a 400 square foot rent-stabilized apartment at a great location on the Upper West Side. As a single person, I felt like it was spacious. When my husband moved <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1178174334" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in three years</span></span> ago, 400 square feet seemed &#8220;cozy,&#8221; and once I gave birth to our son, Apollo, the space became woefully inadequate. It just could not contain the mountain of stuff that accompanies caring for a baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We entered the Manhattan housing market and had a terrible time for a few months; we made several offers and were outbid on everything. All of the two-bedroom apartments within our price range were such wrecks that with construction costs included, they would have been over budget. Two things we knew for sure: we were determined to stay within our budget and I didn&#8217;t want anything that would need the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it. For the latter, as the saying goes, &#8220;famous last words&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Just when we were about to give up on our search, I decided to go to one last open house for a unit that had been on the market for months. Unbelievably, it was listed at a price that was within our budget and had three bedrooms, even larger than what we were originally hoping to get. It needed some work, but the maintenance was so low that we were convinced even with renovation costs, it would still be within our monthly budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The best part was thanks to an unusual catwalk outside the front door &#8212; the apartment actually received three exposures during the day and thus, a ton of light. But inside, it was similar to a “bento box” with lots of walls separating each of the living spaces and blocking all of that great light. The kitchen was dated and the whole thing needed to be gutted.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16388" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> after hearing from friends who had also found a general contractor on the website. We liked the ability to review candidates’ work online and we were extremely drawn to design-build companies for holistic decisions that would be more likely to contain costs. Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> and I was hooked on their work. I loved the design of their projects and after speaking with their references, we hired them immediately. We were able to get a running start designing the kitchen with Paulina while we were still in the process of closing. As soon as we closed, Paulina&#8217;s group was able to go in and start demolition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16389" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went to see the apartment on the first day of demolition at the end of the day. As we stood there in the quiet dusk with the post-demolition dust slowly settling all around us, we both looked at each other with our mouths open…and in a moment of panic, I wondered if they could just put it all back the way it had been and pretend like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Once the debris cleared and the actual construction began, things were looking up. Bringing the dividing wall down between the kitchen and living room made a tremendous difference. Light poured in through the kitchen and into the hallways.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16393" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" alt="upper west side kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert custom-built the entire kitchen and it looks absolutely fantastic. We opted for classic white custom cabinets and we absolutely love the open shelving that Paulina incorporated per our request. The bookcase that transitions between the living room and kitchen was designed by her, and we love that it is a more natural ending point to the backsplash. Paulina persuaded us that wood countertops would require significant upkeep, so we opted instead for a simple quartz counter that has been great.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We tried to stay within our budget as much as possible and in doing so, decided to keep the perfectly fine (if dated) stove to hopefully be swapped out at a later date. Leon shopped with Paulina to find a narrower and more modern fridge and a new microwave that would match the width of the stove. Leon did the backlighting himself using an electronic LED strip that he controls through his phone. It can wirelessly connect and change colors to reflect the weather or the changes in the stock market. (<em>Editor’s note &#8212; ahem, what?? The stock market!?</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also went with a slightly more modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased our simple matte black pulls and handles from Ikea.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our expert team was always professional during all of our interactions, even the ones when we were definitely playing the demanding and nervous first-time renovator role. I&#8217;m not sure we will ever do anything with the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it again, but this was a great first-time renovating experience and we are so happy in our new home!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s dispatch comes from the interior designer of a New York City apartment re-do. Samantha was brought on to help modernize a client’s apartment, and while she was up for leading the ambitious design needs, she needed help finding a general contractor who could execute beautifully on the plans. Her client had filled his home with art and travel finds over the course of four decades in the space, and what started as a “refresh” project evolved into a total apartment renovation to create a light and bright canvas for treasured pieces and cherished friends. </span></i><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Samantha Stein, Interior Designer</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stars aligned when a good friend put me in touch with a potential client I’d known for years. Ron, the homeowner, had been living in the same Upper East Side post-war apartment for 40 years (!) and was ready for some interior changes to freshen it up. We met to discuss priorities and a design vision, and then turned to Sweeten for help choosing a contractor for </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4273" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were able to use Sweeten’s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">network to narrow our contractor choice down to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one firm</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was experienced and great to work with. They had a reasonable price for our initial wish list, and after we began working with them, we grew more comfortable expanding into more custom solutions and additional scope, for what would ultimately become a full gut renovation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the theme of the renovation was a relatively minimal ‘refresh’ &#8211; new paint, strip and refinish floors, clean-up details such as the custom five inches of crown molding in the living room, add custom millwork covers for the old and dilapidated radiator units, and complete a full renovation of the very outdated kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18494 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18493" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron, the client, wavered back and forth about updating his traditional apartment into a more modern space with an open-concept living and kitchen area. Ultimately, however, his classical taste and the way he uses the apartment in his daily life led us to leaving an enclosed kitchen, but updating its finishes and changing a few details to make the whole living area feel larger and flow more seamlessly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We removed both doors to the kitchen in favor of open entryways, demolished the two china cabinets that were edging into the dining space, and intended to continue the existing parquet into the kitchen. But, the more we discussed matching the existing parquet in rooms that had either outdated carpeting or badly damaged linoleum, the trickier it seemed it would be to get the clean, flowing feeling that Ron was looking for. After weighing costs and options with George&#8217;s team, we decided that going with a wide-plank engineered wood throughout the entire apartment (with the direction of the planks leading your eye out to the living room windows) was the right solution for a cohesive, flowing apartment. Ripping out the parquet allowed us to fully level and soundproof the subfloor, as well as fully waterproof the kitchen area. Great sighs of relief went up all around when the 40+ year old parquet and carpeting pieces were hauled out, and the textured wood floors (supplied by Glen Floors) look fantastic. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron has a fabulous lifelong collection of china, music, and incredible books on art, music, and travel that were hiding around the apartment. So, one of the top priorities for the renovation was storage. Curating a selected display of these items felt to me the best way to celebrate his travels and life experiences – they should be an integral part of the apartment without looking kitschy or messy. I had originally proposed a huge built-in wall of custom shelving and cabinetry, but pricey bids from other contractors made us step back. Once we started with George&#8217;s team, however, we felt confident we could bring back this concept to make up for the lost kitchen/dining storage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We drew inspiration from several interiors that featured shelving surrounding a ‘nook’ for the sofa, and Michael and Dennis were able to help us flawlessly execute this vision with a stunning custom piece. The weight of the real wood doors, soft-close hinges, adjustable shelving, and hardware we selected from Nassau Suffolk Hardware make it all fit in perfectly—it’s hard to believe it wasn’t there before. We added two brass sconces from Ralph Lauren Home to softly light the sofa area at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18497 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="dark wood floors" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> </span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="traditional dining table" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was where the majority of the hard work happened. Our expert team was able to match my every demand. We re-centered the sink on the windows, removed a dropped ceiling section just above the windows, and gained upper cabinets by replacing the double wall ovens with a more conventional range. We saved a ton on appliances with some lucky timing with a big sale at Thermador, and chose a refrigerator, gas range, recirculating hood, and dishwasher from their Professional Series line. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom cabinets, again made from real wood, fit perfectly and are of incredible quality. We ordered the Kohler sink from Wayfair and the Rohl faucet from Nassau Suffolk Hardware. Our experts helped us choose Caesarstone quartz countertops instead of a pricier granite or marble, and we are impressed with their quality. Under-cabinet lighting and a few LEDs above the sink, in addition to the overhead fixture, make for lots of different ways to light the kitchen at night. The kitchen alone makes the entire apartment feel new and fresh, and its traditional accents (crown molding and the custom bevel on the countertops) keep it in the same design family as the rest of the apartment. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom and living room, we carefully selected vintage rugs to soften the newly wood-clad floors. Custom millwork radiator covers with picture-frame molding and Caesarstone tops replaced falling-apart metal enclosures for the A/C and heaters under the windows. Each has a powder-coated metal grill inset into the top and they act as gorgeous shelves to display a few more curios. These new units alone make the apartment look so much better! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael and Dennis also helped us outfit each of the seven closets in the apartment with custom shelving, so that we could reorganize all of Ron’s belongings to make more sense for his daily use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18504 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="custom radiator millwork covers" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18505" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="traditional bedroom aesthetic" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were so happy with their work that toward the end of the project, we even decided to hit on a long term wish list item for Ron: a deep-soaking tub in the master bath, and brand new shower and sink hardware (all from Rohl through Gracious Homes) in both bathrooms!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="rohl shower faucets" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18508" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="large format white shower tiles" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the full renovation took a lot of hard work, energy, and time. Ron loves showing off his new space and everyone is thrilled with the results. We’re grateful to the team at Sweeten for matching us with George and his crew, who were dependable and creative. They were flexible enough to work with us to incorporate lots of changes on the fly, and helped make our initial fantasy vision into a tangible reality.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re back on Manhattan’s Upper West Side to tour the rest of Sophia, Leon, and Apollo’s delightful home. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia gave us the inside intel on the family’s kitchen renovation</a> and now we’re on to a double bathroom renovation plus a few smart closet additions. Read on for a study of unfussy materials, savvy IKEA picks, and a great general contractor pair who brought it all together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/sophia-bathroom-renovation-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-16536 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-bathroom.jpg" alt="modern bathroom renovation uws" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-bathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-16525"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sophia and Leon were clear-eyed about the amount of work needed in their new home. The apartment’s full bath cleaned up ok but fixtures were mismatched and poorly installed and the sink and medicine cabinet were not built to last. The half bath was in rougher shape &#8211; institutional tiles and stained grout left the room with a dank feel. The family’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a> was mainly focused on the kitchen but the project naturally evolved as Sophia and Leon met with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten experts Paulina and Albert</a> and came up with a plan to gut both bathrooms.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina’s design credentials and Albert’s millwork specialty played a big role in all aspects of this renovation. In the full bath, Paulina helped Sophia find practical materials and clean finishes, anchoring the floor with a matte black hex tile and lining the shower with elongated modern white subway tiles and gray grout. Sophia chose a warm wood-finish, deep storage sink vanity from IKEA, which Albert modified to fit the room’s plumbing.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the half bath, the absence of a shower allowed the team to yank wall tile altogether and keep the focus on a lovely mosaic floor. And because the family’s use of the half bath is more limited, they skipped under-sink storage and chose a minimalist pedestal sink to keep floor space open in the small room.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The team worked to make the most of closet space throughout the rest of the apartment and were able to integrate IKEA’s PAX sliding doors with custom internal closet framing. White trim, matte black doorknobs, and black pendant lighting throughout the newly open living areas unified the rest of the apartment, creating a clean and simple look that is effortlessly stylish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>This week’s guest author offers an architect’s eye on an ambitious Upper East Side kitchen renovation.

<i>Guest post by Steve Townsend, Manhattan architect and homeowner </i><br />
<span id="more-16257"></span><br />
When I moved in with my girlfriend, Lauren, to our one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side, it was clear that the kitchen had suffered from some serious neglect. The apartment has been in her family for decades, with her parents purchasing it several years ago from her grandparents as an investment property. It has been an eternal revolving door of short-term family tenants. I am an architect and she works in television advertising, but it was apparent to both of us that the outdated design needed a remedy. Renovating the apartment was always an end goal, but having an architect in the relationship accelerated those plans, because: free obligated labor!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design problems with the kitchen were immediately apparent. The building was constructed in the 1970s, and apart from the finishes and appliances not being replaced throughout its lifetime, the layout harkened back to a simpler time – when nobody wanted to see their kitchens and apparently there was never more than one person in the kitchen at a time. It was remarkably small and completely enclosed—an ‘L’ shape configuration with a door at each end—with very limited counter and storage space. The walls ensured that no natural light made its way in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not typically on the client side of construction projects like this – typically the client handles finding and hiring the contractor, and as architects, we then work with whoever is contracted. Moreover, we typically engage in larger scale projects in New York and abroad, so our local network of contractors is limited. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> provided an instant network of screened contractors, who specialize in this scale and scope of project, and lined up a series of contractors who were both interested and qualified.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16284" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Steven_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Because the design was finalized (rendering above) when we reached out to prospective contractors, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we were very clear with the plan</a>, we just needed someone who would complement our vision and desires. After meeting with Sweeten’s recommendations, we decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>. His team specializes in renovations like ours, and his aesthetic was remarkably aligned with our own.</p>
<p>The objectives of the design were simple: open up the whole space, maximize counter space without sacrificing storage, and obviously replace all appliances and cabinets. The new cabinets and finishes needed to be durable and the layout functional for two passionate chefs. The plan became pretty clear: blow out the walls and consolidate the appliances to the back walls.</p>
<p>We kept the existing ‘L’ configuration, but enlarged it by demolishing all of the partitions and replacing them with a large island. The island instantly doubled our counter space while adding all the below-counter storage. Because we enjoy hosting dinners and making cooking more of a communal experience, we opted for a two-tiered island with a counter-height side at the kitchen and a bar-height side facing the rest of the apartment. And since we eliminated two closets as part of the demolition, we included full height cabinets and shelves on the wall outside of the kitchen to serve as storage and a pantry closet, without intruding too far into the space.</p>

<p>These changes gave us vast spatial improvement to the apartment and made room for a complete update of all the appliances. We knew we wanted professional-grade appliances and we let these choices serve as the foundation of many design decisions. In order to get the feeling of a commercial kitchen, the appliances are stainless steel, which go well with the rest of the space. We opted for a large <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluestar</a> 6-burner range, which is really the centerpiece of the new equipment, as well as a Fridgidaire fridge and a KitchenAid dishwasher.</p>
<p>In order to accentuate the openness and lightness of the new design, we decided to go with all-white finishes for all the vertical surfaces – custom white lacquered cabinets and white subway tile for the backsplash and other walls. In order to contrast the white surfaces, we decided on a dark gray Caesarstone counter and a ceramic floor tile in a similar hue.</p>

<p>Kris&#8217;s experience in this kind of work was invaluable throughout the process, and when minor hiccups occurred – as they invariably do in these types of projects – his creativity and expertise always led to innovative solutions. The end result is a really fantastic change from the original apartment. Aside from now having a better functioning and more practical layout for a kitchen, the whole apartment is brighter and more open.</p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Samina, Manhattan homeowner</span><br />
<span id="more-15403"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After twelve years of living in a Union Square loft with unsealed and stained windows that wouldn&#8217;t open (and following a year-long process of dealing with Landmarks Commission permits for work in a 19th century building), we were finally at installation week for new windows in our apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare, we had to have some interior shelving removed and a bit of wall board was damaged in the process. I made a split-second decision to remove the wall surrounding the windows because there had been some troubling leaks in the past, and I wanted to make sure that the quality of the wall matched the quality of the new windows. Little did I know that what I would discover in the next few hours would kick off a nearly three-year exterior building wall remediation project, for which we had no more than a thin sheet of copper separating us from the outside. Needless to say, those were some cold winters…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15404" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15406" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After this huge setback in 2012, we managed to get our new windows up in 2014 and we were given the go-ahead by the building to finally rebuild our interior wall in 2015. As a licensed architect, I understood the technical side of the work, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I still needed a contractor</a> who would be detail-oriented enough to follow my drawings and work with me on issues that arose during the construction. I reached out to my professional network but the demand for high-quality contractors made it difficult for me to engage someone on my small project. In my web searching, I came upon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. I was reassured by conversations with Sweeten’s team, who, after listening to the particularities of my project, suggested a couple of matches. My husband was the first to meet Sweeten Expert Nick while I out was out of town, and he was impressed with Nick&#8217;s positive reaction to my detailed drawings. When I then met Nick, it was immediately clear that we had a great rapport. He quickly identified the most critical elements of the project. I was surprised at how Nick appreciated my drawings and welcomed that level of detail. Many contractors want to change how drawings are done to suit their own needs, but Nick ensured that the details were covered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to achieve a clean and refined but also warm aesthetic that would complement and add to the exposed brick of our loft walls. I was also determined to insulate the wall properly and create a continuous air barrier that would reduce thermal transmission. In addition, we needed to repair a broken radiator and pipes that had exploded during the previous winter when the wall had been exposed and un-insulated, and we needed to incorporate new electric wiring and re-mount automated shades that we’d installed before but were now disconnected.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15410" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Architecturally, there were many different “planes” to resolve: the wall’s center bay extended beyond the side windows and the sills of the side bays were higher than the center bay. Plus, the old wood windows had dictated the placement of our new aluminum windows, so we had some issues with straight lines, and the center window has a “tilt and turn” feature with a very slim frame – not a lot of wiggle room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While work was underway, Nick alerted me whenever there was a tricky issue to resolve. For example, he discovered that one of the side windows was actually an inch and a half higher than the other window and he also pointed out a spot where my drawings of how to bury a pipe were a little optimistic. We were able to work together through a cycle of conversations and quick sketches, and he also was able to reach out to his network within the same day when my own plumbing contractor fell through. He and his team were extremely meticulous in their workmanship as well as in their maintenance of the work site day to day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wall is nothing short of amazing to me. It looks like it was always meant to be that way. The radiator installation fits so nicely, and the windows are finished off with red oak trim and sills that are seamless and beautiful. The shades are hidden nicely behind matching red oak valances. The wall&#8217;s performance is even more incredible than the aesthetics. It is now so quiet in the apartment that you would never know that there is a busy New York street of shops, restaurants, and bars below. We were very happy in the end to create a warm, modern facade that highlights the views offered by our new nine-foot windows.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Brighten a galley kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>:  Anne, a <a href="https://www.studioparapluie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fashion illustrator</a>, bought her apartment in Brooklyn Heights over a decade ago and always knew she wanted to renovate the kitchen. The years went by and she &#8220;remained paralyzed at the prospect of finding a contractor and spending the money on such a large project.&#8221; She finally decided to treat herself to a complete renovation of the kitchen to make it more functional and beautiful. The tiny space (it was just 27 square feet!) had little light and was not enjoyable to cook in. She figured a wall between the kitchen and living space would have to come down. After interviewing a couple of firms that had been referred to her for the job that weren&#8217;t the right fit, she<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3801" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> posted her project </a>to Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="anne-on-chair-after-renovation" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40300" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" alt="anne sitting on chair infront of cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="727" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Portrait-300x218.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Portrait-600x436.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15086 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Before-01" width="1000" height="1347" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-Before-01-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15085" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-During.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-During" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-During.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_Anne_Kitchen-During-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Her Sweeten general contractor came up with a plan that offered practical solutions to reimagining her too-tight kitchen—including knocking down the wall between her kitchen and living room. They waited weeks for permits from the NYC Department of Buildings to remove the wall but finally got the approval to start demolition.</p>
<p>A peninsula replaced the wall, providing more storage and a space for entertaining. On the living room side, it hosts plenty of shelves and bookcases, perfect for Anne&#8217;s art supplies and book collection. There&#8217;s even a hidden outlet for a printer inside one of the cabinets and LED lighting underneath the unit too.  &#8220;The amount of storage that my contractor was able to include in the design–including shelving on the side for my cookbooks and a small wine rack—is truly miraculous,&#8221; Anne exclaimed.</p>

Instead of opting for the popular choice of white marble, Anne decided on a black marble countertop for most of the cook space. A hand-crafted maple wood countertop on the peninsula brings warmth, while brushed brass hardware and glass upper cabinet doors help set her desired tone of sophistication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It feels as if I have moved into a brand new, luxury apartment! The abundance of light and the new functionality of this kitchen design have made me a very happy chef, and I am looking forward to making many hearty meals this winter from my favorite cookbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Paris-Kitchen-Recipes-Stories/dp/1607742675" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>My Paris Kitchen</i> by David Lebovitz</a>,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<span class="img-label">Guest post by Lisa, Upper East Side homeowner</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, after renting in the Village for 20 years, I bought a small one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. The apartment is on a high floor, bright and sunny, and except for the kitchen, in perfect condition. The teeny tiny kitchen was dated and shabby with sagging cabinets, cracked tile, bulky appliances, and a huge mystery stain on the ugly laminate countertop<span id="more-14621"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I had no experience planning a renovation, I decided to live with the kitchen and figure out exactly what worked and what didn’t. As soon as I unpacked, one problem became apparent… the builder-grade cabinets were too shallow for serving dishes and cookware and I had to store my pots and pans in my coat closet. The lower drawers and cabinets were so narrow they were almost useless. The kitchen sink was far too shallow and there was limited counter space with only one electrical outlet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14626" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-150x150.jpg 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-05-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14624" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-Before-03-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With these issues in mind, I started my research.  My dream kitchen had beautiful wooden cabinetry with sleek appliances and marble counters, but as I evaluated the actual space I had to work with (and my budget), I decided that a clean minimal style would work best in the boxy little space. Once I figured out what I was looking for, I started canvassing my friends for contractor recommendations. The horror stories scared me enough to postpone my plans for a month or so, until one by one, my appliances started dying. The stove burners led the way, followed in rapid succession by the microwave and dishwasher. When the refrigerator started making a grinding noise, I knew I couldn’t procrastinate any longer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, I read about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> on Apartment Therapy and it sounded like exactly what I needed. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a> and quickly got an email from Sweeten helping me determine that because I knew pretty much what I was looking for and wasn’t making drastic structural changes, I could reasonably go with a good contractor and forgo hiring (and paying for) a designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I got in touch with four contractors referred by Sweeten and ultimately selected <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Erion</a>. He wasn’t discouraged by the size of the kitchen, understood what I was looking for, had great taste, and showed an eye for details. As a newbie, I also really appreciated that he was very clear about costs, estimating to me what materials and labor were expected to cost for each item instead of just giving me a lump price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14632" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14629" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Lisa_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I sent Erion photos of minimalist-style kitchens I liked and gave him my list of complaints about the current kitchen. From that point on, he took over. He handled everything. He recommended that we go with semi-custom cabinets in order to get the depth I wanted, and showed me samples for countertops and hardware, first editing options down to two or three initial choices, with more available if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Erion’s samples, I went with white high-gloss upper cabinets and gray high-gloss lower cabinets with bar pull hardware. The countertop is <a href="https://www.daltile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daltile’s One Quartz</a> in Luminesce, which is a bright white that went nicely with the cabinets and backsplash and needs almost no upkeep. For the backsplash, I went with <a href="https://www.marazziusa.com/our-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marazzi Sistem C</a> Bianco, similar to subway tile but with an interesting size. In order to add a little visual interest, we used three rows of Daltile Fashion Accents in nickel blend. The floor is tiled in Marazzi Soho Anthracite because, well, just because I love the look of a slate floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to maximize the little space I have, I chose a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/products/dishwashers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch 18-inch dishwasher</a> and a <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel 25-inch counter-depth refrigerator</a>. The range and microwave are both <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a>, chosen mostly for the sleek lines and reliable reputation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The end result is both beautiful and functional, and was on time and on budget!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re in Ditmas Park this week for an extra fun assignment! Usually, we chronicle all of the shiny new things in a New York City renovation. This week, the challenge is to figure out what stayed put in a family&#8217;s kitchen and closet upgrade. One quick look at the before and afters here might leave you thinking that this was a classic gut renovation, but a closer study reveals a more surgical project with a lot of smart design compromises that let a Ditmas Park family keep what was working and fit in a lot of extra storage and style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/before-after-kensington-kitchen-and-closets-sweetened"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14932 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png" alt="closet renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nikkiakitchenclosetv4-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14921"></span>Nikkia and Daniel moved into their 850 square foot two-bedroom apartment feeling grateful that the previous owners had taken care of restoring hardwood floors and putting a coat of fresh paint throughout the place. The kitchen had new cabinets and appliances, but the dark finish and heavy trim obscured the room&#8217;s natural light and the layout made key storage space inaccessible and inefficiently used. The kitchen lacked a backsplash in its high traffic stove and sink area and the previous owners had skipped on cabinetry in the windowed corner, opting for slim open storage instead. In the bedroom, two narrow adjacent closets were no match for two sets of clothes and shoes, ceding precious storage space to an unnecessary dividing wall. The family&#8217;s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3953" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten project post</a> called for giving the kitchen a more modern, light and open feel without making major architectural or construction changes and combining the two small bedroom closets into one large closet with smarter organization options. We thought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> would be a great fit for the clever work that would be needed to make both spots work harder for this family.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sweeten contractor and his team started in the kitchen with a few targeted plans: they removed the traditional molding that added heft to the upper line of cabinets, gave the cabinets a new coat of <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-color/oc-117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore &#8220;Simply White&#8221; paint</a> inside and out, and swapped in more modern and sturdy hardware to complement the Shaker-style cabinet lines. They also added classic white subway tiles from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a> to wrap around the stove and sink prep space, protecting the newly white walls from cooking collateral and replaced the original sink with a sleeker, deeper, and more durable under-mount. The team replaced laminate counters in two spots with a new contemporary gray quartz and installed a more flexible Grohe single-handle sink faucet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most significant upgrade is also in some ways the most unassuming: out with the limited shelving and storage cart that never quite fit in the corner by the window, and in went expertly matched new cabinetry and counters to mimic the materials now in place on the other two sides of the kitchen. Deep <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a> drawer storage puts cookware within a few feet of the stove and a translucent upper cabinet displays glass and barware. The new section of countertop doubles as a mini eat-in kitchen nook with its extra overhang. Appliances and original cabinetry and floor tiles all stayed put, saving thousands of dollars and keeping the project on a much tighter timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the contractor took on two tiny closets with side-by-side doors and a single row of hanging rod space, freeing up un-used space in between and adding simple improvements to every inch. Double hanging rods, open shelving, drawer storage, bright all-white materials, and interior lighting now house a wide range of wardrobe necessities with dedicated spaces for bags, shoes, a hamper, and folded clothes. The contractor re-did the door molding and hardware to make the addition look seamless and matched a new set of extra-tall 96&#8243; swing doors, minus the builder-grade insets from the previous set, for a more modern look.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When a design editor and curator came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate the kitchen and bathroom in her 1910 Greenwich Village industrial loft, we were psyched to see what she would do with the remnants of a 1970s condo conversion and eager to see how a design professional would (presumably) breeze through her own renovation. We most definitely did end up with a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom after we introduced this homeowner to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Aleks</a>, but we also landed some especially insightful lessons learned along the way. We&#8217;ll keep our source secret because she works in the industry, but here are three renovation lessons from a sweetened kitchen and bathroom that everyone should know.</p>
<p><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/3-renovation-lessons-learned-from-a-greenwich-village-designer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14579" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg" alt="kitchen and bath renovation " width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14565"></span></p>
<h3>1. Visit the showrooms, but buy online.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insider tip from this renovation is that you have to combine high-tech and low-tech research methods to make decisions and purchases. Products are endlessly available from a huge variety of sources and it&#8217;s worth visiting showrooms and stone yards to see and touch the materials that will be in your home for years, but the best prices for most materials can be found online. Even with architect and designer discounts, this design pro found that most purchases were cheaper online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One potential downside of skipping the brick and mortar ordering experience is that you are dealing with a wide variety of sources across many appliances and fixtures. The word from our insider is to apply some good old-fashioned patience and diligence in dealing with different customer service contacts, but also take very clear pictures of labels and serial numbers and specs in case you need to correct an order or source any additional tiny parts. Keep your cool as materials arrive by cataloguing electronic records and photos of all of the pieces, with serial numbers visible in your photos, so that you can instantly source what you need as deliveries fall into place. These records will also help you document any problems you do run into with vendors and will give you a much clearer path to resolving issues big and small.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Learn your way around IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our industry source looked at lots of kitchen cabinetry options and found that the high-end route was astronomically expense. Frustratingly, the next tier down was slightly more budget-friendly, but not enough to mask the difference in construction quality. IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system required admittedly time-consuming weeknight trips and weekend excursions, but investing time and learning her way around their design software yielded a great set of cabinets and a modern look at a much lower price point. &#8220;Brace yourself and crack IKEA&#8221; in her words!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any order, you should have your contractor confirm measurements and weigh in on the pieces you pick before you order. Your contractor is your full partner in the renovation &#8211; even if you have the patience to teach yourself to use IKEA&#8217;s design system, your contractor will figure out ways to make things work and help you pass obstacles you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see coming.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stay close by and check in often.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re going with a major renovation and need to stay elsewhere while the work is underway, it&#8217;s really important to be close by and check in often. Even with all of the advance planning and ordering and designing that goes in to the process, there are decisions being made on the ground at every stage and you want to be a part of it. It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re supervising the work or preventing mistakes, it&#8217;s that there are small decisions and many paths that the team will go down, and you can have an impact as design translates into build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talk to your contractor about when visits make sense and be a regular thought partner in the progress. Our insider also encouraged renovators to be kind to themselves and to their contractors: be prepared for mistakes &#8211; the wrong color, the wrong size, and unforeseen adjustments are an inevitable part of a complex and custom process. Forgive yourself and build in the emotional and scheduling contingencies to address mistakes and keep moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we have a full bathroom renovation guest report in from Celeste G., a condo owner and marketing, brand building, and copywriting triple threat in Park Slope. Read on down for Celeste’s debrief on her Brooklyn bathroom before and after!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14659 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg" alt="celeste park slope bathroom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/celestebathroom2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Homeowner guest post by Celeste G., Park Slope homeowner<span id="more-14416"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased my one bedroom condo in Park Slope in 2008. It was new construction, which was great because I am the exact opposite of handy or DIY. The “design” of the apartment was standard for new construction buildings at the time: bamboo floors, limestone tile, and dark cherry cabinetry. I lived in the apartment for a few years before considering any cosmetic changes and around year three, I noticed that the limestone tiles in my bathroom had darkened in some spots. In fact, the tile had never been sealed and as I learned the hard way, limestone is extremely porous. Several failed cleaning experiments later, I had nearly ruined the color and texture of a small patch near the sink vanity. As a clean enthusiast, the sight of the floor drove me bananas, but I wasn’t ready to take on what felt like an overwhelming renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-01" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I decided to replace all the bamboo floors in my apartment (why start small when practically moving out of your home is an option?!). Luckily this foray into renovation was successful and the change in flooring literally changed the entire look and feel of the whole place. I felt confident tackling my tiny bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did some research on what I might spend (why are toilets so expensive???) and asked my friends for contractor recommendations. My building required contractors with a certain amount of insurance, so I started looking beyond friend recommendations and luckily landed on Sweeten. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a> and was matched with three contractors including <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>. All I knew for sure was that I liked the idea of a gray/black/white graphical floor, and I definitely needed more storage space because clutter makes my eyes swim &#8212; during our first meeting, I felt that Paulina understood the general aesthetic I was interested in and suggested a number of possibilities to open up the small-ish space. I sent her a few pictures from Pinterest and she developed 3D models based on my bathroom’s measurements. For someone spatially challenged, the modeling was enormously helpful. I could see the transformation and make adjustments before touching a thing. For example, we initially thought gold hardware would elevate the bathroom’s overall look but once I saw it in the model, I opted to go with chrome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we were decided on the 3D model, Paulina sourced floor and wall samples and sent me a photo of the type of wood planned for a custom vanity. I presented a lot of options to her and relied on her expertise for guidance. For example, a friend of mine replaced her bathroom sinks with <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corian surfaces</a> and I really liked the seamlessness of it. I shared a photo with Paulina and she designed the sink and vanity with a beautiful, white Corian top, complete with side cutouts to add some dimension and visual interest. Honestly, I was unsure about the cutouts initially but after seeing it in the 3D model, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14447" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-01" width="600" height="890" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14448" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main challenge with this bathroom was the lack of storage space. I asked Paulina for a deep medicine cabinet along with a good amount of storage space in the vanity. I got my wish in spades. As we were discussing options, I pointed out that there was no place for a trash bin. Paulina worked it into the design of the vanity so not only do I have space for a small trash bin, it’s also completely hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original inspiration for the renovation was again, the floor. I fell in love with a cement tile in a M.C. Escher-like pattern. Paulina ordered samples for us to review but expressed some second thoughts about the durability and appearance of that tile. Maybe two or three days later, she emailed me to say that she was concerned about this particular pick and suggested I look at some marble tile with a similar pattern at a showroom nearby. I’m so glad I took her up on it. The marble option, from <a href="https://www.walkerzanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker Zanger</a> (in Facet Ash), was not only more in line with the aesthetic I wanted but also less expensive and more durable. I kept my original tub and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Bathroom-Toilets/category/429984/429204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, and framed the room in a new beveled, white subway tile. I kept the walls white and Paulina’s team installed a <a href="https://www.minkagroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minka-Lavery Downtown Edison lighting fixture</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14449" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two weeks of actual renovation are a blur to me now. They seemed to go by very quickly and yet take forever. I was close enough to check on progress every day and Paulina’s team really did work fast. The transformation was fun to watch, even though I admittedly had a few panicked moments and doubts about the chair rail tile (why do I even know what this is?) and the vanity. I remember one email I sent Paulina after the vanity was installed. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes in the bathroom while it was still under construction trying to get the drawers to the vanity open, and then emailed to ask if the drawers would be easier to open when the bathroom was finished. It didn’t occur to me that the pulls hadn’t been installed yet. Thankfully, Paulina has a good sense of humor…!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months later and I still love my new bathroom. When I think back to that stained limestone tile and cherry wood vanity, I can’t believe it took me seven years to switch it up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we’re off to Chelsea to tour an apartment rescued from someone else’s well-intentioned (but ultimately not long-lasting) DIY tile project. Cara, Jared, and their dog, Indy, moved into their one bedroom, one bathroom co-op a few years ago, and though Cara was irked by the kitchen’s layout and finishes from the beginning, the couple arrived at a point of no return last year when the mosaic tile installed by the previous owners started to fall off the wall.</p>
<p><a href=" https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14393 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg" alt="chelsea kitchen reno" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>“Evros was able to come in, be a calming influence at a stressful time, and meet deadlines from our board and our cabinet vendor. He’ll be back to help get our place ready for the arrival of our new baby!”</strong></em><span id="more-14284"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8212; Cara and Jared, Chelsea homeowners</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the bathroom situation was the most dire – tile damage near the tub was more than just a cosmetic concern – the kitchen was also turning out to be too cramped for two cooks. Jared, a professional chef, and Cara, who works for a boutique recruiting firm, decided to press on with targeted changes to make the space more of a fit for them. After a first try with a contractor they found through a friend who wasn’t able to get buy-in from the building’s board, the couple came to Sweeten to find a team who could handle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project</a> and make sure that each “t” and every “i” would be properly crossed and dotted for building approval. We introduced Cara and Jared to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> who gracefully took on both charges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14351 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14472 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara and Jared decided early on to focus a significant chunk of their budget on built-to-order kitchen cabinetry from <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>. They nearly tripled the kitchen’s storage by removing a partial peninsula, lengthening the counter and shelving line way out of the corner, and adding a hefty island with a huge amount of storage and prep space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new white oak cabinetry is beautifully crafted and helped dictate design and finish decisions throughout the room. The couple picked a gray plank base with a white oak line of upper cabinets. Aside from their neutral and contemporary appeal, Cara explained that Henrybuilt offers a mix and match option (high-pressure laminate along the bottom and solid wood on top) that gave them the effect of high-end cabinetry without quite having to shoulder the full cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other key design decision involved moving the stove out of the back of the room and centering it – better for hosting and better for access to the dining area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros’s team anchored the expanded kitchen footprint with porcelain tiles from <a href="https://www.porcelanosa-usa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcelanosa</a> and installed <a href="https://pentalquartz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentalquartz</a> counters all they way around the new line of base cabinets. Cara artfully explained that her talented husband has some, well… bull-in-china-shop tendencies when he is at work on a new culinary treat, and so their sole consideration in choosing a new counter was durability and stain resistance! The “bar block” that tops the island is a Henrybuilt signature – Cara and Jared love the accessible storage option and layered it with glass to make it easier to use in a high-traffic entryway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara chose the neutral white backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a> for its modern simplicity and understated effect. Finishing strong with appliances, Cara and Jared headed for a big, beautiful 36” <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> concealed with a custom door panel, and a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung fridge</a> that hides Cara’s most favorite new feature: a built-in <a href="https://sodastream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SodaStream</a> faucet (this exists?!).</p>

<p>In the bathroom, Evros and his team took on a surgical task to take the old tub out, create a walk-in shower, and replace the crumbling tile that had served as the impetus for the entire project. Cara and Jared decided to leave as much intact as possible and work with what they had, so Evros made sure that the transition from the gleaming new shower to the rest of the room came off seamlessly. Everyone agreed to just do what was needed to make the necessary fixes and restore balance to the room’s function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re back in the Clinton Hill Co-ops to admire another apartment that shed its walls to reveal a spacious layout, oversize windows, and light-filled open plan. Word is definitely getting out: if you can see beyond the cramped and divided interiors of so many of the units in these 1940s-era Brooklyn towers and get in there with a major renovation, you can end up with more square feet (and style) than you can find almost anywhere else in NYC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14257 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14236"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario, who works in media, and Joe, who works in healthcare, bought their 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom co-op in 2013, and spent a year hashing out a game plan for the bathroom. It felt old and small and cramped; out of sync with the style they had going elsewhere in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a project on Sweeten</a> to gut renovate the bathroom and kitchen, and we introduced the pair to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Jon</a>, head of a veteran design-build team based in Park Slope. While the bathroom was the main motivation for renovating, Joe had big plans for the apartment’s dark stained parquet floors, and the couple started to envision a kitchen renovation that would get rid of all of the little compartmentalized spaces and doors separating the kitchen, dining, and living rooms. Let’s focus first on the bathroom upgrade &#8212; we’ll be back soon with a full photo spread of the rest of this gorgeous place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14246" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-05" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-05-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14245" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-04" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-04-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe headed to <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann Sacks</a> for sleek, large tiles that wouldn’t require lots of cleaning or have tricky little crevices. They found a gorgeous striated, gray porcelain tile that almost suggests the feel of coarse denim – it glitters just a little bit behind its tough exterior. They covered the floor in these tiles and continued up the bathroom’s vanity wall, splitting the bathroom with a racing stripe between white walls. In the shower, they went with the same gray tile but in a small cube version (to reduce slickness on the shower floor), and they chose a modern narrow, white porcelain tile for the shower walls. Sweeten Expert Jon accented the shower storage niches with extra slices of gray floor tile and replaced the old tub with a sleek walk-in shower.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14242" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt-03" width="600" height="874" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-03-206x300.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe picked a streamlined <a href="https://ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40281102#/80226199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> with a stained oak-effect finish and worked with Jon to top that storage set with a squared <a href="https://www.build.com/kraus-kcv-121-so-bathroom-sink/s575621" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kraus sink</a> and a <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone countertop</a> that extends across the wall. They also found a contemporary wall-mount faucet to keep the counter clear – the combination of the gray tile and built-in vanity features makes this all look custom! Mario and Joe upgraded from the previously teeny medicine cabinet with a recessed, mirrored cabinet that aligns perfectly with the silhouette of the vanity and found a very cool and current lighting fixture from <a href="https://www.lightingdirect.com/access-lighting-31022-sierra-2-light-bath-bar/p1589105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighting Direct</a> that completes the ensemble. With brushed nickel shower fixtures from Danze (via <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/danze-d510544t-pressure-balanced-shower-trim-package-with-single-function-rain-shower-head-from-the-sirius-collection-less-valve/p2201924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faucet Direct</a>) and a slim <a href="https://www.build.com/toto-cst794ef-toilet/s459773?uid=144073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toto toilet</a>, this new bathroom is equal parts minimal and decorative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14244" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt-05" width="600" height="388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-05.jpg 555w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_MarioApt-05-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so excited to see this first peek into another Clinton Hill Co-op renovation. Thank you, Mario and Joe, for welcoming us in. Looking forward to seeing all the fun that came after this updo!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Previous Sweeten renovators return for finishing touches: a fresh kitchen, living room, master bedroom</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg" alt="clinton hill coops" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario, who works in media, and Joe, who works in healthcare, bought their one-bedroom co-op in 2013 and spent a year learning their way around its many nooks and crannies. The original space had lots of doors and walls that kept the kitchen and pantry closed off from the living and dining rooms, blocking windows and hiding just how much square footage was actually in play. Mario geared up for a full renovation that would bring walls down and open the space up, and Joe plotted the demise of the apartment’s dark parquet floors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> to execute on their vision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14486" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14485" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting in the kitchen, their contractor demo&#8217;ed walls to let light in from this apartment’s signature corner windows. They couldn’t move a structural column so it became the visual marker for the new kitchen’s expanded lines. Maybe surprisingly, they brought down the kitchen ceiling a few inches to make room for recessed lighting and to demarcate the newly open spaces – raising the ceiling seems to be the goal in many renovations, but you can see where a few inches of lost height made complete sense here. Mario and Joe chose <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA’s now-classic white lacquer cabinetry</a> and sourced contemporary cabinet pulls from <a href="https://cabinetparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetparts.com</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14495" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14494" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor helped design the new kitchen island to allow access from both sides. The island is unusually large and far from the kitchen wall, but with drawers on both sides (plus a <a href="https://www.goedekers.com/Summit-CL24WC2.html?utm_source=Amazon&amp;utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_campaign=CL24WC2&amp;zmam=34103103&amp;zmas=2&amp;zmac=231&amp;zmap=Summit-CL24WC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summit wine fridge</a>), it manages to be kitchen-focused on one end with a great work-space option on the other. Mario and Joe decided to keep all of the appliances in a row along the kitchen’s back wall with an all-star line-up that includes a <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/MAS304GASXE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a stainless steel <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/productslist/home-appliances/SHX65T55UC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a>, and a slim <a href="https://www.us-appliance.com/rf135bdlux1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a> with bottom freezer. The backsplash was an admitted splurge – Mario and Joe fell for an <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Sacks tile</a> with an architectural feel and a subtle matte finish. From the living room it disappears, but in the kitchen, the raised detail is super gorgeous.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Mario and Joe replaced dark parquet tiles with wide-plank, 7 1/2“ matte-finished oak floors. They chose the starkest white wall color they could find to keep the main space modern (they actually chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=linenwhite&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore’s Linen White</a>, which has a very white feel in their place despite a name that suggests creamy undertones). The contractor updated baseboard molding with square trim, added low-rise built-in <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/living-room-storage-system-29882/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> as a media center in the living room, stacked floating shelves in the master bedroom, and brought in extra help to overhaul the apartment’s big closets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s style sensibility works so well in the new layout. Somehow, they appear to have already owned most of the art and furniture pieces that look tailor-made in here. Mario explained that the trick was in figuring out where to place furniture and art after walls came down and left fewer surfaces for hanging pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A decor round-up is in order: the kitchen counter stools, couch, and coffee table are all from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>, the dining table is from <a href="https://www.cb2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CB2</a>, and the geometric red rug is a <a href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crate &amp; Barrel</a> pick. Sadly, the cowhide rug was a wanderlust find in Chile and the retro print hanging above the bed is from a DC market, so you can’t have either, but there is a lot here that anyone could work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in case you missed it, the couple also gutted their bathroom.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello again from Crown Heights! We were treated to a summer tour of Colin and Orli&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/colin-and-orlis-sweetened-crown-heights-work-studio-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super creative work studio</a> and we&#8217;re back this week for a full look at the new bathroom, kitchen, and living room in their two bedroom co-op. This scenic and costume designer pair is no stranger to creating transporting spaces and pieces for the theater, but they needed heavy duty help to deal with five layers of rotting floor tiles in the bathroom and fire damage hidden behind the kitchen walls. We dispatched a Sweeten expert for huge overhauls in both rooms and for custom replica and restoration work throughout the apartment, and we were so intrigued by the possibilities in this unique space that we took identical sets of before, during, and after photos that reveal how much work went into re-creating this home. Read on through for the full story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="diningroom-hardwood-floors-kitchen-with-walnut-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47788 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg" alt="photo of dining room with hardwood floors and crown molding and trims and another photo of kitchen with black granite countertop and walnut cabinets and tile floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14162"></span>Colin and Orli knew they had a major project on their hands before closing on the place. The most significant demolition was needed in the bathroom, which had accumulated five different layers of floor tiles, all glued down over each other through multiple renovation attempts spanning decades. The extra floor heft was especially obvious when you stepped down into the tub &#8211; the unexpected drop was enough to catch a visitor off guard. Water damage and rotting materials extended throughout the room and down through the floorboards and joists. Pedro&#8217;s team needed to replace some of the studs, level the joists, and work through plumbing all the way back to the building&#8217;s stacks. In the kitchen, the couple intended to keep the general footprint, but uncovered fire damage from a previous tenant inside the walls. Studs with char marks, several layers of cracked flooring, and non-level sub-flooring required structural work before the fun fixtures and appliances could come anywhere near the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Colin and Orli came up big with two distinctive tile choices in the bathroom. They headed straight for the unfailingly classic and vintage appeal of black and white hex tiles, and picked up a case of each at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/Bathroom_Tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. The path to new wall tile was not quite as direct &#8211; the couple admittedly agonized over finding the right color &#8211; something that would be saturated and bright, luminous and with a hand-painted feel. With a Starbucks-green glaze in mind, they found exactly what they wanted in a ceramic tile at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/ceramic/mcintones_ceramics/ceramic_tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a>. Complete Tile also nailed all of the possible tile configurations, allowing Pedro and his team to work with rounded bullnose, chair rail, and corner tiles all in the same coordinating hues. To save the bathroom from future water damage, they picked up a new tub and fully enclosed it with tile and a sliding glass door. Pedro installed a <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/inspiration-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville</a> vanity topped with granite from <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> and fixtures from <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faucet Direct</a>, where they also found their new eco-flush toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Colin and Orli selected ceramic floor tiles that mimic a slate feel with organic color variation (many tiles in this style have texture or color variation that is digitally printed on top, but not these). They ordered <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville cabinetry</a> from Home Depot in a whiskey black finish, which gives the kitchen a weathered, craftsman feel. They found the cabinet hardware on <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build.com</a>, whose order and return policy made it easy to directly compare more than a dozen finishes. The new countertop has become a deeply loved piece &#8211; at the <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> shop, it was covered in a layer of dust and didn&#8217;t reveal it&#8217;s rich blue, green, and black translucent depth until it arrived for installation. All the appliances are from <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Madison</a>: the stove is a <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Kitchen-Appliances/Ranges/Gas-Range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fridgidaire</a> 5-burner, the fridge is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> with french doors which leave just enough room to swing open in the galley, and the modern sink faucet is <a href="https://www.moen.com/kitchen/sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>. To finish the look, Colin and Orli wrapped the room in an antique silver gloss tin backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.americantinceilings.com/shop-backsplashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tin Ceiling Company</a>. They managed the faux finish on the walls themselves using a basic rag roll glazing technique (but substituting lace for the rag) and finishing things off with a soft blending brush, using a similar technique that was used in the living room.  The barn light above the dining area is from <a href="https://www.barnlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barn Light Electric</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Pedro sanded and finished the floors to preserve the original wood and inlay border with a high gloss luster. To conceal the steam heat pipe in the living room corner, Pedro boxed out the section and added a decorative grill from <a href="https://aagrilles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Architectural Grills</a>. While the work in the living room was largely cosmetic, Colin and Orli are grateful to Pedro for his painstaking replicas of much of the building&#8217;s original details. Pedro custom-built the floating shelves to carry the same ornate lines of the picture rail molding. He was also able to largely match the trim molding that had previously existed with support from Dyke&#8217;s Lumber. However, since the door and window casements were not available off the rack, he went the extra mile and personally cut hundreds of feet of trim material to match the original art deco detail Colin and Orli loved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we ventured just a ways up the street from Sweeten&#8217;s NYC headquarters to the East Village for a tour of a gut-renovated one bed, one bath co-op. This place was &#8212; to use the technical term &#8212; a disaster. As the apartment&#8217;s new owner, Henry, was clear to note in his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, the kitchen was destroyed, the bathroom was destroyed, the living room was destroyed&#8230;the whole place needed modern re-design and upgrades that would improve flow and use of space. Henry couldn&#8217;t move in until work was done, so we introduced him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> to manage some serious demolition and rebuilding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-henrys-east-village-condo-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14126 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover" width="600" height="410" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_HenryApt-cover-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14111"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry works for an investment bank in New York City and took an appraising look at the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedroom of his new purchase. It wasn&#8217;t just that the unit had considerable damage in each room, Henry also saw the potential for better use of space and ways to connect the rooms to one another. He planned to remove a dividing wall between the kitchen and living room and re-orient the kitchen so that it would open toward the rest of the apartment and let more light in. Henry also found himself puzzled by decisions the previous owner made in the bathroom. Half of the bath had been lined with faux wood paneling and the other half was inexplicably blocked off by the tub&#8217;s entire length. The East Village certainly has plenty of old tenement-building bathrooms, but this was on another level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14127" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/unnamed-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team played a big role in suggesting solutions, finalizing layout plans, and selecting materials for this full overhaul. The kitchen wall came down to reveal a generous open living area, and the team installed brand new pre-finished 5&#8243; wide plank wood flooring (from <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Solid-Hardwood/Plank/N-5yc1vZbejwZ1z0wtnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>) to unite the entire apartment. Henry went with his experts&#8217; consensus that white shaker cabinetry would modernize and brighten the kitchen, and added a masculine, contemporary touch with a mixed material backsplash that incorporates dark and light steel and glass elements.</p>

Henry wanted a hood that wouldn&#8217;t stand in the way of the new open plan &#8211; extensive online research led him to a heavy-duty but slim and round <a href="https://www.siriuscappe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sirius stainless steel hood</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the team ripped out the old tub and put in Italian ceramic floor tiles that mimic a light wood grain finish. Henry decided on a simple and modern half wall and full shower tile and created a beautiful accent wall with rippled gray tile that suggests flowing water. The shower floor is now anchored with a blue-gray small cube tile. The team added a frameless glass shower door with chrome finishes and installed a modern, wall-mounted sink vanity that Henry likes for its clean lines and hotel spa look.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Henry&#8217;s expert team did a lot of cosmetic work to return the living areas and bedroom to full working order. Henry chose a <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/color-collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutral Benjamin Moore gray</a> and loves the tall, streamlined baseboard molding that the contractor suggested using. New closet doors with 93&#8243; height doors were added to the bedroom and the apartment&#8217;s east-facing windows are now stylishly dressed in warm wood blinds, another standard <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Decor-Blinds-Window-Treatments/N-5yc1vZar4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a> find.</p>
