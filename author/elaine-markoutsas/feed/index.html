				<p style="text-align: justify;">After our <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/interior-design-gold-glass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peek at spring-inspired style updates</a>, I have been looking forward to talking with Sweeten interior design experts to answer a long-standing question of mine: what does it cost to work with an interior designer? I needed to check my ego at the door for this one &#8211; I know I need professionals for home renovation projects, but I should be able to pick out my own couch&#8230;right? After talking with three of Sweeten&#8217;s most successful interior designers, I have a very different outlook on that front. For the basics on pricing, I caught up with Sweeten Expert Joy, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Maneli</a>, and Sweeten Expert Jill.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Joy, Maneli, and Jill helped me clear up one misconception right off the bat: interior designers are equipped to do much more than pick out furniture. Whether you are planning to gut renovate your home or looking for a way to update what you already have with new pieces, interior designers can step in at any stage in the process and lend expertise that ranges from wall placement, technical wiring choices, floor and tile selections, lighting and layout, and then continue until the last decorative pillows and desk accents are placed. &#8220;Furniture, window treatments, millwork design, lighting, flooring, AV, landscape selection, painting, and plaster types&#8230;interior design involves the knowledge of electricity, plumbing, wall construction, etc, all beyond creating the coziest of sitting areas,&#8221; explained Joy. Â So with such a wide range of services, where do they start with pricing?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Size, Scope, and Schedule</b></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">It sounds like the key elements of budget planning involve space size and scope of work (the homeowner&#8217;s goals for the project and initial thoughts on the corresponding budget). The good news here is that homeowners can maintain a lot of control over the final budget of the project. If you&#8217;ve been following our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>Â and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroomÂ pricing guides</a>, you know that for some renovation projects, you need to spend thousands of dollars on behind-the-scenes structural and technical costs regardless of how high-end you want the end result to be. With interior design projects, the bang for your buck feels more predictable and impactful, because you are spending on items that you can see and feel, and you have more control over the relationship between what you pay and what you get.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Options for Structuring Costs</b></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">You can probably expect your interior designer to propose a few options for setting the budget:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">1. flat fees for different packages of service</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. hourly fees for consultation and visits</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. 20% to 35% mark-up on purchases and services (like contractor oversight), or a commission based on the cost of planned construction (if renovation work is happening)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. a mix of these options to allow for more flexibility</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you areÂ <b>gut-renovating and relying on your interior designer for full design services</b>, you can expect to spend aroundÂ <b>$10 per square foot on design services</b>Â alone. At this level, your interior designer is deeply involved in the project from start to finish and is sourcing, purchasing, and ensuring the delivery and installation of every visible aspect of your home. If you are gut-renovating a 1,000 square foot property, you can expect to pay $10,000 on design services, separate and apart from the cost of materials. If the scope of your project involves highly specialized selections or high-end and exclusive artisan work, you can expect the design cost per square foot to rise accordingly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>photos below featuring work in Manhattan byÂ Sweeten Expert Joy</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11470 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-08.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-08-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11480 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-10.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="855" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-10-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11468 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-06.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-06-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you areÂ <b>focused exclusively on furnishings</b>Â and are not planning any renovation work, you might see a cost proposal where you pay the designerÂ <b>20% to 35% of the total cost of the merchandiseÂ </b>you purchase, or you might see a cost structure that combines a flat fee with hourly fees or commission-based fees. At this level, your designer is providing a design vision with color and material selections, sourcing merchandise, and ensuring that pieces are delivered properly. All in, bare minimum, you might be able to do one room for $8,000 for design services and furniture, provided that you&#8217;re open to mixing thrift shop finds with national retailer-type pieces with a few select higher-end accents. With a more average budget, you can expect to spend $15,000 to $20,000 for design services and furniture selections for one room.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You might find that you can conserve costs by handling some of the purchase and delivery logistics on your own, but you should be realistic in your capacity and desire to do so. Art will arrive in the wrong frame and rugs will fall off the truck en route, so you need to be prepared for the follow-up that a designer would handle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking forÂ <b>guidance with vision and finding particular items</b>, you might decide to work with a designer on anÂ <b>hourly basis, which can range from $75 an hour to $250 and beyond</b>, or you might agree to a flat fee for a &#8220;mood board&#8221; or &#8220;inspiration booklet&#8221;, where the designer provides you with layout, color, and material selections for the room but leaves the sourcing and buying to you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>excerpt below from a design plan byÂ Sweeten Expert Jill</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11485 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-13.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-13.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-13-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Although I think clients find hourly fees easier to digest &#8211; and it can sound less expensive &#8211; I often find that the opposite is true. Clients often underestimate the time that goes into a project,&#8221; noted Jill.Â &#8220;I want to have the discretion to spend the time that may be necessary searching for the perfect piece without worrying about billing my client hundreds of dollars.&#8221;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Savings and Access</b></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As you think about these potential upfront costs, you also have to consider two major benefits to working with an interior designer that might not be immediately obvious. My own personal &#8220;A Ha!&#8221; moment came when I realized that interior designers can tap into two of my most favorite life-long quests: hidden savings and access! Because of to-the-trade discounts and insider access to industry sales, an interior designer can save you up to 40% of the cost that you might otherwise pay for materials and furnishings. Joy cracked me up: &#8220;I take on the aspect of saving clients money like a game show participant! I go hard as though Iâve got to throw my hand on a buzzer!&#8221; So while you may be calculating the costs of working with a designer, the experts I talked with more than made up for those costs with savings that would be out of reach for most homeowners.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the value saved, an interior designer can get you access to items that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to get on your own, and can mix high-brow and budget items seamlessly, so that you are spending money on things that matter most to you. An interior designer will be able to get a custom piece that you will never see at a national retailer, and mix that splurge with vintage picks, or restore an antique or thrift shop find with a unique fabric to create a custom piece at a fraction of the cost.Â Jill warned that we should &#8220;be prepared for the price tag that to-the-trade and custom items have, even after a designer discount. There is value in beautiful, quality made items and I love to support the people making this work. However, I try to provide all of my clients with some special and unique pieces, no matter what their budget is.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><i>photos below featuring work by Sweeten Expert Jill</i></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11487 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-14.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-14-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11486 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-12.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="429" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-12.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-12-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>More wise words from these wise ladies</b></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Joy, Maneli, and Jill each shared super insightful guidance to keep in mind if you are planning a design upgrade. Jill offered savvy guidance for homeowners who are feeling unsure about their financial ability to replace an entire room of furniture at once,Â &#8220;work with a professional to create a design plan that can be executed over time as funds become available.&#8221; She also recommends not to forget about accessories, the &#8220;final layer&#8221; that can really make a house your home. &#8220;Arrange a vignette of interesting or meaningful items, hang some art and bring in some greenery &#8211; a large plant can really add life and sculptural interest to a room.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Joy highlighted the key role that timeline can play in a budget. If you have time for your designer to find the right pieces and pay for standard shipping, you will get the look you want without paying a premium to rush orders. Lead times for custom pieces and shipping fees can balloon if you are on a deadline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Maneli suggested that homeowners planning extensive renovation and design work should think about their budget in two buckets: one budget for the materials that will come with them when they move (furniture, art, drapery, etc.) and one budget for the materials that will stay with the house and add to its re-sale value (permanent features like lighting fixtures, wall treatments, custom millwork, etc.). By grouping expenditures that way, you can decide what to allocate for things you will keep for decades, and what you will invest in the value of your home.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>photos featuring work in Williamsburg byÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Maneli</a></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11474 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-03.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-03-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11473 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-02.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="952" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-02-189x300.jpg 189w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-02-567x900.jpg 567w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11475 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-09.jpg" alt="interior design nyc" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SWEETEN_interiorDesignGuide-09-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If these photos aren&#8217;t enough to convince you that you need an interior designer in your life, take a look at our quick cost re-cap below, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get started with your project onÂ Sweeten</a>!</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Interior Design Costs: Key Considerations</b></h3><p>~ IfÂ you are gut-renovating, plan for $10 per square foot in design services alone.</p><p>~ If you are replacing furniture, plan to pay 20-35% of the net cost of your merchandise purchase.</p><p>~ If you are looking for ad hoc design help, plan to pay $75 to $250 per hour of consultation.</p><p>~ Remember that designers get to-the-trade discounts that can save you between 20 and 40% off the retail price.</p><p>~ All in, you should plan for an average of $15,000 to $20,000 for a full room re-do, and account for shipping costs and premiums you might pay if your timeline is tight.</p><p></p><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1641798293318"><p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does an interior designer cost?</strong></strong></p><p class="schema-faq-answer">If youâre doing a gut home remodel, expect to pay $10/square foot for full interior design services.

The first is to charge a flat fee for different service packages. These packages are tailored to the needs of the client. The second is to charge an hourly fee for any consultation and site visits. The third way is to add a 20%-35% markup on purchases and services (such as contractor oversight), or a commission based on the cost of planned construction if the client is renovating. An interior designer might also charge clients with a mix of these options, which provides more flexibility.Â </p></div></div>					</div>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">From kitchens and home offices to outdoor spaces</span><span class="s2">, the top Miami home remodeling trends point to function, customization, and color</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg" alt="A balcony in Miami with a water view" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52441" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Miami, homeowners are increasingly drawing their design inspiration from color and nature. At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve observed how these themes inform the most popular Miami home remodeling trends. It&#8217;s clear that h</span><span class="s1">omeowners are rethinking both aesthetics and function, indoors and out. In this guide, Sweeten shares popular home remodeling design trends in The Magic City.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in Renovation Financial Protectionâfor free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Home remodeling projects in Miami are robust. âTheyâre putting money into their homes,â said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. âThey see it as an investment.â </span><span class="s1">Adrian said that much of his remodeling work has less to do with adding square footage. Itâs more about reconfiguringâtaking away and adding walls, refreshing appliances, and fixtures.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen trends for functional and style</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consistently close to the top of the remodeling project list in Miami is the </span><span class="s2">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. âItâs the heart of the home,â said <a href="https://samrobin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based interior designer Sam Robin</a>. âMy philosophy about it hasnât changed much. If I entertain 100 people in my home, theyâll all end up in the kitchen.â With the kitchen serving as both a functional <em>and</em> fashionable space, Miami homeowners are upgrading the room to work hard and look appealing. Below, Sweeten lists the go-to updates Miami homeowners are requesting for their kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="gray-bathroom-with-gold-hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Upgrading kitchen appliances</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So many renovation plans include updating and re-prioritizing the styles and functions of appliances. The nationwide trend is toward cooking with wellness in mind, so steam ovens are becoming more prevalent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Induction cooktops are catching on (âabsolutely, very trendy,â said Adrian. Sam said she still prefers gas ranges.)</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Flexible room design</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchens opening to a great room are still popular, with cabinets that look more furniture-like. But thereâs definitely a move to closing off larger spaces when desired. Sliding, French, and barn-style doors do the trick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands are being more defined by function, so Sam has specified double islands for some clients. Multi-level counters also are trending. The varying heights allow for different functions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">An organic look: Natural materialsÂ </span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the overall look in the kitchen, designer Sam said thereâs a trend to more organic, more natural materials. Itâs all about changes in textures. Graphic backsplashes include porcelain, terra cotta, or concrete tiles. These can be earthy or bold color combinations or monochromatic tone-on-tone patterns like herringbone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">âThereâs a big trend toward more rustic simplicity, like <i>wabi sabi</i>,â she said, such as cement walls or concrete flooring and countertops. Itâs a real organic living space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here are some other top Miami home remodeling trends in the kitchen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Simple, flat-panel cabinetry. Lacquer finishes mostly have given way to matte.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Farm-style and trough sinks are on the rise.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide-planked floors (seven inches wide is average), such as light rift-cut oak or dark wenge.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Statement lighting. Shapes include large scale globes, square-shaped, or linear fixtures, especially over countertops</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Metal hardware. Burnished brass still is trending as well as black matte. Sometimes theyâre seen in the same room.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg" alt="Marble bathroom with white double floating vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Bath trends for utility and statement materials</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Adrian has seen freestanding sculptural soaking tubs remain strong in Miami. However, many homeowners are preferring freestanding showers. Features like aromatherapy and steam showers are gaining traction. Thatâs especially true in luxury condos. <em>(For more info, see <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/miami-condo-renovations-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s Guide to Remodeling a condo in Miami.</a>)</em></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In larger homes in Miami Beach, bigger master baths are open to the master bedrooms. Adrian has installed barnyard-style doors, 6-feet wide (and wider, when more privacy is preferred.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The top Miami home remodeling trends in the bathroom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Floating vanities with integrated stone tops and storage drawers.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Stone and porcelain featuring dramatic veining that can be book-matched on statement walls.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Touchless toilets and motion-activated faucets are desirable wellness/hygiene features.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Multiple sources of lighting &#8211; Sam said while itâs important to include downlights, lighting around vanities (usually sconces) is important so that shadows arenât created.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, especially with tropical themes, palm trees, or foliage, is very popular in powder rooms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Outdoor space as an extension of the home</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bringing indoor style and all of their comforts outdoors is a goal. No matter what the style, the connection from indoors to out cannot be denied. âWe have such an inside-outside vernacular,â said interior designer Sam. âWe want to merge it because of a gorgeous landscape. Itâs like having a painting in every room.â</span><span class="s3"> Outdoor kitchens feature commercial-style grills, refrigerators, and wine coolers. Fireplaces or fire pits and water features add to the ambiance.Â Â </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg" alt="A stone walkway with palm trees in Miami" width="1000" height="1363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-220x300.jpg 220w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-600x818.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">âWeâve been doing large terraces,â said Sam. âAnd getting into more hardscaping, like paving materials. Thereâs a lot of wood, like ipe, a tropical hardwood that withstands the elements. Other materials for the outdoor space include travertine with grass in between, microcement, Keystone coral, and big boulders to create ponds. Weâre creating spectacular views, framed by foliage.â</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indoor rooms opening up to terraces with a series of French doors or doors that fold back is another way to connect with the outside.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Home offices get a makeover</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam also has gotten a lot of requests for home officesâhomeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">âClients want a good back wall, appropriate for video meetings,â said Sam. âSomething more professional looking, with style. They also want space for the kids to focus with computers and homework. Not just a playroom for a bunch of Legos.â</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam said that allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of function. For example, sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty, with sleepers and desks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">âAnd thereâs creative storage,â said Sam. âClosets can be transformed into storage file systems with nice millwork, which can be opened up (when needed) instead of having a separate room. It depends on personal preference.âÂ </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some even opt for more than one home office; the addition appears to be boosting resale value, even with a modest investment.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Miami home remodeling trends: Design details in the home</span></h3>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Impressing guests <em>and</em> personally savoring spaces</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Homeowners are investing money in renovation details that are big and smallâall of which make an impact on daily living.Â </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rolling bar carts make way for built-in cabinetry which holds wet bars, undercounter refrigeration, freezer, and wine coolers. âMy clients all want wine rooms,â said Sam.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg" alt="Home office with white and beige striped wallpaper" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sam Robin designed a home office in a bedroom for a pair of teens; painted stripes on the wall. Photo by Kris Tamburello.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other rising design trends in Miami home remodeling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide plank flooring, with an average of seven inches wide, in lighter woods like ash and oak. âItâs a European country vibe,â said Adrian.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Architectural light fixtures in simple modern shapes, linear forms, and organic shapes that feature leaves and tendrils are catching on</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">LEDS are replacing halogens. Thereâs more accent lighting, like under-cabinet and lighting coves.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Graphic tiles (including for the floor), as well as concrete patterned tiles, are quite popular. Black and white geometrics and heritage Cuban designs are inspirations.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Color palettes include earthy tones (creams and tans), blue and white (cobalt to watery blue-green), and vivid bold colorsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Important structural elements for Miami homes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another important consideration when remodeling in Miami is the threat of hurricanes. </span><span class="s2">Building codes</span><span class="s1"> are strict because of that. Concrete pillars, rebar and steel-reinforced walls, roof trusses and bracing roofs, and hurricane-resistant windows all are part of the conversation. <em>(</em></span><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s guide to Preparing Homes for Hurricanes</a>.)</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are no water restrictions, however, as there are in California. But because of Miami&#8217;s wet climate, materials need to be mold and mildew-proof.</span></p>
<h4>Finding the right general contractor for a Miami home remodel</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miamians are personalizing more while remodeling their homes. In their budgets and work scopes, homeowners ensure thereâs more room for a little drama. Bringing these types of specific design plans to life successfully requires an expert general contractor, and architect or design team. Are you looking for general contractor experts near you?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out the cost of renovating a house can be nerve-wracking for first-time Chicago renovators. Youâve finally moved on from daydreaming to starting a remodel of your home. Start by gathering some basic details: know what you can actually afford, and plan to add a small reserve on top of that. The materials you want to use also factor in, as well as how much work will be done. Plus, everything that isnât visibleâthe infrastructureâwill impact your costs. This can be a lot to keep track of, especially if this is your first time renovating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, we have done some of the legwork in this guide to Chicago remodeling costs. This guide focuses on some of the major remodeling categories: <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole house remodels</a>, kitchen, bath, additionsâas well as permits. You can use these details to create an accurate budget for a Chicago-area renovation.</span></p>
<h3>Baseline home renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hereâs a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs (including labor and materials) gathered from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p><b>Pro tip:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, itâs smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. Youâll also want to book a start date on the contractorâs schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs per square foot</h3>
<h4>Gut renovation vs. non-gut renovation</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutting a home pretty much means starting from scratch. You&#8217;ll take everything down to the studs or framework, and/or you&#8217;ll knock down walls. Because it&#8217;s more intricate, the average cost to gut and remodel a house starts at the higher end of the </span><b>$100 to $200</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf range. By contrast, a remodel of the space within existing walls will be at the lower end. For example, remodeling a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom condo may range from </span><b>$50,000 to $70,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while a gut reno likely will exceed </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This work usually involves running new plumbing pipes and wiring, moving doorways, and possibly installing new flooring.</span></p>
<h4>Full home gut renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a full home gut renovation start at </span><b>$105</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â per square foot. Take note: this scope of work is extensive! Expect demo, framing, insulation and drywall, wiring, plumbing, heating/cooling systems, millwork, paint, flooring, tile, light fixtures, electronics, and all finishes. (This excludes appliances, which can significantly increase costs, depending on how high-end they are.) According to Chicago-based</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, âA whole-house renovationâsay, 3,000 square feetâwould cost </span><b>$200,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the low end, and start at </span><b>$400,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the high end. It all depends on the materials chosen.â</span></p>
<h4>Wet room renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet roomsâconnected to a water supply, such as bathrooms or kitchensâtypically start at </span><b>$250</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. In the city, bathrooms in condos or co-ops can be as small as 30 square feet. However, in freestanding homes, they are typically larger than 5â x 8â.Â  High-end renovations that are fully custom with luxury materials can cost upwards of </span><b>$700</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot. Architectural design and drawings, demolition, construction, materials, fixtures, lighting, and finishes are included in the fee.</span></p>
<h4>Build in a buffer to your budget</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractors may build in overage fees to their estimates. This allows for the unexpected<span>â</span>which definitely can happen<span>â</span>to be covered. Overages are usually 10-15% of the project cost. (We recommend that the renovator reserve at least 10-15% above the bid as well). Don&#8217;t let the numbers shock you, though: the beauty of</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring <span style="font-weight: 400;">a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it&#8217;s one-stop shopping. Working with a contractor covers pretty much <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all the trades required for the job</a>. This spares you the work of hiring individual tradesmen to complete the various aspects of your project.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago-based</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6105#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Brad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommends being realistic about how much you can spend. âYou canât buy a <strong>$100,000</strong> ring on a <strong>$5,000</strong> budget. Nail down your contractor first; they know pricing. And add 15 percent for unexpected conditions.â</span></p>
<h3>Average cost of a kitchen remodel in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of remodeling a kitchen</a>, the typical starting point is <strong>$23,500</strong> based on a 100-square-foot space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This translates to stock cabinets from a big-box store with space to fit <span>a refrigerator, a four-burner range, a dishwasher, and a microwave. Materials could include laminate flooring, tile under $10 / square foot, and fixtures by Delta and American Standard.</span></span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have found that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamping a kitchen</a> measuring 100 square feet at this finish level can start at <strong>$35,500</strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <span>Opting for mid-grade materials is a smart way to strike a balance between cost efficiency and quality. Some reputable options to consider include Diamond or Kemper cabinets, Caesarstone countertops, Daltile floors, and tiles from TileBar and Ann Sacks. For fixtures, brands like Brizo, Hansgrohe, and Kohler offer reliable choices. </span></span></p>
<h4>High-end kitchen costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on what we have seen, expect starting costs to be <strong>$37,500</strong> for a 100-square-foot room at this finish level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect quality and craftsmanship with top-flight <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a>, stone or porcelain flooring, stone or quartz countertops, and tile from brands like <span>Cle Tile and Artistic Tile.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractor Ryan has seen kitchens cost </span><b>$50,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a gut remodel, and at the high end, closer to </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. âThose figures,â he says, âcan vary greatly, as some cabinetry alone might cost </span><b>$80,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.âÂ </span></p>
<h3>Average bathroom remodel costs in Chicago</h3>
<h4>Budget bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for a bathroom remodel</a>, you&#8217;ll need to settle on a realistic budget. A starting point can be </span><b>$16,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a standard full bathroom with <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget-friendly finishes</a> from big box stores like Home Depot, Menards, and Loweâs. Other materials for this budget <span>include stock vanities,Â </span>various tiles under $5/square foot,<span> and fixtures by Delta, Moen, and Pfister. </span>As this is a wet space, plumbing, electrical insulation, and exhausts, as well as correcting misaligned walls and floors will be part of the job.</span></p>
<h4>Mid-grade bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard full bathroom typically includes <span>a sink, toilet, and bathtub or shower. The fixture count for a full bath is 3â4. Starting costs</span>Â <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to overhaul a bathroom</a> is around </span><b>$26,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, standard toilet, fixtures by Kohler and Hansgrohe, vanity counter from Signature Hardware, and a porcelain tub.</span></p>
<h4>High-end bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical cost at this finish level starts at <strong>$37</strong></span><b>,500</b> for a standard-size bathroom<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features at this level include custom work, separate shower, freestanding tub, and custom lighting. High-end materials can include vanities by Robern and Duravit, fixtures by Brizo, and tile by Artistic Tile and Ann Sacks.</span></p>
<h3>Costs for a primary bedroom suite addition</h3>
<h4>Mid-grade primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated costs are around </span><b>$452</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$177,273</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 24&#8242; x 16&#8242; space, including double vanity, freestanding tub, separate shower, walk-in closet, dressing area. Whether itâs a ground-level addition, a basement remodel, or a second-floor addition, accessing rough-ins for plumbing will vary and affect pricing.</span></p>
<h4>High-end primary suite addition costs</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a 32&#8242; x 20&#8242; primary suite with a separate sitting area and large primary bath over a crawl space, costs are around </span><b>$553 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">psf or </span><b>$359,232</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This kind of project includes custom shelving, built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows.</span></p>
<h3>Basement renovation costs in Chicago</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A starting budget for a basement is around </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. At the low end, average renovation costs are around </span><b>$40,000, </b>which<span style="font-weight: 400;">Â includes a bathroom with a shower. Flooring options can vary significantly, including laminate, vinyl, engineered wood, porcelain tile, or stained concrete. At the high end, a project for </span><b>$75,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may include a 5&#8242; x 8&#8242;-foot bathroom with a shower, a wet bar, and flooring in an overall space measuring 20&#8242; x 30&#8242;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> can be affected by multiple factors. Consider the existing condition of the space, if plumbing pipes need to be installed or moved, if new water service is required and if bracing needs to be done to eliminate structural supports in the middle of a space. Also take into consideration ceiling height, since Chicago basements are typically 8 feet or less, and as low as 6â7â³. If you want to raise the ceiling, that requires digging out and underpinning the foundation. In addition, itâs necessary to assure the space is waterproof. A perimeter drain tile system is installed (repaired or extended). Connecting it to a sump pump also is important to consider, and this cost can start at around </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Chicago remodeling costs for permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permit process for renovating varies from Chicago to its suburbs, with each of the villageâs or townâs governing bodies determining requirements and fees. In Chicago, permits are obtained through the Building Department. The issue in common is safety and compliance with building codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Winnetka, remodeling permits cost </span><b>$30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of construction; new construction is </span><b>$1.30</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per square foot of new gross area. There also are permit fees for plumbing, electrical service (</span><b>$9,800</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 amp service; </span><b>$21,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 400 amp service), furnace, and AC as well as roofing and pools. In Hinsdale, the permit fee for remodeling is calculated on two percent of the value of construction.Â  In addition, expect to pay permit fees for demolition (</span><b>$3,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chicago, applications for building permits must include architectural drawings and names of all licensed contractorsâplumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors (usually supplied by the general contractor). There is no one size fits all. But expect to pay between </span><b>$1,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minimally for a whole house remodel, major kitchen, and/or bath. The larger the project, the more the fee, ranging to as high as </span><b>$10,000.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereâs also an Easy Permit Program for small projects that do not require architectural drawings (usually available the same day). There are nominal costs (a few hundred dollars for plumbing and electrical permits), which usually are pulled by those contractors.</span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">If youâre doing a gut renovation in Chicago, budget from $100â$200 per square foot (costs will be lower for a non-gut). For any renovation, wet roomsâspaces with plumbing, like kitchens and bathroomsâwill cost more than dry rooms. Materials and finish level will heavily impact costs. Budget-conscious Chicago homeowners should consider big-box stores for savings, while those with bigger budgets may opt for fully custom features or foreign-sourced items.</p>
</div>

			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">âWe didnât really see much of a change,â said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. âIt&#8217;s just a redirect.â</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span>Â âThe cost of lumber is affecting building,â said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. âPeople are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.â</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">âA lot more people are fixing their exterior,â said Trevor. âPeople want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, thatâs where you spend 60 percent of your time.â</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. âItâs all about indoor-outdoor living,â she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. âThey double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,â said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, âdefinitely going back to nature.â Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. âA salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, thereâs a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.â</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). âItâs generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,â said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. âTheyâre knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.â</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">âYou can build a second story,â said Sweeten contractor Trevor. âItâs contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. Itâs getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.â If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">âItâs where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,â said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. âItâs like changing wardrobes.â</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But thereâs not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, thereâs more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looksâtile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">âHere in LA, my clients donât want polished,â said Jeanne. âI am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.â Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because itâs pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colorsâblack, deep blues, and bottle greensâare ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. âI do a lot of antiqued blueâlike a muted denimâwith brass pulls,â he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trendâwith an average of 7&#8243;âand in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you wonât find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli.Â </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divideâchoosing between tub and showerâis more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>

<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. âEspecially with the pandemic,â she said, âThereâs a desire for bigger mudrooms. Itâs like a decontamination areaâcoming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.â Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Thereâs an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">âItâs a very popular room right now,â said Sweeten contractor Trevor. âItâs only going to get more popular. Iâve had three customers recently tell me they want librariesâreal traditional, with everything built in.â</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husbandâs office more fashionableâbecause of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">âMid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,â he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming backâI would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently Iâve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.â</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. Itâs part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash.Â Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">Thereâs an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">âSimplicityâweâre definitely going in that direction,â said Sweeten contractor Trevor. âNot so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.â Thereâs a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California styleâwith a modern or rustic refined lookâstill is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>
</ul>

			<h2 class="p1">From kitchens and outdoor spaces to flex rooms, Chicago home design trends point to customization, utility, and eye-grabbing accents</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="tiny-breakfast-nook-green-wallpaper" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50583 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg" alt="tiny breakfast nook with round table and chairs and green wallpaper after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_unpatterned-built-in-banquette-mudroom-feature-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller.

<p>Like homeowners nationally, those in Chicago are looking to remodel their homes to do more and with style.</p>
<p>When tackling remodeling projects, theyâre going beyond whatâs new. Theyâre considering exactly what they want, prioritizing to meet the budget. The overriding themes: comfort, convenience, cleanliness, and wellness.</p>
<p>With the help of interior designers, <a href="http://www.unpatterned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carly Moeller of Unpatterned</a>, and <a href="https://inspiredinteriors.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Mackie of Inspired Interior</a>, both based in Chicago, we explore Chicago home design trends to watch.</p>
<h3>What Chicagoans want in a home renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">Spaces topping remodeling lists in Chicago havenât changed muchâkitchen, bath, and outdoor. But the ingredients and wish lists have. In addition, there is a new desire for multitasking areas. Some actually point to a move away from open-concept plans to spaces with more definition. Still, the open kitchen/family room is a winning combination.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="white-living-gray-wall-panelling" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50585 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg" alt="white living room with gray wall panelling and long windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_inspired-interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Michael Alan Kaskel</em></span>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whole house renovations</a>âgutting as well as <a href="https://chicago.curbed.com/2020/2/28/21152809/adu-chicago-legalization-coach-house-granny-flat-affordable-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding on or building up</a>âare still on track. Perhaps even more popular is reconfiguring an existing footprint. Itâs a creative challenge thatâs also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost-effective</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Chicago homeowners are less inclined to go to cookie-cutter plans. Instead, theyâre opting for customization, making remodeled spaces their own. Making sustainable materials choices also is more intentional.</p>
<p class="p2">âRemodeling is a little less restrictive,â said designer Carly Moeller. âItâs not about âIs this OK for resale?â Itâs about how I want it. Am I happy when I walk in? Making it your own.â</p>
<h3 class="p2">Kitchens increase function and style</h3>
<h4>Cabinetry and appliances</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Kitchen cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless styles convey clean lines</a>, with modern hardware or without. Move away from the extra carvings and moldings. Look for a shift from neutralâespecially all white. Most liked: hues from soothing, livable shades like blue-green, blues, and greens.</li>
<li class="p2">Islands are changing shape and size.Â  &#8220;Stepping down&#8221; creates multiple levels of countertop for different functions. Longer, narrower islands also are a different look. Some cantilever over a perpendicular âtable.â Others house storage on one end, while open space to pull up chairs is on the other.</li>
<li class="p2">Induction cooktops are gaining fans. The method cooks food more quickly and is more energy-efficient. Plus French chefs have given them a seal of approval.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2">Countertops and fixtures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quartz is the new stone. Porcelain slabs also offer an alternative. Color, pattern, with dramatic veining spice up a range of looks beyond white marble. Both boast antibacterial properties and are easier to clean.</li>
<li>Tile backsplashes are making a splash with texture, tone-on-tone patterns, and geometric shapes.</li>
<li class="p2">So does statement lighting. Hanging pendants in multiples, ramped-up scale, and large horizontal fixtures lend importance. Organic shapes add appeal.</li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s2">Metal finishes for faucets and hardware add sophistication and modernity. Burnished gold and matte black are popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Whole-home features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smart Home tech connects smartphones with more activities in the home. Security, lighting, window shades, refrigerator thermostats, and range features (with cameras that monitor contents and cooking)</li>
<li class="p2">Ceilings are becoming a focal point. Wood beams, beadboard (painted or natural wood), and even wallpaper train our eyes upwards.</li>
<li class="p2">Wide plank wood flooring still is in vogue. However, very wide (12 inches) boards are less common than 5â7 inches.Â  âWeâre definitely using a lot of lighter finishes,â said Emily Mackie. âLimewashed looks.â</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">A place for everything: Storage in the spotlight</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Pantries are top of the wish list. Organization is essential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walk-in pantries</a> are preferred if thereâs room. Otherwise, pantry âcupboardsâ or pullouts feature cubbies for everything from spices to canned and packaged goods. âHomeowners want to be more creative about how they use space,â said Carly.</li>
<li class="p2">Prep kitchensâHigh-end designers find that clients like to separate prep from presentation and entertaining. The design includes a butler&#8217;s pantry-type of space or âsecond kitchenâ that keeps the mess out of sight.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bar-area-black-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50584 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="bar area with black cabinets and black leather chairs and long panelled glass windows after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_gentlemans-bar-Inspired-Interiors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em><span class="img-label">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast bars, bars, other built-insâOrganization drives these dedicated spaces. Equipment, accessories and cups, glasses, etc. all are within easy reach. âI did an a.m./p.m. cafe,â said Emily. âWe took a portion of the kitchen and made it a mini coffee bar by day and a wine bar by night.â</li>
<li class="p2">MudroomsâSome designers predict the demise of mudrooms. Still, the need for a place to contain outerwear, footwear, and sporting equipment isnât going away soon. âI donât have a mudroom at my house,â said Emily. âBut I have a dedicated closet space.â</li>
<li class="p2">Look for more hybrid spaces. For a couple with three children, Carly was asked to design storage space that would feel seamless, as it spilled into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modest-sized kitchen</a> and family room. Her solution: three lockers, one for each child, bench to one side with storage inside. For symmetry, thereâs a table with a bench and chairs on the other side of the cabinets. She painted the wall and lockers bright blue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Baths focus on refreshing body and mind</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Freestanding, shapely tubs are as much of a dramatic focus as they fill a need to chill out. The spa aesthetic is a target. Air tubs take over whirlpools while soaking tubs are most popular. âIâve been doing a lot more soaking tubs,â said Emily.</li>
<li class="p2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roomy showers</a> still favor rain effects and multiple showerheads. Even better is built-in sound.</li>
<li class="p2">Bidet toilets or toilet seatsâHygiene is a huge driver;Â  plus, you donât have to worry about running out of toilet paper.</li>
<li class="p2">Slab installations are gaining ground, especially with lighter-weight materials like porcelain. The seamless, groutless look gets a huge nod of approval.</li>
<li class="p2">Some storage ideas borrow from the kitchen. Emily created a bubble bath bar with a display rack for bath oils, crystals, and salts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Outdoor rooms are at-home getaways</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Compartmentalizing the landscape makes it flow from the indoors. Following interior cues, the goal is to createÂ <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovate-an-outdoor-space-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces for sitting, lounging</a>, entertaining, cooking, and dining. All in a green context, with plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers.</li>
<li class="p2">Roof decks, usually on the top of the garage are a solution for shrinking yard space. This requires adequate structure to hold furnishings, kitchens, and landscaping, with built-in irrigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" title="rooftop-deck-gray-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50586 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg" alt="deck on rooftop with gray table and chairs and teak tile floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emily_chicago_roof-deck-teak-tile-floor-Inspired-Interiors-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Design project by Emily Mackie in Chicago.

<ul>
<li>Outdoor kitchens feature built-in grills, refrigerators, sinks, and specialty equipment like kegerators to dispense draft beer. In the Midwest, pizza ovens are often part of the design. Chicago at-home chefs even use them in the winterâthey just shovel a path.</li>
<li class="p2">Freestanding heaters and built-in fireplaces extend the season. A range of firepit styles offers additional options.</li>
<li class="p2">Water features like ponds or small containers with waterfalls add a vacation vibe.</li>
<li class="p2">Entertainment includes outdoor-safe TVs and screens for movie-watching. âPeople are trying to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find ways to escape</a>,â said Emily. âWhen the home becomes the office, where do you go? Where there used to be square footage with a singular purpose, now I feel itâs a.m. and p.m.â</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home office goes beyond Zoom</h3>
<p class="p2">The home office has re-emerged, whether standalone or integrated into the kitchen or family rooms. Flex work styles are more plentiful. So homeowners are thinking again about WFH spacesâeven dedicated ones. Converting extra bedrooms or a spot in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement</a> offer options besides integrating into kitchen/family rooms.</p>
<p class="p2">âBasement offices have become hodgepodge rooms,â said Carly. âOne client needed flex space for kids to work, so we did three built-in desks with shelving.â</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-workstation-niche-open-shelves" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50582 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg" alt="gray workstation niche with open shelves and white desk after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Carly_chicago_built-in-desk-unpatterned-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(Above) Chicago design project by Carly Moeller. Photos by Dustin Halleck Photography.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Bedroom/bath suites are sanctuaries</h3>
<p class="p2">This remains a prime candidate for opening up small rooms or moving walls. âIn one, we turned the top floor into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary suite</a>,â said Carly. âThere had been two smaller bedrooms and a bath.â</p>
<h3 class="p2">Making room for hobbies, games, and exercise</h3>
<p class="p2">Activities like crafts, exercising, gaming, indoor driving ranges are inspiring re-dedication of real estate, especially in basements.Â  Thereâs a need for versatility and multitasking flex spaces. <span class="s2">This is not unlike the megamansion feature a few years back: dedicated rooms for wrapping packages.</span></p>
<p class="p2">âWorkout and meditation rooms also are requested. Square footage needs to be multifunctional,&#8221; said Emily. &#8220;Clients now are considering more creative solutions. &#8216;Why donât we rip out the dining room and put in a killer lounge?&#8217;â She continued, <span class="s2">âI converted my own garage. Lounge chairs, leftover rugs, heatersâfor the kids.</span>&#8220;The City Council of Chicago has removed a ban that had prohibited ADUs since 1957. Be sure to find a contractor who is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up-to-date on local codes and regulations</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Expanding space with visual tricks</h3>
<p class="p2">Adding large windows and skylights brings in natural light and visually expands space. Also, without adding square footage, raising ceiling heights makes a room live larger.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Chicago home design trends: Making a statement</h3>
<p class="p2">Chicagoans are personalizing more in home remodeling. Thereâs more room for a little drama. Focal points include sculptural bathtubs, kitchen islands punctuated with bold veining, or floor-to-ceiling featured fireplaces. Solving clutter in clean, functional spaces that are comfortable and make you feel good is the goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Focus on curb appeal and improvements like upgrading outdoor spaces or refreshing a kitchen</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Dallas.jpg" alt="Dallas home value" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Sprawling ranches. Craftsman cottages. Stone or brick architecture reflecting French or English style. A particular Dallas home caught your eye, and location and neighborhood made it right.</p>
<p>Unless you custom-built your home, there are probably some features youâd like to change. Your home may need more efficient windows or the master bath could use extra square footage. Whether youâre planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, itâs smart to keep in mind the potential for resale value. The clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your homeâs attractiveness to potential buyers. Here, Sweeten outlines some key tips if you&#8217;re remodeling a home in Dallas for resale.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and supportâfor free.</p>
<h3>What improvements increase your homeâs value?</h3>
<h4>Consider curb appeal</h4>
<p>A homeâs first impression speaks volumes. What catches your eye? You may notice attractive landscaping, interesting siding, a statement-making front door.</p>
<p>Replacing the front door in a Dallas home can recoup 63.7% of the job cost, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value</a> report for 2020. This is based on a price of $1,803 for steel.</p>
<p>A garage door replacement fetches 62.4% of value, at a cost of $3,600. Thatâs based on a 16&#8242; x 7&#8242; four-section door with insulated glass windows.</p>
<p>Re-siding a home with fiber-cement is a $15,881 investment for 1,259 square feet. Youâll get a 64.7% ROI (return on investment). For the same amount in vinyl, expect to pay $13,425. (50.6% ROI)</p>
<p>Another high-value project: replacing vinyl siding on the street-facing facade with manufactured stone veneer. The cost for 300 square feet of the bottom third, including sills and outlining entry archway, is $9,276. Youâll get back 86.3%.</p>
<h4>Replace windows</h4>
<p>Sure, new windows provide aesthetics, but the main motivation is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase energy efficiency</a>. Swapping out old windows with thermal windows has an ROI of 62.4% for vinyl and 53.9% for wood. Vinyl windows cost $17,101, based on replacing 10 existing 3&#8242; x 5&#8242; double-hung windows with insulated, low-E, simulated divided lights. The same amount of aluminum-clad wood (with wood frames inside) costs $20,884.</p>
<h4>Refresh the kitchen</h4>
<p>As the hub of the home, the kitchen may be its most important room. Its function is essential for daily living, especially for families and entertaining.</p>
<p>A lower-end Dallas kitchen remodel starts around $10,000 to $15,000. A minor facelift can offer a high return of value:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Maintain the same layout (make no changes in plumbing or gas/electrical requirements)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Replace cabinet fronts with classic shaker-style wood panels</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add new hardware</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add a new sink and faucet</li>
<li aria-level="1">Change out kitchen countertops</li>
</ul>
<p>A mid-range kitchen remodel can begin at $25,000. This is based on a 200-square-foot space with 30 linear feet of cabinetry and countertops. The ROI is calculated at 69.1%.</p>
<p>Major kitchen renovations start from $40,000 and can recover 46.5% of the investment. The difference in features is the replacement of cabinetry and stone or quartz counters with an imported ceramic or glass tile backsplash. It also includes a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, wall oven, and built-in refrigerator.</p>
<p>When updating a kitchen, consider current trends, but lean towards classic upgrades. This will assure that your kitchen has timeless appeal.</p>
<h5>Other major kitchen improvements:</h5>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Adding or expanding an island. This increases storage and creates spots for casual dining</li>
<li aria-level="1">Adding a pantry. Existing or borrowed space may be perfect for a walk-in pantry. If you donât have space, a tall cabinet with pull-out shelves handles storage needs. Standard cabinets range in size from 12&#8243; to 36&#8243; wide.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Update a bath</h4>
<p>Working within an existing 5&#8242; x 7&#8242; footprint, for example, will be the least expensive option. You still can replace the floor with ceramic or porcelain tile. New fixtures include a 30&#8243; x 60&#8243; porcelain-on-steel tub and a single lever temperature and pressure-balanced shower control. Expect the cost for a low-end bath remodel to be between $8,000 &#8211; $15,000.</p>
<p>A more upscale remodel bumps up the square footage to around 100 square feet. Costs start at around $30,000. All fixtures are relocated, which will increase plumbing costs. Features include a double vanity with stone counter and freestanding soaker tub. A 42&#8243; x 42&#8243; shower with body spray fixtures and frameless glass enclosure also is included.</p>
<p>How you customize your bathroom depends on your wish list. You can adjust your costs according to your priorities. Do you want a rain shower? Are you looking for a special color of stone or porcelain? Or maybe you&#8217;ve had your eye on a special shower or bathtub, which can pique the interest of buyers. A sculptural freestanding tub is a special focal point that makes the room stand out.</p>
<h4>Add or remodel a powder room</h4>
<p>Do you have the space to create a powder room in the main living area? If so, this can bring more value to your home. At an average of 18 square feet, you can splurge on some creative materials, wallcovering, and even bold color.</p>
<h4>Expand your outdoor space</h4>
<p>Outdoor living spaces have become an essential part of the home. Homeowners know the importance of being able to flow easily from inside to outside. This nationwide trend is equally strong in Dallas, a city ideal for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entertaining al fresco</a>. Start by examining your available outdoor space. How can you use that space to create equivalents for how you live indoors? Seating, dining, bar and cooking areas, lounging, and spots for firepitsâall are desirable features to choose from.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the value of flora! Landscaping can beautifully frame your outdoor living spaces while boosting curb appeal.</p>
<h4>Upgrading your outdoor deck</h4>
<p>Building a deck in Dallas out of composite material (a mix of plastic and wood product,) costs around $60 psf (per square foot) or just under $19,000 for a 16&#8242; x 20&#8242; deck. The cost for a wood deck (equivalent size, around 320 square feet) is around $40 psf or $13,000. Porcelain tiles are another attractive option. Theyâre freeze-proof and fade-resistant. Additionally, like composites, they require less maintenance.</p>
<p>In Dallas, wooden deck additions see a return on investment of up to 92%. Composite decks average a return of up to 60%.</p>
<p>A designated spot for a grill usually is in the plan. If you can afford the space and the extra budget, consider a mini kitchen. A built-in grill, outdoor fridge, sink, wine cooler, and even beer taps are among options available today.</p>
<p><strong>With the right help, remodeling a Dallas home for resale can be easy</strong></p>
<p>No matter what your budget is, do your homework before beginning a remodel. Some key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather inspiration photos to identify your likes.</li>
<li>Examine your current routine. How do you use your indoor spaces? How can you use your outdoor space?</li>
<li>Weigh the costs. What do you want to splurge on? Where will you recoup resale value?</li>
<li>Connect with experienced, vetted general contractors in your area. Sweeten can help here!</li>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Itâs no surprise that baths are topping many remodeling lists these days. In Houston, real estate comes in a variety of architectural styles, from French Country and bungalow to Queen Anne and ranch. Plus, b</span><span class="s1">ath trends today cover a range of dÃ©cor styles that are compatible with your homeâs architecture. For those considering their own small bathroom renovation in Houston, here are the need-to-knows and items to plan for before you begin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and supportâfor free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your goals for your bathroom renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most people doing small bathroom renovations, updating the bathroom design is the #1 priority. Who doesnât welcome a glow-up, especially in the bathroom? Modernizing dated cabinetry and hardware, and installing more stylish faucets are go-to options. So is swapping out a tub for a shower. Or, upgrading the shower with a thermostatic system with integrated volume control. Maybe your luxury shower dreams include multiple body sprays and a rain shower! Many homeowners opt to remove old, tired </span><span class="s1">for a refreshed version. Another key focus in bathroom renovations is adding extra storage.Â </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your needs?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thatâs easier to figure out. Who will use the bath? In a medium-sized bath, do you prefer a tub or shower? Single or double vanity? Take clear notes on any must-have features in your bath.Â </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgeting for a bath remodel in HoustonÂ </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help you sort it out, here is what you can expect to pay in Houston, on average. Retaining the footprint in a mid-range bathroom remodel in Houston starts at around $15,000, up to $25,000. Costs will vary based on the materials used, as well as the complexity of installation. For example, a mosaic backsplash is more affordable when the tiles are installed on a sheet. Micro mini tiles installed individually will be more labor-intensiveâand more expensive.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Materials costs can vary greatly as well, with super affordable options available at big box stores, versus high-end imported tile companies. A powder room may slide into a slightly lower entry-level for costs, but again, it depends on the materials you choose! <em>Read more about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home renovation costs for Houston.</a></em></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are you likely to recoup in value?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sixty percent, according to <em>Remodeling</em>âs <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Vs Value</a> report for Houston. Or, almost $12,000; based on a 5-by-7 foot bath that costs around $19,000 or $542 psf. This includes a new 30-by-60 inch porcelain-on-steel bathtub, new single-lever temperature, and pressure-balanced shower control, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long does a Houston bathroom renovation take?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten contractors, construction time averages about two to three weeks. However: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning, executing, and finishing</a> can take six weeks to three monthsâdepending on the size and complexity of your project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to get the most bang for the buck</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When your space is dimensionally challenged (read: small), and you donât have the room or budget to expand, you still have plenty of options. One way is to create the illusion of more space, by doing one or more of the following:Â </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Use wall-mounted vanities and toilets.Â  That extra floor space opens up the room.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Another space enhancer: a solid surface vanity counter with an integral sink.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Install a wall-to-wall mirror behind a long vanity or an oversized round mirrors. Mirrors visually expand space. Some streamlined designs incorporate medicine cabinets.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A classic pedestal sink also is visually slimming. Modern washstands, usually in metal frames, are on-trend options, especially white on black. More traditional sinks with turned console legs offer additional metal choices, like brass or polished nickel.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Building in storage wherever you can tuck in shelves for towels and essentials. Recessed niches in the shower for shampoo and conditioner also are smart.Â Â </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Swap a tub for a roomy walk-in shower with an all-glass frame. If thereâs a window, natural light will flow through, visually boosting the dimensions of the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why should you consider neutrals in the bathroom?Â </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many homeowners opt for white and beige in baths because itâs safe. But that doesnât mean it has to be boring! Designers use a few tricks of the trade to keep neutrals feel fresh. One trick is the magic of tone-on-toneâbut with nuances. (That means mixing different shades of neutral, from light to dark.) Another trick is to pair neutrals with different textures.Â  Get this look by pairing a dimensional wallcovering or an embossed tile with a polished or smooth surface.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding color to a bathroomÂ </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We love when homeowners go bold in the bathroom and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/home/design/article/35-ideas-to-amp-up-your-bathroom-s-style-15404821.php#photo-19670294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color outside the lines</a>. Some argue that vibrant colors can take over smaller spaces, like powder rooms. But others feel thatâs the perfect venue for bold cobalt or emerald, a spicy tangerine, or saffron. Precisely <em>because</em> itâs a small space, you can afford to be dramaticâand even splurge on faucets and towel holders, plus lighting and a fancy wallcovering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Color doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to walls: consider the countertop or the vanity. Blues and greensâbright and paleâare gaining traction in traditional, country, and modern styles.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Comparing bathroom remodeling materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone has some hefty competition these days from porcelain tile. Porcelain is not confined to small format 4-, 6- or 12-inch tiles. Porcelain comes in slabs, some very thin yet sturdy, which can be applied to walls and floors. And with digital technology, manufacturers are able to replicate some of the most desirable marbles (Carrara or Calacatta) or granites.Â  The look of exotic-colored stones also is available with remarkable authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, matte black is a hot trend in faucets and hardware. Burnished and polished gold are also trending, and pairing them with black is especially chic. Mixing metals, like satin metal and polished nickel with gold also is more acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One guideline for choosing materials that are basically semi-permanent: Being on-trend (modernizing the classics) is fine, but being trendy (here now, gone tomorrow) is not.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Be sure to allow enough time</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as you have a plan, try to get through the selection process for materials as quickly as you can. Ask about inventory even before you place your order, so youâre not disappointed. You may be unpleasantly surprised to find that your favorite tile or stone, or that dreamy vanity you&#8217;ve got your eye on, will take an extra 6 to 8 weeks to show up. However, i</span><span class="s1">f you canât imagine living without it, go for it! It may be well worth the wait.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition and prep</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On average, ripping out old bathroom material is a dayâs work. It depends on how large the room is, and how extensive the renovation will be. For instance, removing a tile floor or wall may take a bit longer. Tweaking plumbing and electrical, which may require rerouting or new wiring, also is part of the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Installation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Youâve passed through the rough and dirty parts, and now youâre in the fun phase. When surfaces, fixtures, and lighting get installed (allow 1 to 3 days), take a moment to enjoy it! Grab some pictures on your phone to show your family and friends.Â </span></p>
<h3>Follow the experts&#8217; lead for small bathroom renovations</h3>

<h3>Taking advantage of the high ceilings</h3>
<p>Home for Leah and Brian Olson is a Logan Square loft. They fell in love with the energy of the neighborhood and the 1900s red brick warehouse, converted in 2006. âWe like the industrial look,â said Leah, âexposed brick, ductwork, high ceilingsâabout 14 feet.â The marketing consultant shares the space with Brian, a civil engineer, and Rex, their golden Labrador Retriever. âThe rooms feel big enough, even though the space is a compact 1,000 square feet.â</p>

<p>But time takes its toll on walls, floors, and style. âWe wanted to renovate,â said Brian. âWe felt it was time to update our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living space</a> to more modern standards.â</p>
<p>More to the point, said Leah, the place felt a little tired. âFrom the urgency perspective, we wanted to replace bedroom carpeting. Refinish the hardwood floors. Paint.â</p>
<p>âI was most excited about lightening up the space,â said Leah. âWe had lots of early 2000s brown and beige finishes. With our high ceilings, we knew we wanted it to breathe more.&#8221; They posted their Chicago loft renovation and were matched with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor who also connected them with the Chicago-based interior design firm Lydy Designs.</p>
<h3>The kitchen leads the way</h3>
<p>But from the âdesireâ perspective, the kitchen topped the list. The couple started with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a>. Once they committed to replacing cabinets instead of refinishing, the process escalated. âWe decided to do the bathroom as well,â said Leah. âWe wanted it more lightened up and airy.â</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-10.jpg" alt="black kitchen in a Chicago loft renovation" width="667" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-46867 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-10.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>They chucked laminate counters in favor of marble-look porcelain. Similar porcelain backsplashes keep the look seamless. They upgraded appliances that include an induction range instead of gas. An above-the-range microwave now has a more sleek stove hood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-optgif.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="1000" height="1241" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Their designer, Amanda Lydy, provided a couple of concepts to match their Pinterest likes. The color story, look and feel, and types of finishes, informed their choices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen stove" width="667" height="1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46868" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-11.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>Even though there are no structural changes, the new look is dramatic. Instead of dark cherry cabinets, there are now flat-panel matte black cabinets, dressed with polished nickel pulls and handles. Open shelving above the sink keeps everyday essentials at hand. Shelving in an in-base cabinet swivels out for easy access to pots and pans. âThere was a good amount of storage before,â said Leah. âBut now there are nice functional additions. A super handy pullout for spices, so theyâre not all shoved in a cabinet. I like the (new) microwave placement undercounter in a drawer (next to the fridge).</p>
<blockquote><p>
âJust taking a shower every day, itâs an oh-wow for me.â
</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46869 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen spice drawer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A burnished gold faucet lends an understated elegant note. An architectural sconce in the same finish sits above a counter bumped out about a foot off of the peninsula. âThe extended counter is nice for setting things out or prep,â said Leah.</p>
<h3>A calm vibe in the bathroom</h3>
<p>The footprint in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bath</a> remains the same. But instead of a bathtub/shower combination, there is now a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roomier shower</a>. Replacing very busy brown and white patterned marble is a soft white and gray stone lookalike.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="Chicago bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46861" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-07.jpg" alt="herringbone bathroom tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46864" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The 12â x 24â inch porcelain tile paves the walls in a gloss finish. On the floor, the finish is matte for slip resistance. Radiant heat keeps the surface toasty. âItâs pleasantly subtle,â said Leah. On the shower floor, the matte-finished tiles are laid in a herringbone pattern. Rainshower, dual heads, and a hand wand extend the bathing experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-05.jpg" alt="gold finish fixture" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46862" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>White cabinetry also visually expands the space. Burnished brass faucets lend the right dress-up touch. âJust taking a shower every day, itâs an oh-wow for me,â said Leah.</p>
<h3>Choosing new wood floors</h3>
<p>Although improvements to the rest of the living space are mostly cosmetic, they are impactful. Particularly with the floors. With a new hardwood installation in the bedrooms, there was a need for continuity to the existing flooring. Their Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor worked with Leah and Brian</a> on a color to replace the existing yellowing red oak.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-09.jpg" alt="hallway in a Chicago loft renovation" width="667" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-46866 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-09.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>âWe didnât want anything too light or Scandinavian,â Leah explained. âOr too dark. The dog sheds. The Roomba (vacuum) is going every day.â They settled on a 50-50 ebony and classic gray stain, finished in a water-based polyurethane.</p>
<p>This set a more refined backdrop for new furnishings and wall colors. âWe were aiming for something sophisticated that still felt fresh and clean,â said Leah. âWe didnât want anything too trendy or too referential to past styles, like mid-century.â</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-16.jpg" alt="living room in a Chicago loft renovation" width="623" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-46873 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-16.jpg 623w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-16-187x300.jpg 187w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-16-561x900.jpg 561w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p>In the living room, thereâs a palette of soft grays and cream. Brian loves the huge upgrade for the flatscreen TV. Instead of sitting on a stand, it now mounts on a bracket that swivels and tilts. So he can watch TV when he&#8217;s grilling on the balcony. LED lighting behind the monitor creates a glow, another fave feature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-08.jpg" alt="home office with brick walls in a Chicago loft renovation" width="667" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-46865 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-08.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>A huge window lets in a lot of light in the home office, so the couple went darker on the wall with a rich navy. A lighter, more modern desk and storage make work more efficient. A wing chair and ottoman provide a cozy spot to read. An antique grandfather clock is a family heirloom. In the bedroom, slate blue walls complement a new white upholstered headboard outlined in nailheads.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-03.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46860" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Homeowner tips on a Chicago loft renovation</h3>
<p>âI love being in the kitchen,â said Leah. She found the space fun and special and no longer a chore. âOur home <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fits with the stage of life</a> weâre in right now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It (gives) a sense of accomplishment living in a space that we spent so much time and thought <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning out</a>. Everything feels lighter, more open.&#8221;</p>
<p>âItâs a journey,â says Leah. One that Brian especially enjoyed. âI geeked out during the whole home renovation, seeing how everything was taken down and put back together.â</p>
<p>Leah shares their renovation tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If youâre doing it as a couple, make sure youâre on the same page</li>
<li>Be open to designs you may not think you like</li>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45322" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boston-Blog.jpg" alt="Boston old house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boston-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boston-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boston-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a 250-year-old history, the Boston housing stock is flush in centuries-old buildings. Here, Colonial, Federal, and Victorian styles are among the many that enrich the residential landscape. While many exteriors tend to be well-preserved, interiors commonly need to be updated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers an outline on what to know before starting older home renovations in Boston (plus, which rooms get the most bang for the buck!)Â </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and supportâfor free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Upgrading electrical in Boston homes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes us comfortable in our homes? What will most improve the layout and/or function? Before you start with the obvious, consider whatâs not visible, but is still very impactful.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter what the scope of your remodeling isâthe whole house or just a kitchen and/or bathsâelectrical service may need a boost. One 100 amp circuit box may not be enough. For a 2,000-square-foot home, 200 amps are optimal. Itâs better to go bigger, allowing for add-ons in the future, since itâs more cost-effective. A professional electrical audit helps determine what needs upgrading (like adding GCFIs where there is water, in kitchens, baths, laundry rooms, for example).</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Older home renovation &#8220;Must&#8221;: Bring the HVAC up to speed</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the age of the heating and cooling systems, you may want to replace units for more efficiency. Newer systems have been designed to work better. Sizing is calculated according to square footage; sometimes two or more furnaces and air conditioners are needed. Make sure ducts are insulated. Zoning spaces also is smart, so that you can shut down areas of the house that may not be used all the time.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Note that AC units manufactured before 2010 contain Freon. That R-22 material has been banned by the EPA (as of this year) because itâs ozone-depleting. Itâs still available, but much more costly. Eventually, those air conditioners will need to be retrofitted for a new refrigerant or replaced as supplies run out.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hot water heaters generally have a shelf life of seven years. If you need to replace one, consider high-efficiency tankless heaters. They supply hot water on demand.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improve window efficiency</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even the best HVAC system wonât work optimally if you have leaky windows. Single-pane glass common in older homes often is a source of heat loss. Consider replacing windows with Energy Star-qualified ones. Options include all-wood, vinyl, aluminum-clad with wood inside, and fiberglass.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Features to look for:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â¢ Low-E, or Low-Emissivity, with metallic coatings that allow windows to reflect rather than absorb heat</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â¢ Double or triple panes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â¢ Gas-filled (argon or krypton gas) between glazed layers to improve heat insulation and slow heat transfer</span></p>
<h3>Allow for contingencies</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âWe try to work within a budget,â says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7012#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Jeff</a> who is based in Boston. But once you open everything up, he says, there may be structural work beneath a ceiling. Or fixing a slant on a floor. </span><span class="s1">âI recommend allowing at least 10 percent extra,â he says.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Boston-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6941#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Peter</a>, for example, talks about problems inherent to Boston buildings 200 to 300 years old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âA lot of structures in Downtown, South End, Back Bay neighborhoods, sit on wood piles. Thereâs a regulation many donât know. When you renovate, you have to put in rainwater discharge to maintain water level. Thatâs so the piles donât rot when the wood gets exposed to oxygen.â</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to preserve the best elements of your older Boston home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One blessing of older homes is inheriting original features. Hardwood floors, crown moldings, and wood built-ins add warmth and character. If the materials are generally in good shape, itâs best to restore. Even if repairs are in order, costs usually are far less than replacement. Lifting up wall-to-wall carpeting may reveal intact hardwood. Sand out tack holes and refinish the floors. Yellowed boards can also be fixed with sanding. Stain, or leave the floors natural, topped with non-yellowing polyurethane. And relocating a built-in can save thousands of dollars. It&#8217;s possible, for example, to repurpose a kitchen cabinet as a linen closet.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Make a master plan</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once youâve brought electrical and mechanicals up-to-date, youâre ready to dive into room remodels. Create a wish list in order of your &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves.&#8221; Sweeten gets you started with a renovation cost guide <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for the interiors in Boston here</a>. <span class="s2">One way to keep the costs down is to maintain the existing floor plan. </span></span><span class="s1">Add about 10 percent more to your final budget for contingencies. Donât forget to factor in the cost of permits and dumpsters.Â </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen: the hub of the historic (and modern) home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most, remodeling the kitchen is the biggest game-changer. Itâs at the core of todayâs livingâno matter what your lifestyle. For those who love entertaining, itâs even more pivotal.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The price tag for a kitchen remodel, of course, is affected by <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials and appliance choices</a>. You may want to splurge on a dual fuel range and choose a more modest dishwasher or refrigerator. Once you start comparing prices, you can play the balancing act. Decide whatâs most important for your lifestyle. Ultimately, there are a few key kitchen renovations you can do (on a budget!) for an older home in Boston.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing appliances</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication is critical, particularly in kitchen re-design. Contractor Jeff says that always involves prioritizing. âI am honest,â he says, about helping to choose appliances.Â  âItâs about balancing the budget.â So he might discourage a very high end brand refrigerator, especially if resale is an ultimate goal. âYou wonât get your money back if youâre going to sell,â he says.</span></p>
<h5>Cabinetry and countertops</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The choice of countertop and cabinetry materials can reduce line item cots. âYou can go to a lesser expensive quartz,âÂ  says contractor Peter. âAnd thereâs a lot of frameless off-the-shelf cabinets that look nice. These might even have soft-close features. These days, many prefer clean cut, straight lines.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the cabinets are in good shape, they may be candidates for a new stain or paint. Replacing the fronts with simple shaker-style wood panels is an easy facelift. New hardware also can raise the style quotient. For some, storage may be an issue. Reconfiguring interiors with slide-out shelves or adding deep drawers for cookware are one answer.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding or extending an island also may improve its efficiency. The additional surface extends prep and eating space. Then, you can build in more storage below it.Â </span></p>
<h5>Keeping or moving plumbing</h5>
<p><span class="s1">In a minimal remodel, itâs more cost-efficient to keep the plumbing in place. Re-piping or relocating pipes for remodeling adds between $5,400 and $7,000 (based on 1,500 square feet). Amping up the supply line from the main sewer to your home will assure a good flow of water throughout the home. If your water pressure needs help, ask your contractor whether a booster might work. </span><span class="s1">Obviously, an overall kitchen and bath plan for plumbing is ideal. Also be sure plumbers check for lead in pipes, valves, or faucets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Create a functional layout for your older home</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Floor plans in older homes may not work for today. Some are too small or have chopped up rooms.</span> <span class="s1">An addition may not be in your budget, but it may be possible to borrow space. Look at closets, small rooms, hallways, even a sunroom or porch. There may be enough space for a breakfast room. Creating a new layout may even net a family or a bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A powder room on the first floor is a must-have today. It also can provide a canvas for instant style. Since it doesnât require a large footprint, you probably can find the square footage. Some have even tucked powder rooms under back stairs. Without a shower or tub, a powder room is less expensive than a bath. So you might feel more comfortable splurging on some materials.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Refreshing a master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A spa bath may be on your wish list but not in your budget. Still, thereâs a lot you can do to get a more modern look. Replace the fixtures. Get a new vanity. Install light sconces as well as an overhead chandelier. You can give it all a luxury look with porcelain tile instead of marble or limestone. There are so many stone lookalikes at a fraction of the cost. </span><span class="s1">A mid-range bath remodel recoups close to 59 percent of the job cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âTry to create as much space as you can,â says Sweeten contractor Peter. âA tub takes up a lot of space. We often install showers instead.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both Sweeten contractors say that rain showers are high on Bostoniansâ lists, and thereâs a large enough price range to suit most budgets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even modest renovations to an older Boston home can be transformative! You&#8217;ll certainly realize thereâs an upside: the more you live in your home, the more youâll see its full potential with future renovation projects.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45153 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog.jpg" alt="outdoor patio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicago-Patio-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners have a major craving to spend time outdoors. </span><span class="s1">Without leaving home, that may mean lounging on a balcony less than 20 square feet, or up to a spacious roof deck. If you&#8217;re looking to refresh your existing outdoor space or build a new one, you&#8217;ll need to know where to start before swinging a hammer. Here, we share key tips on <span>building a roof deck and other outdoor spaces in Chicago</span> from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">House decks and patios</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adding a deck</a> is one of the most sought-after remodels in Chicago. And it brings one of the highest ROI (return on investment)â72 percent for wood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The prevailing design thought is to create a flow from indoors to out. That means designing a space in sync with your homeâs architecture and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovating-design-trends-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior decorating style</a>. In most Chicago homes, the main living space often is at least four feet above grade. So an ideal location for a deck is just outside a family room. French patio doors or sliders are the perfect bridge to the outdoors.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall deck size depends on the footage between the back of the house and the garage. Usually, thatâs minimal, considering that an average city lot is 25â x 125â. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-build-a-chicago-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garages</a> are at least 20 feet deep. And steps leading outdoors eat up space. Or, you might opt for a smaller landing area at grade, with a courtyard terrace in between the house and garage. That affords some opportunities for green spaceâa small tree, perimeter planting, and/or containers. </span><span class="s1">âWith a fixed amount of land,â said Chicago-based Sweeten contractor David, âyou have to make the most of what you have.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Older <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family homes</a>, like those in the northern fringes of the city, enjoy more sizeable backyards. Some have deeper lot sizes, while others may have side lots. Victorian houses often have porches, some that even wrap around. Patios are especially desirable, as they especially suit entertaining and grilling. Some of them are quite spacious.Â </span></p>
<h3>Outdoor space materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some options for patio materials include brick pavers and stone (bluestone is especially popular). Porcelain is gaining traction because thereâs a wide variety of lookalikes including slate, stone, concrete, and wood. Concrete offers different looks, too: staining or painting in colors and stamping, which can mimic flagstones. Synthetic composite polymer decking is another popular choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For outdoor deck spaces, some designers like to continue the look of flooring inside to out. Wide plank hardwood, for example, can transition to a synthetic decking in a similar shade. Porcelain plank options resembling wood are authentic even down to the feeling of a grain.Â </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another outdoor material option is wood, like teak, the Brazilian ipe, or South American cumaru. Sweeten contractor David is a fan. Ipe is a very dense wood that will not decay, and is resistant to termites, mold, and mildew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âItâs a little more expensive,â he said, âbut it doesnât rot and has fire ratings better than steel.â For roof decks, he has installed cumaru as a 20â x 20â tile. Tiles pre-drilled to fit tile connectors allow draining and picking up sections for repairs, like leaks on the roof. âThatâs the beauty of it,â he said.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Urban decks</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roof decks are particularly tricky outdoor Chicago spaces and there are city codes that must be implemented. For one, a garage with a roof deck requires a full foundation. That expenditure is between $12,000 and $19,000 for concrete alone for a typical 22â x 24â foot two-car garage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âIf you go within two feet of an adjacent building, the material has to have a one-hour fire rating. Thatâs two thicknesses of drywall before you get to the siding,&#8221; said David. &#8220;Also, a three-foot parapet wall is code. So is a membrane for the roof and a scupper, so water can drain off.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, if you have a grill, you need a fireproof landing. Slightly pitching the roof helps drainage. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contractors often coordinate</a> with landscapers, who can create a system of planters with integrated irrigation. Most decks these days have built-in electrical outlets. They cover not only lighting but charging laptops, and phones, or even installing ceiling fans in pergola-like structures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building a deck requires a permit. But itâs easier and takes less time to get than a typical building permit. </span><span class="s3">Sweeten contractor David also has built porches on several levels at the back of homes.Â </span><span class="s1">âWe did one that was only about 7 x 8 feet, a third-floor walkout right off of the bedroom,&#8221; David described. &#8220;It had a roof, with sides open. Theyâre putting in a two-person hot tub. â</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City outdoor living</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.toddmhaley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd Haley</a>, principal of the design firm, tmh, in Chicago, does most of his work in city highrise condos with balconies or private terraces. He has done outdoor kitchens, with grills, under-counter refrigerators, and wine coolers, with custom teak or ipe cabinets. One favorite quartz countertop wrapped around the ends in waterfall styleââa very clean look.â Itâs applied over waterproof fiberboard as a substrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThe big difference between doing something in the city versus the âburbs is that itâs like designing a yacht,â said Todd âEvery inch matters. In the suburbs, thereâs more room to play around.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âAlso, if you want to build a pergola, for example, you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/a-guide-to-an-hoa-before-you-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go through the HOA (Homeowners Association)</a>, get your plan approved per condo rules,â he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;That might be a lengthy process.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd changes up paving materials according to the location. On balconies, he usually uses painted concrete slabs; on terraces, wood plank flooring âfloating above the slab for drainage.â</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Fence aesthetic</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Sweeten contractor David, aesthetics are most important, and he doesnât like additions to look tacked on. He always is sympathetic to architectural style. With fences, for example, he sees an opportunity to look at them as sculptures. âIn wood-frame homes, I like (fences) to be more like a wall, to look like the house.â From that starting point, he said, you can create the hard spaces.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Connecting a home to an outdoor space</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That sometimes is challenging when homeowners want a more direct connection to a roof deck. âIn one location, weâre building a bridge from the second-floor back porch directly to the garage,&#8221; said David. &#8220;That also adds a degree of security so nobody can just walk up to the deck.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The general contractor also likes to create more gracious back entries. âTypically, we build a roofânot a flat roof, but one that complements the style of the house,â he explained. It also shelters from the elements âso you can stand there and not get soaked when itâs raining.âÂ </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Building wide stairs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other consideration is scale. A three-foot-wide set of stairs is hard to navigate with two bags of groceries, let alone kids. They are usually constructed five feet wide, ideally seven. Itâs more welcoming, too. &#8220;On the landing, it maybe didnât start out as a deck,&#8221; said David, &#8220;but because of the better scale, itâs more inviting. And you can put out some chairs, sit and have a drink.â Plus the shelter provides a comfortable spot without direct sunlight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âConsider the architectural style of the house when you build exterior spaces,â David said. âYou can look at the space 10 to 15 years later and say, âThose were good choices.â â</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639151627832"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the best decking material?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">The local climate will determine the best material for a deck. Pressure-treated pine hardwood, non-treated wood, composite, PVC, and vinyl are top decking material picks across all climates. Pressure-treated pine hardwood and vinyl are the cheapest options, at roughly $1.50 and $3 per square foot (psf) each. PVC and composite are more costly, at $4 and $5 psf. Non-treated wood runs from $4 psf for cedar, to $6 psf for redwood and $8 psf for ipe.</p>

<h3>A new place to call home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This New York homeowner had always owned property in Long Island&#8217;s Southampton, even while working overseas for over 10 years. Upon returning to the United States, she wanted to live closer to the village. So she sold one property and bought the other while still living overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house, located steps outside of the village, was a modest two-bedroom, one-bath, 800-square-foot 1960&#8217;s ranch with yellow aluminum siding. It previously had been a summer residence for an older couple who hadnât touched it since the 1980s.</span></p>

<h3>A clear wishlist</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, the interiors were outdated, storage was lacking, and space was tight. Still, she lived in the home for a year to better understand what she would like to change or improve. <span class="s1">âMy vision was modern, functional, relaxedâand most importantlyâtimeless,â she said.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The beach community location inspired a relaxed vibe.</span><span class="s1"> âBut I also wanted a cozy look that was inviting year-round for the cooler months.â said the homeowner. âThe house is small and I wanted to keep it that way.â Larger entertaining space was critical while sleeping spaces werenât as important. âI needed a bit more common space and modernization, including an open floor plan, natural light, and an indoor-outdoor connection,â she said. âAnother bath and bedroom were also in the plans.â</span></p>

<h3>Finding a contractor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With her Southampton home renovation ideas and concerns in mind, she posted her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, and found this Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1">She had three goals: a total renovation that included the kitchen; adding a third bedroom and second bath; and expanding the common living space by converting the garage. </span><span class="s1">âI could afford two of the three, but not all three,â she said.Â Â Â Â Â Â </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">My contractor was honest: âI can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.â So I was able to decide what really mattered and make a very informed decision that I can live with.</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="ranch living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44612" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Refacing the kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âThe contractor and I talked through options and figured out how we could come closest to getting all three within my budget. Kitchens are expensive but I wouldnât need to change the layout.âÂ  </span><span class="s1">The homeowner also couldnât afford to replace all the cabinets. Instead, she painted the lower portion in a darker gray, which masked the doorâs oak grain. She refaced the uppers and purchased new doors to change up the style slightly. They went from an arched to a simple raised panel that visually connects with the those below the counter. Hard-to-reach cabinets above the refrigerator were eliminated. All the upper cabinets were painted white, which made the space seem larger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44759" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>New floors</h3>
<p>The <span class="s1">existing brown kitchen floor tile was removed and red oak was installed to be consistent with the rest of the house, all stained in a honey hue. New hardware also refreshed the cabinet doors. The contractor also swapped out outdated tile for a feature mosaic under the range hood, and white subway tile on the remaining backsplash. New stainless steel appliances replaced a white refrigerator and dishwasher, as well as a black range, for a cohesive contemporary look. The room also received a new pull-down faucet, sink, and quartz countertop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âWith some creative problem solving, it does look, feel, and function like <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-trends-well-see-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a totally new kitchen</a>,&#8221; she said. </span><span class="s1">Without changing the kitchen footprint, she still picked up additional space. She calls her new walk-in pantry âicing on the cake.â The walk-in pantry is located just off the main kitchen, in part of what was the garage. âEveryone told me a garage conversion for storage was not a good idea because the space was just too small,&#8221; she recalled.</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg" alt="Hamptons kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44609" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Garage-turn-living room</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial step in the Southampton home renovation was to have the 14â x 24â garage gutted, creating a new living room. The new room features a vaulted ceiling and a shiplap fireplace, as well as that walk-in pantry. Converting the garage expanded the 800-square-foot home to 1,350 square feet of living space. The homeowner wanted the fireplace to be a focal point. &#8220;I chose shiplap, </span>but the way it was executed was beyond my expectations,&#8221; the homeowner recalled. A shift in the spacing and a slightly larger scale made a huge difference. It was built up to the point of the vault and a thick slate mantle instead of a wood one made it a true statement piece. &#8220;My contractor designed and built it himself,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3>A camouflaged finish</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional storage, refrigeration, and less-used items moved into her new pantry. &#8220;I put my microwave and other small appliances behind closed doors,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Itâs still super convenient because itâs attached to the kitchen.â </span><span class="s1">The exterior roofline did not change. âI didnât want it to look like a garage conversion </span><span class="s1">from the outside,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I built false carriage-style doors on the front exterior so it still looks like a garage.âÂ </span></p>

<h3>Blue, white, and gray palette</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She settled on a mostly white color palette with some gray accents, including new charcoal paint on the exterior faÃ§ade. The gray carrying over in slate at the front steps, rear entrance door, fireplace mantel, and one bath floor. Blue is a key decor thread, from the outside in. The exterior cladding has a bold new face in blue. In the main living spaces, the furniture has different shades of blue: pale blue well-worn painted metal stools at the counter; chairs around the dining table; and comfy chairs by the fireplace.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows for light with privacy</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Updating the baths also made an enormous difference. &#8220;</span>I happen to love transom windows for some reason,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I placed them particularly in the bathrooms for maximum light with maximum privacy.&#8221; <span class="s1">The master bathâs large walk-in shower are clad in 12â x 24â white stone-like Dolomite porcelain tile, with a dark gray porcelain tile grounding the floor. </span><span class="s1">Another update features a stylish new furniture-like vanity in honey-colored wood with horizontal grain that sits on brass feet, paired with a brass faucet.</span></p>

<h3>It all comes together</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her favorite part of her Southampton home renovation actually was the last third of the job. </span><span class="s1">âEach day there was something new, so I could see actual material being installed and the end in sight, versus &#8220;behind-the-walls&#8221; work like plumbing, electrical, gas lines, and new joists,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have windowsâyay! I have stained wood floorsâyay! As you get close to the end, you start to see your vision in real-time, with day-to-day progress. It makes all frustrations melt away, and you are a very happy person.â</span></p>

<h3>A calm and satisfying finished product</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing the homeowner appreciated was honesty and expertise. âMy Sweeten contractor was very patient, accommodating, efficient, and professional. Most importantly, a problem solver. My budget was tight, but I was given solutions that did not break the bank,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My contractor was honest: âI can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.â So I was able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decide what really mattered</a> and make a very informed decision that I can live with. I am grateful for this.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hands down, her favorite feature is the fireplace. </span><span class="s1">âAnd adding windows on either side,&#8221; she said. âItâs lovely to watch the changes in the season through the windows but have complete privacy.â </span><span class="s1">The experience of a home renovation in Southampton has been positive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She concluded, âIt makes me calm and satiated, confirming that I made the right decisions and that it all turned out as I plannedâI got my dream home with my finances intact.â</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Refreshing an ineffective Harlem kitchen a family has outgrown</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> When AndrÃ©a and her husband purchased an early 1900s four-story brownstone in Harlem, the plan was to rent the top two apartments and live in the 2-bedroom, 2 Â½ bath duplex. For a long time, the place felt âsoooo big.â That is, until the couple started their family. Now, with an 11-year-old son, a 9-year-old daughter, cat, Romeo, and her husbandâs ever-growing record collection, AndrÃ©a said, âIt started feeling claustrophobic.âÂ </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Portrait-11.jpg" alt="Sweeten renovator, Sweeten home renovator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Portrait-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Portrait-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first space in their Harlem home she wanted to tackle: the kitchen. âItâs where I spend a lot of time,â says AndrÃ©a. âIt was so cluttered and dim. I didnât enjoy cooking at all. I remember balancing pans on top of each other while making dinner.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Storage was clearly an issue. âFirst of all, the shelves in our cabinets werenât adjustableâso we couldnât even store cereal boxes or olive oil or anything taller than about eight inches. So we just had a ton of stuff on the counters or on top of the fridge.â</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="oak-kitchen-cabinets-before-renovation"  class="alignnone wp-image-44508 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-Before.jpg" alt="dark kitchen with oak cabinets and hardwood floors and gas cooking range with hood before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Appliances ate into counter space as well. âWe had this massive microwave that took up an entire baking station, so we lost workspace there, too.â And then there was the lighting. âWe had this one dim light that didnât even light up the area by the sink. We always felt like we were working in the dark. And our dishwasher was dying.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The two had an unpleasant experience with a master bath reno 12 years ago (AndrÃ©a says the contractor took their money and disappeared). This time, they posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Harlem kitchen renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that connects homeowners with vetted contractors, and they were immediately impressed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âI felt like the Sweeten contractor we chose offered the best price for the job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His team is very efficient and punctual. Itâs great to have someone show up when they say they will and finish on time!â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>After</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although the same 450-square-footprint was retained, their Harlem kitchen was expanded a few feet by knocking down a wall and opening up space for a bar/counter and pantry.Â </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="contemporary-chandelier-and-hardwood-floorss"  class="alignnone wp-image-44512 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="kitchen with stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors and cabinets with glass doors on either side of window and contemporary chandelier after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides improving storage and lighting, AndrÃ©a knew the look and style she wanted from their kitchen renovation. âIâm from California, and I miss it all the timeâthe weather, the sky, the ocean. So I picked colors that reminded me of my hometown of Morro Bay and also the Bay area, where I went to college,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I liked the idea of gray cabinets. My mom recently did her kitchen in all white, and after two years, it was already showing use. It seemed impractical with two kids.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The gray stock cabinets reminded her of fog around the ocean (âa win-winâ). And the paint, kind of a peach color, was like sunsetsââa soothing combination.âÂ  Even the grout color between white subway tiles has a little peach in it. She felt a quartz countertop was a nice balance.Â </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-with-stainless-steel-appliances"  class="alignnone wp-image-44514 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-5.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and gas cooking range with hood and hardwood floors after renovation" width="1000" height="665" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Andrea-Kitchen-5-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AndrÃ©a loves tea, and she has some beautiful blue Fortnum and Mason (a brand based in London) tins, which also reinforced the blue accents. âItâs kind of Jamaica-meets-Miami-meets-Cali-meets-London,â she says.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AndrÃ©a says that their contractorâs wife, Suzy, also helped make sure everything went smoothly.Â </span><span class="s1">âSuzy was a godsend,â says Andrea. âWe had a pretty firm budget and I felt like she worked very hard to stay in it without pushing for more expensive stuff or using cheap things. It was a very nice middle ground.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the result? A huge success. âI love the whole feel of (the new space),â says AndrÃ©a. âThe colors are really inviting, and the cabinets make it feel bigger, even though itâs basically the same square footage. Of course, the kitchen is so beautiful, now we want to update everything in the house!â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> âI love my undercabinet lighting,â she says. âIt wasnât originally in the plans. It was an addition during the reno that has made a huge difference. Alsoâmy hidden recycling bins!â</span></p>

			<h2>A guide for converting these classic Chicago multi-family homes into single-family dwellings</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58040 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chicago-2-3-flat-buildings-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If youâre searching for a single-family home in Chicago, availability and price may be a stumbling block, especially in some parts of the city. But there is another option. Take a look at two or three-flats. Consider a deconversion, where a multi-family building is converted into a multistory, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family home</a>. We outline</span><span class="s1"> what you should know about making a multi-family your very own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors share their insights on what they&#8217;re seeing on the remodeling front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Avondale, Lincoln Park, Logan Square, Lakeview, and Andersonville there is an abundance of multi-family housing stock, with a price range of just under $500,000 to just under $900,000. Many multi-family homes, typically built between 1900 and 1920, are brick or Greystone, and have two or three stories, with an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/chicago-condo-remodel-of-a-fixer-upper-new-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment on each floor</a>. There&#8217;s often a bay in the front and rear porch with exterior stairs on the back and an unfinished basement or garden apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Whatâs the advantage of deconverting a multi-family home?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neighborhood is the main attraction. Potential homeowners may already rent there and like it or are attracted to schools, shopping, and the overall architectural âfeelâ and mix of a streetscape or area.</span></p>
<h3>What makes a good candidate for deconversion?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, says Sweeten general contractor Ryan, the bones of a two- or three-flat will be good for deconversion, especially in brick construction. Another <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/remodeling-old-house-vintage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advantage is that older buildings</a> often have original woodwork, crown moldings, hardwood flooring, and features like fireplaces, in addition to plaster walls.</span></p>
<h3>How long does it take?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months is an average time frame for deconverting a multi-family home. If thereâs a garden apartment, some homeowners opt to live in it <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the construction</a>.</span></p>
<h3>Whatâs involved and whatâs an average cost?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That depends on the condition of the building. If youâre lucky, thereâs little to do on the exteriorâunless windows or skylights are being added, roof repaired or replaced. In the simplest deconversion, itâs a matter of reconfiguring space, some gutting, rerouting, or adding in new plumbing and electrical. Be sure to work with <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the right general contractor</a> who is licensed, insured, and up-to-date with local codes and regulations. You&#8217;ll want to meet and compare estimates from at least three <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in your area</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âA typical multi-family deconversion project will include opening the first floor, building out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new kitchen along with its costs</a>, replacing the second-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor kitchen with a master suite,â says Ryan. The cost is similar to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole-house remodel</a>, so a mid-range two-flat deconversion is around $250,000. But for smaller buildings, say around 2,500 square feet, the work can be done for under $100,000.</span></p>

<h3>Opening up the first floor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Chicago city lots are 25 by 125 feet. Most two- and three-flats have a load-bearing wall that runs the length of the building, which chops up the layout and minimizes the size of rooms. Removing that wall to maximize space requires shoring up, which can be accomplished by several means, such as sistering floor joists.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âThatâs not a disadvantage to scare you off of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/renovating-design-trends-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designing a home</a>,â says <span style="color: #333333;">Sweeten contractor Ryan</span>. âAnd itâs not a significant cost when youâre talking about gaining more living space.âÂ </span></p>
<h3>Expanding the kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-midwest/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning for an upgraded kitchen</a>, these rooms are in the back in most buildings; so borrowing space from smaller rooms allows for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion of the kitchen&#8217;s</a> footprint. For example, some old buildings have enclosed back porches that can be opened up. Reorienting and combining spaces usually requires taking walls down to the studs and planning for updated appliances.Â </span></p>
<h3>Reconfiguring the second floor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a master bedroom suite, which includes a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new or existing bathroom</a> and a walk-in closet, is a top priority. There may also be an existing sitting room, which doubles as a family room. One large or two small bedrooms with a bath also suit the plan.</span></p>
<h3>Moving stairs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are two separate entries, with two sets of stairs, one obviously needs to go. The other set might be retainedâor rebuilt in a new location. Porch or fire stairs on the backside of the structure are often removed. If the foundation is good, that space might be incorporated into the first and second-floor plans. On the first floor, that could mean extra room for the kitchen, or perhaps a breakfast room. On the second level, extra square footage might translate into a master sitting room.</span></p>
<h2><b>Finishing a basement</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the plan is to make your <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/basement/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement a living space</a>, older buildings typically have a ceiling height under eight feet. However, the ceiling can be raised eight to 10 inches without underpinning; that is, excavating beneath the existing foundation and pouring new footings, which is a necessity when raising a foot or more. This usually is done by lowering the floor down to the footingsâwhich can be as much as 12 inchesâthen pouring a new concrete floor. Buffing, staining, and polishing that concrete may be a more cost-effective solution than installing high-quality vinyl tile, carpeting, or engineered hardwood.Â </span></p>
<h3>Toxic materials</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With older buildings, launching into any major alteration can result in unanticipated costs. Sometimes there are happy surprisesâlike finding beautiful pocket doors that have been buried in walls. But with any structure more than 50 years old, there may be toxic or health-threatening materials that are dangerous when not properly removed. Paint containing lead, for example, needs to be stripped carefully. Asbestos is another material that may be present in pre-1980 insulation and ceiling tiles as well as older linoleum flooring and vinyl tile backings. To remove it requires encapsulation (sealing the surface to prevent fibers from becoming airborne) according to EPA standards.</span></p>
<h2><b>HVAC systems</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With two or more apartments designed for multiple families, infrastructure is in place. There will be as many heating and/or cooling systems. Depending on age, they may need to be replaced to improve efficiency. Here are the average lifespans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furnaces: 15 &#8211; 20 years. Consider two furnaces that are zoned for efficiency and energy savings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central air conditioning units: 10 &#8211; 15 years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot water heaters: 7 &#8211; 10 years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tankless water heaters: 20 years</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading electrical and plumbing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buildings more than 50 years old probably are candidates for upgrading mechanicals. If thereâs not already a 200 amp service in place, this is an obvious upgrade. Depending on how high end the project is, and how many electrical systems, devices, smart lighting, and dimmers there are, you might consider a 400 amp service. Even if you didnât need this much power, planning for the futureâwith a $3,000-$4,000 additional costâmay be more cost-effective.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plumbing may need to be upgraded with the addition of fixtures and new plumbing lines for a second sink or a second-floor tub or shower. New sewer and water systems can range between $15,000 and $25,000 but are necessary when adding fixtures and will also boost pressure.Â </span></p>
<h3>Adding insulation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe try not to touch plaster walls,â says Ryan. âItâs a big expense. But plaster also is well-insulating in temperature and sound. Spray foam is used in areas where itâs undesirable to remove walls.â</span></p>
<h3>Flooring</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Original hardwood flooring can be sanded and re-stained, or damaged boards may be replaced; which is necessary to transition between rooms that have been eliminated. With standard 2 Â½ inch-wide oak flooring, itâs pretty easy to match. Even maple, sometimes found in older properties, can be matched.</span></p>
<p>Deconverting a multi-family home into a single home is an undertaking that leads you to even more square footage of living. Understand and plan for all of the elements and be sure to have the right renovation team supporting your vision.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43048 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SWEETEN_Aimee_Apt14a.jpg" alt="HOA" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SWEETEN_Aimee_Apt14a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SWEETEN_Aimee_Apt14a-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SWEETEN_Aimee_Apt14a-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So youâve fallen for a condo with a fabulous city, water or beach view. The floor plan and square footage suit your needs and the price is right. What else do you need to know?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One huge factor that may even impact securing a mortgage is the cost of monthly fees associated with a Homeowners Association. Here, Sweeten outlines the important elements to consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before you purchase</a> an HOA property.Â </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is an HOA?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">High-rise ownership means sharing in the maintenance of common areas and all those amenities you loveâswimming pool, green space, exercise rooms, etc. Whether itâs a condo, co-op, or townhome thatâs part of a complex, all homeowners who buy in become members of their buildingâs Homeowners Association.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a board, typically made up of 5 to 15 residents elected by owners, to govern the rules and regulations (specifically, CC &amp; R or Covenants, or Conditions and Restrictions), usually for a two-year term. This group of directors meets annually, with some meetings throughout the year, open to homeowners except for voting. The board assesses budgets, services, any business that involves day-to-day operations, and making sure that established rules and regulations are met.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal of an overall yearly plan is to decide how much monthly HOA fees (aka assessments) need to be in order to cover expenses.Â  Part of the expense is a property management fee as well as salaries for on-site personnel, like a building manager, assistant, engineer, and cleaning crew. The HOA also is a sounding board for issues homeowners may have, either in the building or surrounding neighborhoods.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>HOA fees, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fees range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. This depends on the age and size of the building (how many units), amenities and total expenditures, prorated according to the size of the apartmentsâstudio, one, two or three or more bedrooms, with the largest at the top end of the sliding scale. Also factored in are particular unit features like larger balconies, private penthouse roof decks, and parking spaces.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âBy law, Iâm required to list capital expenditures for the next two years,â says one condo manager in Chicagoâs South Loop. That requires keeping tabs of utility prices and expected hikes as well as phone and cable charges, with periodic negotiatingâin one case, that saved almost $100,000 and significantly upped the buildingâs internet speed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While fees sometimes stay static, they usually rise yearly, sometimes up to 4 percent or more. Also, unexpected city hikes, such as an 8 percent water increase, are difficult to anticipate. Your HOA fee is a constant, just like property taxes. Your home may be foreclosed by the association, if you donât pay..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do HOA fees cover?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HOA fees generally are part of monthly assessments, which basically address what it costs to maintain common areas. Here is what they may cover depending on your buildingâs property:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vacuuming and cleaning in lobbies, hallways, and mailrooms, and general building maintenance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Trash pick-up (by the city or private companies).<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For buildings with pools, thereâs cleaning and maintenance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">For green areas, there may be landscaping contractors who keep an eye on planters so they donât leak, water plants (either by hand or with an irrigation system), and weed on a regular basis.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Garages are power washed, usually at least twice a year, to maintain the membrane of the concrete floor, limiting deterioration.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Property management fee and on-staff salaries, as well as insurance and a reserve account.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Before you buy, what you need to know about HOAs</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if everything seems perfect about your prospective home, itâs crucial to check out the financial health of the building, just as you might examine all the mechanicals and exterior components of a single-family home. Meet the management and ask questions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Itâs a good idea to consult with a real estate lawyer (even better, one who specializes in HOAs) to take a look at the history of assessments over the course of the last 5 to 10 years. How many raises have there been, and what is the percentage of those raises? Check for any red flags. One could be an unusual number of apartments for sale at a given time. Or special assessmentsâwhat they were for, how much they were. Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point. Some associations will set aside at least $50,000 each year for the what-ifs. Owners obviously donât want to see assessments rise. âBut,â says one manager, âwhat if the gas contract goes up a lot? What kind of electricity contract has been negotiated?Â  What if union or non-union paying health benefits rise? It has to be run like a business,â with an eye on the bottom line and ever-changing rates, just like the cost of living.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If thereâs a major breakdownâa roof, a boiler, an elevator issue, and thereâs not enough in reserves, youâll get hit up with a special assessment. Some condos hire attorneys or specialists to lobby for lowering property taxes. That might translate to a one-time monthly upcharge, like $75. But a major issue, like a burst pipe or a mechanical issue with an elevator, can mean big bucks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Is it sustainable?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may also have concerns about sustainability, energy-saving, and using eco-friendly materials. Many buildings are switching to longer-lasting LEDs, which will cut down on costs. Some buildings use enzyme and plant-based cleaning products, organic materials for flower and community herb gardens, and stay away from harsh chemical treatments for weeds. Pet-friendly buildings also are mindful of keeping snow off of sidewalks with salt that doesnât harm paws.Â </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How do you work with an HOA?</b></span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>If you want to rent out your unit: </b>This<b> </b>really falls under rules and regulations and some buildings have taken a stricter stance against rentals, because of Airbnb. Many now require long-term contracts with a minimum of six months, and the prospective renters need to be thoroughly vetted, with references and credit histories. Liability is a serious issue.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>While remodeling: </b>So, about that kitchen? The cabinets and countertops really arenât your style. The appliances need updating, and so do the sink and faucet.<b><br />
</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if you had a contractor ready to start tomorrow, that probably canât happen. Why?</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">First, you need the approval of the HOA. That means you need a written game plan, detailing everything that is proposed. Spell out the kinds of cabinetry youâll use, appliances, floor covering, backsplash and counter material, electrical and plumbing plans. In many instances, you canât change the site of plumbing. There are some restrictions on materials. With flooring, there might be sound considerations (with a baffling subfloor for tile, for example), so you need to ask. Familiarize yourself with rules and regs before you hire an architect or contractor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Hire a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed general contractor</a>. A general contractor will have licensed and insured plumbers, electricians on board, tile and counter installers (or people they work with), plus painters, so you can source all through one person. The contractor needs proof of licensing, bonding and insurance, and generally needs to add your condo building address to that insurance. The reason for this is if something goes south in a major way, not only will you be sued, but so will the building for not doing due diligence.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the board reviews your proposal and sees no red flags, youâll be given approval. This may take some time. Obviously, you need to coordinate time for work, respecting other homeowners by sticking to daytime work, limiting noise as much as possible. Also, freight elevators must be reserved in advance for deliveries of larger items like appliances and cabinetry.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The bottom line with HOAs</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, HOA fees can hugely impact your bottom line, as you need to factor in assessments along with mortgage payments, utilities you are responsible for (electrical, phone/cable, for example), your own property insurance, as well as property taxes. With the right research and proper planning, you can be on your way to finding the right home with a sound Homeowners Association to work with.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="exterior-old-tudor-brick-home" class="alignnone wp-image-42385 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior of old tudor red brick home with white fence and lawn" width="1000" height="692" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Exterior-300x208.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Exterior-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">You chose that turn-of-the-century Victorian, â20s beach bungalow, or mid-century modern ranch for its character. But those &#8220;so 1980s&#8221; oak and laminate cabinetsâyikes! A sunroom or extra bedroom </span><span class="s3">and bath</span><span class="s2"> would be amazing. Seriously, the old house needs a remodeling reboot to make it more livable for today. Itâs worth it when its great bones spark Ã¼ber potential.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">You donât have to take off those rose-colored glasses, but thereâs much you need to know if youâre about to embark on a major reno.Â </span><span class="s2">Sometimes it means taking everything down to the studs or a homeâs skeleton. And what is unseenâelectrical wiring, plumbing pipes, heating and cooling ducts as well as insulationâare key to making sure everything runs efficiently and safely. Because there are so many unknowns when you open up walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donât even think about DIY. Hire professionals.Â </a></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Is your house or neighborhood historic?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If the house is 50 years old or more, and there are enough strong original architectural features, you may want to preserve them and/or replace elements like crown moldings when you can closely replicate the design. A general contractor can guide you on replacing, salvaging, or repairing these details. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Houses that have historic landmark status (national, state, or local) also benefit from some tax breaks. But that historic designation may limit changes you can makeâespecially on the exterior. If there are double-hung windows on the original faÃ§ade, for example, you canât replace them with picture windows. Even paint colors and hardware may be restricted. If youâre remodeling in a historic district, architectural style is in play.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Chicago, landmark homes and districts are governed by an ordinance with rules and regulations detailing what can and cannot be done. Repairing existing window sashes and frames, for example, is preferred to replacing. But if windows need to be replaced, they must match in style, material, glass size, muntins (dividers), profile, and trims.Â </span><span class="s1">Aluminum, vinyl, or other siding materials would not be suitable to substitute for wood clapboard. In brick construction, replacement with materials as close as possible to the original is advocated.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Types of home additions</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">The footprint and square footage of the existing old houseâand how much lot space you have around it, in the back, or to one sideâdetermine how much you can add on. There are formulas in local zoning laws that calculate buildable space, with setbacksâhow close to the front of the lot and neighboring property lines the building can be placed. Here are your options.Â </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s4"><b>Add space by building out</b></span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Expand a kitchen and create a family room and/or breakfast room<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Adding a sunroom or screened porch are popular options for the first story<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Note: For ground floor additions, youâll need a new foundation and footings.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s4"><b>Build up or down</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">If you donât have enough space to build out, you can build upon or create a new second story, or convert at the basement level. Check what your local zoning allows, based on total square footage of the property, and an equation that allows for the structure.Â Â </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">For a master suite or more bedrooms and baths, you might build up by expanding an existing attic or adding a story or two.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">Blowing out the roof and adding structural supports such as trusses also requires replacing the roof.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s6">A basement offers even more livable space. If the ceiling is below eight feet, consider</span><span class="s2"> underpinning, digging out and pouring new foundation and footings.Â Don&#8217;t forget the basement also needs to be kept free of moisture.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While converting two-flats to single-family dwellings may be less expensive than building new, plumbing pipes and wiring may need to be rerouted (eliminating one kitchen for example, or relocating baths). In addition, interior staircases may need to be relocated with structural reinforcement needed when loadbearing walls are removed.</span></p>
<h3>Improve the floor plan</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Older homes often have floor plans that just donât work for today, with too small or chopped-up rooms. Sometimes itâs simply a matter of reconfiguring existing space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Today, kitchens can spill into family/entertaining rooms, and include eat-in spaces at large islands or breakfast rooms. Powder room additions also serve this multifunctional space making it easily accessible for family and guests instead of climbing to another floor.Â </span>Old houses like townhouse or Tudors often didn&#8217;t have first-floor bathrooms. Other modern amenities include having a washer and dryer closer to the bedrooms upstairs or converting the basement into a guest suite.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If load-bearing walls are removed, existing water, gas pipes, ductwork, and electrical wiring may need to be rerouted. Some kind of bracing, like ceiling beams and/or vertical supports, will be required.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>Updating house mechanicals</b></span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Electrical</b>âOne 100 amp circuit box may not be enoughâespecially if there are only a few slots left to upgrade electricity to accommodate heavier duty appliances, more lights, and a new HVAC, which add to the load of amps and circuits. A homeowner&#8217;s call to a professional electrician for an audit or inspection will help determine what needs to be upgraded (like adding GCFIs). They can reach out to the city for a sign-off. At least one 200 amp capacity electrical panel will probably be necessary. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">The <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20190521124726/Philadelphia_Rowhouse_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Rowhouse Manual</a> states that if a circuit or fuse box trips frequently, consult an electrician and PECO toÂ find the source of the overload and upgrade your service instead of replacing the breaker or fuse with one that carries greater capacity.<br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>Plumbing</b>âThe addition of bathrooms, tubs, showers, and even extra sinks may not only require the relocation of pipes, but it may call attention to existing water pressure in the home. Amping up the supply line from the main sewer to your home isnât inexpensive, but it will assure a good flow of water throughout the home.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In older homes, itâs also a good idea to make sure there is no lead in the pipes, valves, or faucets.Â </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The age of the existing hot water heater determines whether or not it needs to be replaced. Consider high-efficiency tankless heaters: they take up less space and are more efficient, as they supply hot water on demand.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s2"><b>HVAC</b>âDepending on the age of the heating and cooling systems, you may want to replace units for more efficiency.Â  Sizing is calculated according to square footage; sometimes two or more furnaces and air conditioners are needed. Make sure ducts are insulated. Zoning spaces also is a good idea, so that you can shut down areas of the house that may not be used all the time.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Boosting energy efficiency</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Many old homes are <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not at all well insulated</a>, which can create drafty situations as well as severely impact heat loss. Take into consideration the age of the roof and be sure this space is in good shape.Â </span><span class="s2">There are several <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/insulation/home-energy-efficiency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ways to add insulation</a> to an attic or to walls. Insulation is based onÂ  R-values (thermal resistance). Naturally, the higher the R-value, the better (the highest number is 45, rated on vacuum-insulated panels). For NYC historic rowhouses, an energy auditor can test for a home&#8217;s energy efficiency. The Municipal Art Society of New York <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/lpc/downloads/pdf/pubs/Manual%20-%20Greening%20Rowhouses%20-%202012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advises to first consider</a> less invasive wall or roof repairs before adding insulation or other extensive work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Types of insulation</b>Â </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Fiberglass is predominantly found in most homes. It comes as batt and rolls or loose-fill and is fire retardant.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Cellulose insulation is an older type of insulation typically blown-in packing into wall cavities and conforms to the structure itâs insulating.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Injection foam is a shoot-in insulation and the most expensive. Itâs fire-rated and doesnât retain water.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Replace windows</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Consider replacing windows with Energy Star-qualified ones. All wood, vinyl, aluminum clad with wood inside, and fiberglass are some options. Important features to look for:Â </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Low-E, or Low-Emissivity, with metallic coatings that allow windows to reflect rather than absorb heat<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Double or triple panes<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s2">Gas-filled (argon or krypton gas) between glazed layers to improve heat insulation and slow heat transfer<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s2">Preserving wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sometimes underneath the wall-to-wall carpeting, youâll luck out and find original hardwood. Tack holes can be sanded out and the floors refinished. Yellowing, which often occurs with natural polyurethane finishes due to sunlight exposure or water damage, is easy to fix with sanding and refinishing. If the boards are too blackened and youâre not using a dark stain, they need to be replaced, as do warped boards. Â </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">While the whole process may be challenging, fixing any issues and fortifying the inner workings of the house will help abate surprises down the road. And then you can look around youâeverything is just as you imagined! Youâre soooo happy. Toast your efforts. You deserve it.</span></p>
