<p><em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Dara</em></p>
<h3>Figuring out the best layout for the apartment</h3>
<p>Our building was originally constructed in 1930, possibly for officers of the Navy Yard located several blocks north. Like many buildings in NYC, it turned into a co-op in the &#8217;80s. The overall layout of the apartment was great, with a lot of natural light, but the configuration of the space in both bathrooms, as well as the kitchen, was awkward.</p>
<p>Mauricio, an architect, and I wanted to open up the kitchen so that all four of us, including our 5-year-old twins, could move around it comfortably while adding counter space and enlarging the existing island. But solving that problem was really challenging. We must have gone through at least ten different layouts.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We discussed everything from a standard galley kitchen layout, to relocating the gas line and stove,</span><span class="s2"> but nothing felt quite right. Then we said, &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">hat if we extend the kitchen by taking a bit of space away from the adjacent</span><span class="s2"> dining room?&#8221; Ultimately, we realized that by </span><span class="s1">moving the fridge and aligning it with an enlarged island,</span><span class="s2"> we could seamlessly expand the kitchen </span><span class="s1">without sacrificing room for our dining table</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p>The kitchen remodel worked, and now we have a much bigger kitchen with a lot more storage and prep space. We even have huge cabinets underneath our island. Most importantly, our dining room is still perfectly roomy.</p>

<h3>Renovation tip to help save time</h3>
<p>We planned for minimal construction and maximum impact.  The access point <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the washer and dryer</a> was moved from the master bedroom to the third bedroom by easily rotating it in its existing space, rather than relocating it. That way, you don’t need to walk through the master to do a load of laundry. It also allowed us a larger shower.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We opened up the “den” off the living room</span><span class="s2"> by removing built-ins along three walls </span><span class="s1">to create a more flexible space as a TV room and an office</span><span class="s2">. We saved money and time tailoring modular closets to our needs rather than building out new closets. </span>Non-layout items we needed to address included fixing the electric panel and installing new hardwood floors since the original wood was as thin as the veneer.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, we kept in mind our 3 R&#8217;s mantra: Things needed to be easily <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repairable, replaceable, or recyclable</a>. Most of our purchases were made from local stores that had minimum to no lead time. We chose not to do anything custom until our kids stopped sharing a bedroom when they get older; we might need to rethink some of the spaces.</p>

<h3>Compromising on style</h3>
<p>In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences. I chose a more eclectic style in the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles. In the master bathroom, Mauricio preferred a more streamlined and minimalist look with grays and whites with a floating white glossy vanity.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the kitchen cabinets, we went with Ikea, that we could upgrade to semi-custom later on. We wanted solid hardwood that was reminiscent in the color of the original floor, but more modern looking. We chose a white oak in wide planks.</p>
<h3>A good-working Sweeten reno team</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor and his dad made a great team. He was very easy to talk to, and his dad was quite resourceful, with many solutions for various problems we encountered along the way. We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through. We could debate different ideas with him, but he was never pushy or non-communicative.</p>
<h3>Avoiding subcontractor issues</h3>
<p>One thing we would do differently is to put all of the renovation items (except finishes) under the contractor umbrella. We bought our countertop slabs from a local store, which encouraged us to use their fabricator rather than using our contractor to oversee the subcontractors. At installation, there were problems with sizing and fit. The fabricator blamed the contractor for moving the kitchen cabinets. Meanwhile, the contractor blamed the fabricator for cutting a countertop that didn’t fit. If the fabricator had been a subcontractor of our contractor, and under his supervision, that would have all been avoided.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re extremely happy with our home. After the full renovation of our apartment, all four of us can have breakfast at the kitchen island with room to spare. Plus, with all of the closets plus the kitchen storage, we finally have enough space to store everything. It all makes us happy on a daily basis. <span class="s1">Now we are gearing up for renovating our rooftop, to create an outdoor space for our family that rivals the interior.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Beth Judge. </em><span class="s1"><i>&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</i></span></p>
<h3>Moving back to the city</h3>
<p>We relocated back to Manhattan several years ago after residing in the Midwest and South for work. It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes—a few we had renovated—so we weren’t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we started the buying phase</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44562" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early ‘90s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.</p>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn’t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif" alt="closet turn home office" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It’s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A/C bills. And it’s a plus in a prewar building where you can’t regulate the heat in winter.  We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.</span></p>
<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room—we love books and are avid readers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="stainless steel kitchen counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle</h3>
<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a “say” in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten as the backstop</a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. </span><span class="s1">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly. </span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.  Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting and getting product delivered in time</a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It’s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!</span></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45098 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45113 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Yonkers family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Portrait-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>
<div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg" alt="Bertazzoni stove" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45106" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen storage ideas" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45100" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Balancing the kitchen structures</h3>
<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Brown drip dishware" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-45099 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="wainscot bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45093 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Bathroom-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="s1">We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Our house addition plan: Envisioning more space</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I found a place that needed work and left me with some budget to renovate. It was challenging to work full-time and oversee the renovation. I tried to keep things simple. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal for my home was to feel peaceful and light, but I had a pretty tight budget for all that I wanted to accomplish. I focused on fairly humble materials for the renovation that I really liked and how to use them expanding on traditional neutral colors. Work is always visually intensive for me and I wanted a minimal, quiet space to serve as a backdrop for art and objects.</span></p>

<h3>Navigating the renovation plan</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve seen many projects through construction in my professional career. However, it never personally affected my life before. The biggest challenge was: would I be able to figure out the design of the space, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a>, and complete the work in the short window I had before I would have to move in? I ended up having to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move into a construction site</a>. It was a lot to have workers show up every morning and not have a kitchen for many weeks. But you forget the hardships quickly once it’s done and you’re enjoying living there. Thankfully, my partner, at the time, and I were able to help each other through it. He has great taste and helped me the whole way through.</span></p>

<h3>Planning a mixed-materials kitchen</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mixing wood and laminate as finishes for the cabinetry was an important idea when I was planning the renovation. It emphasizes the volumes and makes the scale a little more human. The countertops and peninsula are concrete, which I like because the material can take any form. However, it&#8217;s also a natural material for a renovation that weathers over time.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ve always liked appliance garages. It goes back to the fact that my grandparents had one in their very modern kitchen from the &#8217;60s. </span></p>

<h3>Renovating two bathrooms</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was especially excited about the new bathrooms and having a tub to soak in with a smoked glass panel. From the beginning, I knew the partition would not be clear glass. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44925" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="colored shower glass" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44926" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the other bathroom, the general idea was to make a very small space feel as big and open as possible. The renovation materials are pretty simple, but the details and extra showerhead make it feel more special.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44923" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="double showerheads" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44924" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>A Murphy bed and storage</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the guest bedroom/office, the millwork is a combination of knotty pine and laminate, with a painted wood frame. The red laminate panel breaks up the finish and calls attention to the sliding door. They are both closets and shoe storage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45036 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Matthew-Closet-Bed-22.gif" alt="renovation materials of laminate panel and Murphy bed" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I made the open shelving in the hallway myself using laminated pieces of reclaimed wood. In a way, it’s the heart of the apartment. I knew I wanted to find a spot for these shelves and the hall was just the right fit. </span><span class="s1">It turns a slice of space that wasn’t so usable into a place for display.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Closet-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Plants were always an important component. All of the artwork is from friends and acquaintances or people in my community.</span></p>
<h3>A successful partnership with my general contractor</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor was instrumental in completing the project and helping me do all of the things I wanted to do. At the outset, I got a lot of high bids. He was the one who convinced me it could be done within my budget. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He helped me find the millworker who did all the cabinetry. I did all the designs and drawings for them and selected all the finishes. A Murphy bed kit was purchased online and my contractor built the frame, the custom panels, and installed it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Start your renovation</span></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44943" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-MasterBedroom-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I highly recommend working with design professionals. It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved. And don’t get too hung up on specific choices, sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like and move on. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1.jpg" alt="bookshelf hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44934" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Matthew-Hallway-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My new home makes me feel happy and relaxed, and it helps me focus. Living in the space has forced me to declutter and live more simply. And it’s been a good exercise to direct interests for future projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tina and Andrew combined two closets in the master bedroom into a walk-in closet—“a rare thing in New York City!”—they opted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include a jewelry wall</a> that functioned as a unique feature for display and storage. The narrow shelf underneath adds a subtle component that provides space for decorative touches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siblings Deanna and Daria share a Grandmillenial-chic aesthetic, so it’s only fitting that <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even their jewelry wall</a> is hidden behind an old-school mirrored door. Inside, there’s plenty of room for statement necklaces, earrings, and rings, in keeping with the sisters’ more-is-more sensibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elie and Matt waited before <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating their kitchen</a> to make sure that they could fully maximize the 7&#215;7 space to suit their needs. When they decided to take the leap, they opted for custom cabinets that included toe-kick drawers as unique features to get more storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica and Jesse, both major foodies, knew they needed a “beautiful kitchen to cook in.” To that end, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-engineered the space</a> to incorporate a six-foot island with a lot of cool features, and toe-kick drawers are one of the stars.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Giulia’s plan for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a “functional” kitchen</a>, she knew she wanted a drying rack shelf above the sink, an idea she says she “stole” from Italy, her home country. The rack’s placement not only frees up counter space; it prevents the dreaded “puddles of standing water.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jo’s kitchen renovation aimed to create <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/product-designer-sutton-place-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clean, classic space</a> while incorporating ideas from her travels and innovative materials. A bamboo drying rack above the sink—something Jo had seen in Europe—was sealed to accommodate wet dishes and provides an earthy counterpoint to the white cabinetry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Nazli’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-plan kitchen</a>, she opted to forgo upper cabinets, a storage challenge she solved with an open pantry. Although a great solution for seeing and accessing ingredients easily, it can also lead to visual clutter. Nazli avoided that pitfall by painting the pantry a dark gray, which “makes the whole space disappear” once the light is turned off.</span></p>

<h3>Compact living in a junior one bedroom</h3>
<p>Dan and I lived on the Lower East Side for several years in typical rental apartments—tiny, no living rooms, dated kitchens and baths, and windows looking into someone else’s kitchen. In NYC real estate terms, this translates into “cozy!” We’re not big fans of moving, so purchasing an apartment together was always on our minds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Often, we’d walk past our current apartment building and joke about purchasing a studio there if we could find a relatively cheap unit to gut-renovate. Somehow this apartment showed up in an internet search and met our expectations, so we decided to buy it. We closed on the purchase but lived in our old apartment while the renovations were in progress.</p>

We knew it would need a complete overhaul. Our primary goal was some separation between the living/kitchen area and the sleeping space. We wanted it to feel less like a studio and more like a junior one bedroom.</p>

<h3>Making a junior one bedroom work</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of Department of Building regulations, our architect said we couldn’t install full walls to divide the space. After a brainstorm with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect</a> and our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor, we decided to install custom sliding doors fabricated by a vendor. The doors allow us to keep the space open, but we can close them when we have overnight guests or just want some privacy. Though it was challenging to figure out the right door dimensions and make sure the ceiling was even, I think it was a smart investment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44583 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In addition, we wanted to remove the wall between the kitchen and the living space, fully renovate the kitchen and bathroom, and install new hardwood floors throughout. Fun—not fun—story: we ordered a new toilet online, and it came broken three times in a row. We were only able to get it in one piece when we picked it up at the store.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44581" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg" alt="Lower East Side renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Claire-entrance-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Simple color palette for a small space</h3>
<p>Given the apartment’s small size, I used a limited material palette and color scheme—sort of a mix of Scandinavian, Japanese, and Lower East Side flavors. We went with white kitchen cabinets and tiles, chrome, black hardware, and a red oak floor. My favorite part of the renovation was picking materials and envisioning how each would look in the space. It was hard to find things I liked that fit our limited budget! However, I incorporated interesting textures and colors through decoration and furnishings so it wouldn’t feel too clinical.</p>

<h3>The right contractor for a first-time renovator</h3>
<p>My contractor was resourceful in accommodating our various needs and provided honest recommendations on what was feasible or not. For example, having a soaking tub in the bathroom was very important for Dan since he loves taking baths. Our bathroom door was tiny, so we weren&#8217;t sure how the tub would actually get in. Our contractor figured out how to open up the closet wall next to the bathroom and inserted the tub that way.</p>

<h4>Sweeten lends advice and support</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciated that the Sweeten team was approachable and knowledgeable about my first-timer renovator questions. The team hopped on a call to discuss potential contractors and provided useful tips on how to make the hiring decision. They also frequently checked in during the renovation and were available for help as needed.  </span></p>
<h3>Renovation tips: Budget and expectations</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating—even for a junior one bedroom—plan on it taking more time and money than you anticipate—there are always unexpected things that happen as you go through the process. We ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget since we added change orders to address issues that came up. Decide on your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” and stick with them. It’s a dusty business, so live somewhere else during a gut renovation, if possible, and invest in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air purifier and a professional cleaning</a> afterward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t feel pressured to decorate everything right after you move in. Be patient, live with the apartment for a while with existing items, and figure out what you need. Also, buy vintage furniture if you can! </span><span class="s1">Now our new space finally feels like home :) </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Claire and Dan, for sharing your very first renovation with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Martha, who works in preschool special education, first saw the Hamilton Heights co-op in upper Manhattan she would eventually buy, she passed because it needed a lot of work. She continued looking, searching for a permanent space to share with her daughter, Sofia, a 4th grader. But after a year and no luck, when her realtor encouraged her to take another look, a lightbulb went off. No longer daunted, Martha embraced the possibilities of the apartment’s pre-war flourishes, including 10-foot ceilings, french doors, and transom windows.</i></span></p>

<h3>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Martha</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were living in a great apartment nearby for four years. But after my divorce, I knew I needed to find something to purchase in order to control my housing costs. Since I’m a full-time, working, single parent, the more I can get my costs under control, the better off we’ll be in the long term.<b> </b>I had an amazing real estate agent who looked at places in my price range for a full year.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The apartment I ended up buying was the first home I saw when I started my search! But it needed so much work that I automatically said no and we moved on. After my realtor encouraged me to take another look, I saw it with new eyes. I saw the potential in it, and not just the work that needed to be done.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the biggest challenges was that I had a tight timeline—I was paying rent along with a mortgage plus maintenance, and I couldn’t afford that for long. So I had to use only <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials that were in stock</a>. It was limiting, but I think we made do! I wanted to open things up and make a home that was cozy and colorful, that would reflect our personalities and be welcoming.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>

<div><span class="s1">The first few days during the demo were the best part of the process, because I could finally see what things were really going to look like.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The highest priority with the renovation was to cure the ugliness! The apartment hadn’t been touched since the &#8217;70s. There was fake wood paneling in the hallways, old linoleum plunked down over the amazing original hardwood floors, and layers and layers of paint. The space was tight and there was a lot of wasted space in the kitchen that I wanted to find a way to utilize.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first few days during the demo were the best part of the process, because I could finally see what things were really going to look like. I was most excited to take down the wall between the kitchen and the living room. It made all the difference in creating an open, warm area. Once we knocked that down, it gave us space for a table and chairs that we wouldn’t have otherwise. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation-red hardware-stainless steel sink-gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, we installed new custom cabinets, plus more cabinets next to the stove. I went for a 30-inch stainless-steel farmer’s sink, quartz countertops, and a new stove. My favorite thing in the whole house is the kitchen backsplash; I love that funky design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My contractor really wanted me to lay a new floor on top of the old one. But I loved the color variation in the original wood so I insisted it stay. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kept all the original flooring</a>, just refinished and stained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest challenge was that the apartment has zero closets. I didn’t have the budget to build them so we bought a couple of big wardrobes and a funky metal gym locker for a linen closet and made it work. At least we had more vertical space to work with because after we removed the dropped ceilings, we gained at least two feet!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-french-doors"  class="alignnone wp-image-43715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01.jpg" alt="bedroom with french doors and hardwood floors and fan after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m a first-time renovator, so I really needed someone who would listen, do good work, deliver on time, and stay within budget and I got all of that. My Sweeten contractor was great and I really had no headaches with my renovation, which is amazing! </span><span class="s1">He was really communicative, and anytime something needed to be changed or wasn’t going to work according to plan, he explained everything to me. Then we worked towards solutions together, which was so helpful. It went as smoothly as one could ask for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating, remember that there will inevitably be something or some things that don’t go according to your plan. Try to see the big picture and not freak out about the details.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wanted our forever home to be a place of joy that you can see. Our home makes me feel free.</span></p>

<h3>Two sisters decide to renovate, again</h3>
<p>Prior to our new home, we were living in a smaller apartment in Sutton Place in Manhattan that was renovated and converted from a studio to a one-bedroom. After five years there, we needed more space but wanted to stay in the neighborhood and ideally find something that required some work. We liked creating a space that is uniquely our own and feels like a home.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<h3>The floorplan evens out</h3>
<p>A lot of people are surprised by two millennial siblings, planning a whole apartment remodel, with a traditional style. Our design influence comes from Chinoiserie and a lot of ginger jars! We love bold patterns and color: the only thing painted white is the kitchen ceiling. Our home is filled with antiques we’ve bought and a number of items from our grandmother’s house.</p>

<p>The original layout had changed into a space that wasn&#8217;t well-utilized. The biggest challenge was bringing back the layout to its original form while making tweaks of our own and highlighting the great view. Our main goals were to create a second bedroom, build a large closet for our endless clothes, and have a dining space large enough to fit a table for entertaining. The decor would pull it all together through striking colors, textures, and the cozy feel.</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The entryway closet was a bit of an eyesore. We decided to keep it and make it work in the dining area as a coat/linen closet. We designed the mirrored doors and it became a great way to add extra light and depth to the space.</p>
<p>The size of the master bedroom was cut down to allocate space for a shared 7’x10’ walk-in clothes closet. Storage is super important in a New York apartment so we wanted to make sure we had as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Seeking simplicity with character</h3>
<p>The kitchen stayed simple by choosing white cabinets and a white quartz countertop. We avoided a trendy cabinet style to ensure a classic look for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home value resale</a>. A green, subway tile backsplash, inspired by The Polo Bar, gave a pop of color. All of the fixtures were in a gold finish. The kitchen counter wrapped around and into the dining area with extra cabinets and a wine rack added below it. We like the aesthetics of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43491" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="green tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43493 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>In the bathroom, we went for a standard white subway tile in the shower for resale consideration. It’s inexpensive, easy to maintain, and a classic material that won’t go out of style. Spending less on the subway tile also meant we could spend more on the marble basketweave floor tile, which adds a lot of character.</p>
<p>Initially, we were going to salvage the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floors</a>. When we realized we couldn’t, we had to quickly choose a new style and decided on a medium finish with narrow planks. Wood floors are so classic, you really can’t go wrong, so we weren’t as concerned with getting it just right.</p>
<p>We managed the project while working full-time jobs. We had an idea of what we wanted but the execution for most of it was in real-time. Fortunately, we work very close to home so we were able to run over at lunchtime and after work to answer questions, make decisions, and check on the overall progress.</p>

<h3>The right general contractor communicates</h3>
<p>Constant communication with our Sweeten contractor was key! Although we communicated exactly what we wanted, it’s only natural that things get lost in translation. To keep everyone on the same page, we had weekly calls or meetings to make sure everything was getting done right and on time. We would also send checklists of completed tasks and any pending items.</p>
<p>Choosing the right contractor is the biggest question when starting a project. Having a referral or reputable source (like Sweeten!) is always a good idea. You don’t always have the luxury of starting from scratch where every detail is of your own choosing, especially in New York, so we really wanted to capitalize on that.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to finally have a dining room to sit and have meals (another NYC luxury). The wallpaper, chandelier, and doors were a must, since day one. We feel so happy to be settled and comfortable but are also really proud of how our ideas translated into exactly what we envisioned.</p>
