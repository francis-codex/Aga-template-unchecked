					<description><![CDATA[Mary Ann: These Cooking Capsules are great!  I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve stumbled around a grocery store with recipe in hand trying to figure out what exactly I need to buy, and then getting home and not understanding clearly what the directions are.

Check out this store in Berlin that sells meal capsules, a recipe and instructions along with all the ingredients: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/arts/06iht-koch.html?ref=arts]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled upon this post in a vanity search for my mobile application, &quot;Cooking Capsules&quot; (streamlines cooking by &quot;encapsulating&quot; all the info you need to make a recipe), and I enjoyed the modern kitchen eye candy. The mini kitchen would probably best suit my purposes in my tiny San Francisco space, but the rotating one makes me happy to dream about. Thank you!
