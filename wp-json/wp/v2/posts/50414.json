My Sweeten contractor, who I chose to hire, is a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/meet-sweeten-contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">woman-owned contracting firm<\/a>.

We would also <\/span><span class=\"s1\">improve the lighting by installing new fixtures and switches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">A plumber assessed that the old pipes and a plumbing line<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> would need to be replaced before putting in a new sink and faucet. Those fixes would be particularly essential since I wanted to install a dishwasher for the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50273 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a kitchen with patterned floor tile and blue cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h4>\n<h4><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50278 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a kitchen with brass finish fixtures \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h4>\n<h4>A 180-degree kitchen remodel<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, I felt most excited about the things that were visible. I hoped to find a source for small, good-quality small-sized appliances. I wanted to use Ikea cabinets and replace the countertops and backsplash. We would redo the kitchen top to bottom, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-conversations\/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from refinishing the walls<\/a> and soffits to putting down a new floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This was not my first renovation, but my first time doing a major teardown and remodel. I had a lot of questions about the cabinets and having enough storage space, in addition to the technical updates. My Sweeten contractor helped so much during the planning phase. I asked a lot of questions before we started. She provided great suggestions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Spotlight on compact appliances for small spaces<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The renovation was straightforward: No walls were moved and no layout changes were made. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50276 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a kitchen with brass fixtures and open shelving\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50279 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a renovated kitchen with small stove and pattern floor tile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50282 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-10.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a small kitchen island painted purple\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With this in mind, my biggest choices were the appliances and the cabinets. It was a challenge finding reasonably priced and attractive compact appliances\u2014when you\u2019re looking for 18-, 20- or 24-inch models, choices are limited. I found the dishwasher, but t<\/span><span class=\"s4\">he hood took a long time. I didn&#8217;t want one that stuck out, and anything less than 24 inches seemed nonexistent. When I found this 20-inch model, I ordered it right away\u2014but then it came and we had no idea how to make it ductless! Note to apartment dwellers: A ductless hood, or one that can be adapted with a kit, is what you need. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">By the time I found these items, I\u2019d <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decided to go with custom cabinets<\/a>, to make life easier and maximize space.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> costs.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>A unique blend of color and pattern<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">In addition, with custom cabinets, I had an opportunity to be creative with color.<\/span> <span class=\"s6\">Initially, I\u2019d envisioned light-gray cabinets with wood flooring. Then I changed my mind and<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> looked at patterned vinyl flooring; in the end, I decided to <\/span><span class=\"s6\">totally<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> contrast it to the wood floor in the living area<\/span><span class=\"s6\">. Looking at it with paint chips, a paint color called Brittany Blue\u2014a light gray-blue with a warm-gray undertone\u2014looked best for the cabinets.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> The color wasn\u2019t far from what I had imagined, and it was a really good decision.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">I wanted a gold tone as an accent color, so I chose brass handles for the doors and drawers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">When it came to the island, I got even bolder. I purchased it online and when it came, I didn&#8217;t like the color, so I decided to experiment. I\u2019d seen a photo of a kitchen that had purple cabinets. I remembered it because that color choice was so unusual and didn&#8217;t look dated. Painting that island was a fun project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I chose quartz for the countertops and wanted to continue with the same material for the backsplash. For a small kitchen, it made a lot of sense, especially in terms of budget, since it didn\u2019t cost anything extra to install.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50281 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a renovated kitchen with eat-in nook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50277 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a renovated kitchen with quartz countertop and microwave storage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\">For the lighting, I was less involved than I expected to be. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">I wanted overall lighting and also a fixture above the dining table. My contractor and electrician suggested installing LED lights above the cabinets, which turned out to be my favorite aspect of the renovation. The lights are dimmable, and such an upgrade from just a single ceiling fixture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Good communication\u2014the key to a successful remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\">Throughout the process, I was so happy to have my Sweeten contractor\u2019s input.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> When something on my list cost too much, she always came up with an alternative solution that worked just as well. Also, from the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that\u2019s one reason why it went so smoothly.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten also stayed in touch<\/a> and helped with project flow by checking in periodically. There weren\u2019t any issues, but I liked knowing I had a fallback in case something went wrong. I think I worried less throughout the renovation as a result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The project worked out so well that it\u2019s hard to list just one thing I love about it. I am truly pleased with the new kitchen\u2019s flow, and the look of the whole room tops even what I had hoped it could be. I am really happy with the result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s9\"><i>Thank you for sharing your new kitchen with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Renovation Materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Custom cabinets, Calacatta quartz countertops, backsplash, and sink: Sourced by contractor. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Vinyl floor tiles: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.harveymaria.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvey Maria<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Brass faucet: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kraususa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kraus<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Beko 24<\/span><span class=\"s7\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u2033 refrigerator: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beko.com\/us-en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beko<\/a>. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Bosch 18\u201d dishwasher: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosch-home.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bosch<\/a>. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Avanti 20\u201d<\/span> range: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avantiproducts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Avanti<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Cuna p<\/span><span class=\"s1\">endant light fixture: <a href=\"https:\/\/umage.us\/?switch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Umage<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Island: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wayfair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wayfair<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Paint: Seattle Gray for walls, Brittany Blue for the cabinets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benjamin Moore<\/a>. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s7\">Cabinet handles in brass: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cb2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s8\">CB2<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1 mb-0\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
