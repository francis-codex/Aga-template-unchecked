Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider when planning a major project like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Sweeten<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s involved in a gut home renovation?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, let\u2019s define the term. Gutting a home is more than an extensive remodel. It\u2019s taking the walls down to the studs, removing existing interior doors and trim, cabinets, sinks, and exposing the structure of the home. It often includes replacing windows and exterior doors, the roof, and replacing most or all plumbing and electrical. Gutting is about the material removal before you remodel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A renovation budget overview<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs of materials<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ll find Sweeten\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/category\/renovation-cost-guides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovation cost guides<\/a> here but keep in mind material costs and timelines have shifted. Prices for materials and labor have jumped, drastically in some cases and in some locales. It\u2019s a good idea to add 20% to the materials budget and talk with your contractor about timing, materials, and budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Do not wait. Many sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For homeowners interested in renovating, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices may continue to go up and your material order will be at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">\u201cMust-haves\u201d and \u201cNice-to-haves\u201d lists<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When making your project budget, it\u2019s important to create a renovation list of \u201cmust-haves.\u201d These are elements that are definitely required for the project, then make a second wishlist of \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d This includes all of the changes you\u2019d like to see but might be willing to forgo as you consider your budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A home\u2019s existing condition<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s also crucial to be realistic about the condition of your home, as the cost of a gut renovation can vary considerably by the condition of the structure. Updating the mechanical systems such as the electrical panel and old plumbing can range from straightforward in a dated foursquare house to challenging in a home located in an historic district.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Ask your contractor about worst-case scenarios given the building\u2019s age and history. Consider the budget contingency that will give you peace of mind when your project kicks off. Your contractor can\u2019t price out every possible surprise, but you should feel confident that you have a partner who will help you problem-solve when challenges come up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have a contingency plan<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way including issues that come up once the walls are broken into. Add more than 15% for a gut remodel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Bathrooms contain the most plumbing and fixtures per square foot so tend to be the most expensive spaces in the house per square foot. Kitchens are next, then the other living spaces follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Should you leave or stay during a gut home renovation?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the most important considerations is <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deciding where you\u2019ll live during the project<\/a>. Nearly anything is possible, so you probably <i>can<\/i> remain in the house during the project. However, nearly any other plan is preferable for most people because you\u2019ll almost certainly have to deal with surprises. You might discover a need for structural reinforcement, or unveil mold or asbestos, and decide then that you should reside elsewhere for a while. Also, if you do choose to stay during the project, you\u2019ll need to make sure that you\u2019re legally allowed to do so, too. Your city\u2019s building department is the place to inquire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Just remember that if you decide to stay in the home during the project to save money, you\u2019ll still incur costs, and they could be substantial. Financial costs include delaying the project because you or your things are in the way. Non-financial costs could include a strain on daily family routines such as finding alternatives for when a kitchen or shower is being renovated. All those can result in financial costs, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your contractor will guide you through the cost for permits and regulations associated with your project, such as placing dumpsters. If your home is in a homeowner\u2019s association, they will also have requirements to meet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Demolition before renovation<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s4\">The demolition part of gutting a home is mostly labor and disposal costs, so it\u2019s not really that expensive but removing plumbing pipes and drains and so on takes time. O<\/span><span class=\"s5\">utsourcing the demo or doing it as a DIY project doesn\u2019t really save much money. For safety and hazard concerns, Sweeten recommends leaving demolition to the professionals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note that moving walls is not included in these costs. Moving load-bearing walls requires consulting with a structural engineer, and that could be $500\u2014$1,000. Whenever you change walls around you\u2019ll need to build temporary support walls, so there\u2019s another cost to add in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During demolition, you may discover hazards like asbestos, lead paint, and mold. If you do, a pro will evaluate how extensive the problem is. These hazards are not DIY-friendly. In some places, you\u2019re not legally permitted to deal with these dangerous materials, especially asbestos which can only be handled by a professional.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The general contractor brings subcontractor connections<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, managing an extensive construction project like gutting a home is challenging and benefits from having an experienced general contractor. A general contractor usually has steady and long-standing connections to many subcontractors, so communication often goes smoothly. They will orchestrate and schedule between architects, engineers, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled labor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Architects <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/how-to-work-with-an-architect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">specialize in bringing ideas to fruition<\/a>, and they must communicate with homeowners at a high level.

Getting the input of the architect as early in the process as possible will be invaluable in helping you mentally walk through the steps in advance. Sweeten design-build firms have in-house architectural services.
