The attached single-family house was built in 1908, and we\u2019ve been slowly working on updating it. Last year, with the pandemic grounding us at home, we got to work renovating our backyard.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/outdoor-space\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backyard<\/a> was a blank canvas. The previous owners had laid concrete slabs on the ground in the area closest to the house, but the space was otherwise covered in grass. We allowed it to grow wild our first summer here. The brush got so high that our dog, Sasha, would walk out and disappear. <span class=\"s1\">We wanted to turn our barren backyard into a place that we\u2014my husband, Henry, our son, Gavin, and myself\u2014could enjoy.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Solving the rain problem<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Henry and I knew we wanted a deck with built-in seating, and we loved the modern look of horizontal fencing. <\/span>We liked <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bluestone pavers<\/a> and wanted to incorporate it. But our first concern was to identify and solve some engineering problems. We\u2019d had a water issue in our fence-enclosed backyard since we bought the place\u2014flooding whenever it rained. We needed a contractor who could fix that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"small-backyard-deck-with-seating\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg\" alt=\"Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brown-horizontal-board-fencing\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50579 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-12.jpg\" alt=\"Brown horizontal board fencing in a backyard deck with built in seating after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1501\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Seeking the right expertise<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">The process of finding our <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractor was streamlined and direct.

This made for a lot of holes in the ground, but they knew what they were doing and they ultimately solved the water problem. To create the deck, they drilled down in a series of spots, so large deck beams could be sunk into the earth. They then created a structural platform connecting the beams, which became the deck foundation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s3\">Our Sweeten contractor and his team were wonderful from beginning to end. <\/span>We\u2019d decided on the raised deck to break up the flow of the backyard. We agreed there should be a clear delineation between the ground and the spot where you &#8220;step&#8221; up onto the deck, like an outdoor living room. Whenever they had an idea, they would either lay it out or draw it for us. <span class=\"s3\">The result was a truly collaborative design that perfectly reflected our aesthetic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Customizing a Brooklyn deck renovation<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s4\">Long boards were framed horizontally to create the high vertical walls. <\/span>The contractor came up with the idea of spacing between the boards, and we loved it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s4\">Atop the foundation they\u2019d made, the contractors built <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-materials-101\/building-your-outdoor-deck\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the large platform deck<\/a>. Benches and planters were built around the perimeter. <\/span>They customized everything. The contractor had Henry and me sit on a &#8220;mock&#8221; bench and rest our arms with drinks to determine what height to build the side tables. The bench seat slides out to reveal built-in storage for pillows and gardening tools.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\">We picked a wood stain in a color we love\u2014it gives the wood a mixture of brightness and warmth we were looking for. A small but impactful detail was that the design team chose nails in a similar color so it blended with the wood. I didn&#8217;t even realize that nails came in different colors.<span class=\"s4\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">We chose square, untextured slabs of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/nyc-landscaping-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bluestone pavers<\/a> to surface the area between the house and the step-up onto the deck. The backdrop is the beautiful old brick of the building behind us!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brown-wooden-deck-with-horizontal-fencing\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50573 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-06.jpg\" alt=\"Brown wooden deck with horizontal fencing and patio table and chairs after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brown-planters-with-plants\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50571 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-04.jpg\" alt=\"Brown planters with plants and in built seating below the deck after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-couches-in-the-deck\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50578 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-11.jpg\" alt=\"Two white couches in the deck with the old brick wall building in the background after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Loving our Sweeten construction crew<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">The project manager and crew were great.
