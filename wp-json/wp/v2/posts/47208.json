What are the proven strategies? What\u2019s the most effective way to set goals?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are three performance categories to consider: <strong>Opportunities<\/strong>, <strong>Conversion<\/strong>, and <strong>Responsiveness<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Opportunities<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most general contracting firms need to find new clients each year. Even repeat clients rarely bring a steady stream of projects. To win an acceptable number of new clients, you need exposure to the right number of prospective clients. You will also need exposure to the right <i>kinds<\/i> of prospective clients. You want clients who have projects suited to your services, who have an adequate budget, and who are serious and prepared.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Getting your firm in front of the right clients saves valuable time\u2014you\u2019ll spend more time doing paid work, and less time discussing projects and making site visits that go nowhere.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conversion<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Of the prospective clients who see your profile, how many ask for an introduction?\u00a0 Looking at your Introductions, how many clients request a site visit? Of the jobs you bid on, how many do you win?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Working backwards like this will show you what numbers you need, as well as where you might want to improve your performance. Tracking these numbers will also help your Sweeten account manager make valuable strategy suggestions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Responsiveness<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">How quickly do you respond to new matches? To messages from prospective clients?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow responses are one of the most common reasons prospective clients give for declining a general contractor. Quick, enthusiastic, professional communication inspires a homeowner\u2019s trust. Slow or unengaged responses suggest that you\u2019ll be hard to work with or that you\u2019re not interested in the job.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the easiest ways to get a jump on your competitors: respond more quickly than they do. At Sweeten, we\u2019re constantly improving our communication tools, to make responding as fast and easy as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/my\/performance\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47210\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Performance-Page-Blog-Button.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"48\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Performance-Page-Blog-Button.png 331w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Performance-Page-Blog-Button-300x44.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out your <\/span>Company Performance Page<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn more about your progress with Sweeten.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What other kinds of goals are you setting for 2021? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/meetings.hubspot.com\/katherine79\/strategy-call-with-your-account-manager\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Account Manager would love to know<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three main performance categories to consider for your contracting firm What\u2019s the best way to grow your business in the new year?
