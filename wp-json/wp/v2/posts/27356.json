The house, built\u00a0in the style of a trinity, a slim structure that became popular during a population boom in the early 18th century, caught Nel&#8217;s eye while she was looking to purchase her first home. Two years later, the house was severely damaged by a fire that ravaged the entire street, resulting in a total gut.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 1,200-square-foot home has three stories\u2014plus a basement and roof deck with amazing city views\u2014and had to be rebuilt from the studs up.

The house is a 100-year-old trinity located in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Center City Philadelphia. I&#8217;m not sure if you have seen many trinities, but they are a pretty common home type in Philadelphia where the house is three stories tall and each floor is typically a single room. I met Greg shortly thereafter and the two of us lived in the house up until we got engaged in April 2016. We decided to move out because we were thinking about starting a family and wanted to find a home with a second bedroom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was a bit attached to this house and since I work in real estate we decided to try our hand at renting it versus selling it. We found great tenants and everything was going well until the fire last October. The fire destroyed six houses\u2014so basically, the entire block! It was heart-wrenching to watch something I had so many happy memories in be destroyed by fire. But, very fortunately, we have been able to rebuild, which actually has been a funny process because we were able to make some of the upgrades and changes we previously wanted to do when we lived there.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27906 mb-10 size-chrono\" title=\"trinity house floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Sample-Trinity-House-Floorplan-723x896.jpg\" alt=\"trinity house floor plan\" width=\"723\" height=\"896\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><span class=\"img-label\"> (<em>Above<\/em>) Example of a trinity floor plan that&#8217;s similar in size and layout to Nel&#8217;s house<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:\u00a0<\/b>What made you choose the neighborhood back when you were looking to purchase a home?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Nel:\u00a0<\/b>The Bella Vista neighborhood is truly one of my favorites in Philadelphia. We have a 100-year-old Italian bakery at the end of our street and so there is always the wonderful smell of something delicious baking in the air. We are also just around the corner from a park with a bocce court, as well as from the 9th Street Italian Market. I love the neighborhood&#8217;s vibe and all of the small independent businesses and restaurants that are at our front door.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:\u00a0<\/b>What\u2019s your favorite part of the house?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Nel:\u00a0<\/b>I think one of my favorite parts, aside from the 360-degree views from the roof deck, is the exposed brick wall. It feels like a piece of history which is really neat.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten: <\/b>What it was like working with your general contractor?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Nel: <\/b>This is actually our second renovation in 12 months, but our first time using Sweeten. I can&#8217;t tell you how wonderful our Sweeten contractor has been. He took\u00a0a very stressful situation and guided us through it with ease, and we couldn&#8217;t have been happier with how everything has turned out. Greg and I have actually joked about moving back in!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten: <\/b>Now that the house is finished, what are your plans for it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Nel: <\/b>We are going to keep it as a rental for now and who knows&#8230;maybe someday we will live there again!<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><strong>Now let\u2019s check in with the Sweeten general contractor\u00a0responsible for this townhouse\u2019s transformation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:<\/b> What were the challenges you faced while renovating this trinity house?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten contractor:<\/b>\u00a0It was the amount of work that needed to take place in the small footprint of the house. We needed to add new code-compliant systems to a home that was designed to have a small footprint\u00a0over 100 years ago! Several homes on the same block that were also damaged in the fire were under construction at the same time, so parking was limited. Material deliveries on the small street were very tough, if not impossible. All of the materials for the roof deck and drywall needed to be loaded in by hand.\u00a0Also, work on the roof deck was held up due to permits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten: <\/b>What was the damage done by the fire?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten contractor: <\/b>The entire home was flooded by the water used to extinguish the rooftop fire. The house was dried out and all damaged organic materials were removed prior to us being hired by a restoration company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:<\/b> What major work did you and your team tackle during the renovation?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten contractor: <\/b>We installed\u00a0all new electric, some plumbing, a new high-efficiency HVAC, insulation, drywall, and new finishes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:<\/b> Did you encounter any delays during the process?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten contractor: <\/b>Yes, the roof deck had to be designed by a licensed architect\u2014we couldn&#8217;t replace what was there under the permit for the interior.\u00a0The drawings for the roof deck also needed to be completed and reviewed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten:<\/b> The results are simply stunning\u2014all of your hard work has definitely paid off!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sweeten contractor: <\/b>Overall, it was a great project, Nel was a wonderful client and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without Sweeten making the match.
