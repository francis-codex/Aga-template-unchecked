Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage.

After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. \u201cI saw 35 finished apartments that just were not \u2018me,\u2019 so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,\u201d she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list? A kitchen layout optimized for cooking, with plenty of natural light and a mix of traditional and modern details. She <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/29534\">posted her project on Sweeten<\/a> and after considering her matches chose a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4260\">Sweeten general contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37363 size-full\" title=\"anne-posing-in-her-kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"anne standing in her kitchen after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37357 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"two-kitchen-images-before-renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"two images of kitchen with maple cabinets and black countertop with undermount stainless steel sink and white appliances and square tiles on floor before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>After<\/strong><\/span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.<\/p>\n<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. \u201cI picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,\u201d she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.<\/p>\n<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne\u2019s contractor handled it all\u2014without delaying the estimated completion time. \u201cThe biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,\u201d she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37360 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"hardwood-floors-and-beige-kitchen-walls\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"white overhead kitchen cabinets and off-white under counter cabinets and stainless steel appliances and beige walls and hardwood floors and recessed lighting and ceiling fan with light after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A dire kitchen storage situation is resolved<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30962 size-full\" title=\"gray-custom-kitchen-cabinets-open-shelves\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05.jpg\" alt=\"gray custom kitchen cabinets with open shelves and white countertop with sink after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Project<\/strong><\/span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Before<\/span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap \u201880s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate\u2019s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. \u201cI spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,\u201d she said, \u201cso I really craved a little spot in which to sit.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/19777\">She posted her project on Sweeten<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3189\">chose her Sweeten contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg\" alt=\"beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>After<\/strong><\/span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.<\/p>\n<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets. \u00a0Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"light-brown-breakfast-bar\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-30986 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen09.jpg\" alt=\"light brown breakfast bar with bar stools in a kitchen with white countertop  and vinyl floor after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen09-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen09-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen09-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
