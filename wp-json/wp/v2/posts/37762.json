We weren&#8217;t prepared for the renovation to take as long as it did. We started demolition at the end of March and finished early August. Waiting for permits held stuff up a lot.

I kept imagining a huge island surrounded by those I love. I really wanted it to be different and for the cabinets underneath (and the lower perimeter cabinets) to be colorful. I&#8217;ve been going through a green phase. I came across swatches of Benjamin Moore Pine Green and was immediately inspired.
