When we purchased our early Craftsman Colonial home, we knew there would be lots of work to do. But it felt solid, had the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and great, livable space. Plus, the original unpainted chestnut moldings and leaded glass built-ins throughout the new house made any renovations that we needed to do seem bearable.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-DURING.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-carpeted-basement-blue-couch\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48543\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg\" alt=\"Beige carpeted basement with blue couch and furniture before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-75-AFTER.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"open-wiring-and-pipes-during-renovation\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48544\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-During-1.jpg\" alt=\"open wiring and pipes during renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-During-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-During-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-During-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"light-brown-vinyl-floor-basement\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48554 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg\" alt=\"Light brown vinyl floor in gray and white basement with stairs and banister after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-09-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>Before we were able to move in, we needed to completely rewire the entire house because it still had knob-and-tube wiring. This meant demolishing the &#8217;70s-style finished basement. We weren\u2019t that upset about losing the brown paneling, damp rug, and linoleum-tiled laundry room, and we were saving a lot of money by allowing the electrician free access to the walls and ceiling of the basement. The space had to be refurbished before it could be used for anything besides storage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a couple of months of rewiring, patching, and painting, we temporarily relocated the toy storage and our TV to the enclosed front porch and began working with an architect to rethink the space. We came to Sweeten to find a contractor to execute our architect\u2019s vision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our plans included moving the laundry room to free up the main living area for toys, creating a craft area, and carving out a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wine room<\/a>. An old phone booth left behind by the previous owners was relocated. We hoped to move as many pipes in the labyrinth hanging from the ceiling to provide more headroom for my 6\u2019 4\u201d husband and our two future six-footers\u2014our sons, currently ages six and eight. New windows were installed and additional waterproofing was added throughout the space.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Christiana_Basement-66-e1508331601201.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"gray-white-basement-recessed-shelves\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48553\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg\" alt=\"Gray and white basement area with recessed shelves and view of handrail and banister after renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"oak-vinyl-plank-flooring-basement\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48558\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg\" alt=\"Oak vinyl plank flooring in white entertainment room after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-13-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we got started working with our Sweeten contractor, we tried to determine where waterproofing was necessary and figured out what pipes could be moved and what had to stay. We ran PEX pipes for water in the walls and were able to run all electricity through the ceiling. We had to leave our steam pipes for our original but completely functional heating system because it was cost-prohibitive to move them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our contractor also created easy access points for a (hopefully not so distant) kitchen renovation. In the end, the ceiling in the basement was raised from under six-and-a-half feet to over eight feet tall\u2014a huge improvement and a crucial part of the renovation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the not-so-glamorous phases of waterproofing, plumbing, and electric were completed, we began to see the new rooms take shape. We were surprised by the space that needed to be left between the block walls and the drywall for fireproofing but decided to incorporate built-ins for board games as well as arts-and-crafts supplies. Our contractor also built a custom shelving unit under our TV to help prevent kids from walking into the corner of the TV when it was pulled out from the wall. The area under the stairs turned into a fort for the boys.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the walls, we chose a warm gray paired with a soft white trim. The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/wood-flooring-cost-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floors<\/a> are COREtec, which looks like walnut but is actually an engineered plank that\u2019s perfect for below-grade spaces. This was one of our contractor\u2019s best recommendations\u2014a floating floor that is easily replaced if it gets wet, feels great underfoot, and looks amazing. We love it, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-13-AFTER.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-gray-laundry-area-custom-cabinetry\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48549\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-04.jpg\" alt=\"White and gray laundry area with custom cabinetry and washer dryer after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christiana_Basement-17.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-gray-laundry-space-quartz countertop\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48548\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-03.jpg\" alt=\"White and gray laundry space with sink and white quartz countertop and retractable laundry airer after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"child-playing-drums-in-basement\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48559 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-14.jpg\" alt=\"Child playing drums in the renovated basement\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-14-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>We installed IKEA kitchen cabinets and laminate countertops in our laundry room, which were big cost-savers and resulted in a sleek and lovely place to do <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/washer-dryer-apartment-additions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">laundry<\/a>. A wall-mounted drying rack is one of my favorite features. My kids and husband have turned the storage room into a music room, but as long as they don\u2019t mind playing next to our second freezer and extra Cheerios, it works for me!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s about it for the first phase of our basement renovation. Of course, there are still items on the to-do list. We are planning to turn the wooden phone booth at the bottom of the stairs into a fun space for the boys<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span>it has working electricity, so we are hoping to wire it with wifi or as a charging station. We will also either paint it red (Londonesque) or blue (Doctor Who!), and add a plaque on the top with our last name. Next to the phone booth is a door that leads to our unfinished wine room, another project for the future.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"couple-with-two-kids-in-entertainment-room\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48556 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg\" alt=\"Couple with two kids in the entertainment room after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Cristiana-Basement-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For now, though, we love spending time in our new basement\u2014and getting dedicated storage for the toys, drums, and storage off the main floor! It\u2019s become a great family room for us to hang out in, and for the boys to play with their friends. Working with our Sweeten contractor was an amazing experience.
