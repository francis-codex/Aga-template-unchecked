The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles<\/span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Top photo<\/em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Los Angeles home renovation<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t really see much of a change,\u201d said Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5968#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LA general contractor Trevor<\/a>. \u201cIt&#8217;s just a redirect.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs<\/span><span class=\"s2\">.<\/span>\u00a0\u201cThe cost of lumber is affecting building,\u201d said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. \u201cPeople are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">A renewed focus on outdoor living<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cA lot more people are fixing their exterior,\u201d said Trevor. \u201cPeople want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that\u2019s where you spend 60 percent of your time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cozystylishchic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung<\/a> agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about indoor-outdoor living,\u201d she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. \u201cThey double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,\u201d said Jeanne.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor\/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Homeowners are also investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/outdoor-space\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outdoor rooms<\/a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, \u201cdefinitely going back to nature.\u201d Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. \u201cA salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there\u2019s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">ADUs and additions for more square footage<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). \u201cIt\u2019s generating the <span style=\"color: #333333;\">biggest buzz,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractor Trevor. <\/span>These detached structures, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/garage\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">often garages<\/a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. \u201cThey\u2019re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Kirsty-House-06.jpg\" alt=\"Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><span style=\"color: #76808f;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten renovators <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirsty and David&#8217;s<\/a> Mid-City\/Miracle Mile home in LA<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cYou can build a second story,\u201d said Sweeten contractor Trevor. \u201cIt\u2019s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It\u2019s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.\u201d If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ca\/los-angeles-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractor in LA<\/a> with experience will guide you through the process.<\/p>\n<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\">\u201cIt\u2019s where you get the most <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bang for the buck<\/a>,\u201d said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">returned to kitchens<\/a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. \u201cIt\u2019s like changing wardrobes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there\u2019s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there\u2019s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks\u2014tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg\" alt=\"peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) A verde stone blend backsplash in a LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cHere in LA, my clients don\u2019t want polished,\u201d said Jeanne. \u201cI am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.\u201d Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it\u2019s pretty porous.<\/p>\n<h4>Finishes lead the way<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors\u2014black, deep blues, and bottle greens\u2014are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. \u201cI do a lot of antiqued blue\u2014like a muted denim\u2014with brass pulls,\u201d he said.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend\u2014with an average of 7&#8243;\u2014and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">The spa bath is redefined<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">In Los Angeles, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">upgrading the whole bathroom<\/a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force<\/i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won\u2019t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg\" alt=\"large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The divide\u2014choosing between tub and shower\u2014is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">return on investment<\/a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">More than ever, the bath is <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">considered an oasis<\/a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Storage is key<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg\" alt=\"Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span style=\"color: #76808f;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten renovators <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s<\/a> Westchester home in LA<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Mudrooms are still going strong<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. \u201cEspecially with the pandemic,\u201d she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It\u2019s like a decontamination area\u2014coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.\u201d Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">There\u2019s an uptick in requests for libraries<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cIt\u2019s a very popular room right now,\u201d said Sweeten contractor Trevor. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get more popular. I\u2019ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries\u2014real traditional, with everything built in.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Home offices are making a comeback<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband\u2019s office more fashionable\u2014because of his frequent video calls.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-guide-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seismic codes<\/a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" class=\"elementor-button-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Find a contractor<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Classic and traditional design emerges<\/h3>\n<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\">\u201cMid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,\u201d he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back\u2014I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I\u2019ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.\u201d<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">Statement decorating is hot. It\u2019s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash.\u00a0Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">There\u2019s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">\u201cSimplicity\u2014we\u2019re definitely going in that direction,\u201d said Sweeten contractor Trevor. \u201cNot so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.\u201d There\u2019s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.<\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\">California style\u2014with a modern or rustic refined look\u2014still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span>An interior designer and a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">licensed general contractor<\/a>, who is familiar with local codes, can translate your vision into a tangible design. <\/span>When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to renovate with the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best contractors in LA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated on April 19, 2023<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
