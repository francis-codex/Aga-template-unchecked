Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens.

These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it\u2019s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined.

True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home\u2019s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space.

Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that\u2019s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>PROS<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>CONS<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Short counter<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">No matter the size of your home, there\u2019s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space.

When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ideas-and-inspiration\/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">galley layout<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-wall layout<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ideas-and-inspiration\/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peninsula layout<\/a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From L-shaped or galley to an island kitchen, use these ideas to choose which kitchen layout is best for your home\u00a0 Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel.
