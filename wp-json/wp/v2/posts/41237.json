Some sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For L.A. homeowners interested in renovating, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. Additionally, you\u2019ll want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up, and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Remodeling costs per square foot in Los Angeles<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret that Los Angeles is one of the pricier real estate markets in the United States. However, the housing stock in the area is fairly new. As a result, L.A. homes won\u2019t experience behind-the-wall issues that are often found in older structures. Kitchens and baths are the most popular renovation types. Exterior upgrades and garage conversions are also on the rise to create additional living space.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When starting the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-guide-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">process in a whole house<\/a>, on average, many of our projects can range from <\/span><b>$100<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to <\/span><b>$400+<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf. Typically, dry rooms (i.e., living rooms and bedrooms) are cheaper to renovate than wet rooms (i.e., kitchen and baths), and is<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimated that while <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updating living rooms or bedrooms<\/a>\u2014dry rooms\u2014are at the lower end of the range, the wet rooms are closer to <\/span><b>$400<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf to start.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Interior designer costs in Los Angeles<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also checked in with L.A.-based<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.haleyweidenbaum.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> interior designer Haley Weidenbaum<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how interior designers calculate fees. She explains, \u201cTypically for renovation projects, I will charge a flat fee. This is beneficial for both designer and client. It allows the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designer to work<\/a> more freely and offers more transparency between the designer and the client. However, it is important for both parties to agree on a scope of work. Everyone should be on the same page and understand what is included under this flat fee.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>How much a Los Angeles kitchen remodel costs per square foot<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">preparing for a kitchen remodel<\/a>, remember that California banned the running of new gas lines to any new construction\u2014which means no gas stoves. This move is essential in the lowering of the carbon footprint. Even though buildings with existing gas lines aren\u2019t affected, be sure to check the latest codes. If you\u2019re looking to renovate for resale, you don\u2019t want to invest in appliances that aren\u2019t in compliance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The logistics of storage and delivery make the cost of cabinets in L.A. less expensive than more densely populated urban areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen remodeling costs<\/a>: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <\/span><b>$24,500<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for 200 square feet.

Value Report. This pricing includes carpeting in the bedroom and tile on the bathroom floor, lighting throughout, and an exhaust fan.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A crawl space and a raised foundation make it easier for the crew to crawl underneath the subfloor to access the rough connections. It becomes more challenging and expensive when working on a renovation with a house on a slab on grade. If fixtures are being relocated or saw cuts, trenching, and backfill are required, then these can add to the cost of the renovation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upscale master suite addition: For approximately <\/span><b>$606<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf, or <\/span><b>$388,427<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s possible to create a 32\u2019 x 20\u2019 master suite with a separate sitting area and a large master bath, also over crawl space, according to the Cost v.

There are numerous other factors that come into play. Importantly, what you have to work with is key\u2014are you converting an existing structure that has electrical and\/or plumbing? If so, it could be a relatively affordable proposition. Sweeten contractors Anna &amp; Vahik tell us that in Los Angeles County, conversions average about <strong>$75,000<\/strong>\u00a0while ground-up constructions start at a range between <strong>$125,000<\/strong> to <strong>$150,000<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Converting garages<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifics of an ADU conversion will cause a wide variance in the costs associated with bringing it to compliance. Some Sweeten contractors have been able to convert garages to ADUs with a <strong>$58,000 <\/strong>budget, which already had plumbing (sewer) and its own electrical service. Another old garage was completely converted costing about <strong>$196,000<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Costs for remodeling permits in Los Angeles<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Los Angeles.
