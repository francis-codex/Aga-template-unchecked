Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels \u201cmore like a room,\u201d said Mary Ann, \u201cand plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.\u201d They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage<\/a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,\u201d said Mary Ann. \u201cNow, everything is put away.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bonus<\/strong><\/span>: Mary Ann\u2019s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large \u201cyou can do yoga in it.\u201d The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun to take a shower now,\u201d said Mary Ann. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Style finds<\/strong><\/span>:\u00a0<\/span>Traditional Exposed Dual Control Thermostatic shower system:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/usa.hudsonreed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hudson Reed<\/a>.\u00a0Devonshire standard bathroom faucet; K-3551-0 White Archer Toilet; Verdure Collection Medicine Cabinet:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.us.kohler.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kohler<\/a>.\u00a0Trinsic Collection (accessories):\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.deltafaucet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delta<\/a>.
