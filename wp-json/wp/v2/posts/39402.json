In the past year, we had increased our product selection dramatically and needed ways to present these products. We also needed a more efficient plan for storing product so staff could easily merchandise and restock the shelves. This meant moving inventory up to the sales floor. We created a storage room in the back that took up more square footage, but because of the new fixture plan and flow, the store actually feels more spacious and allows for easier navigation from section to section.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How does your new retail design represent your brand?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sharon:<\/strong> We were able to create better ways to showcase our large product selection and still keep the store feeling welcoming, safe, and fun. We used sleek tables and cabinets that allow our products to shine and encourage customers to explore. Customers can see more products through printed posters, mannequins, or display units; the shopping experience is much more interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Our entryway has selfie stations where customers can have a little fun. They break the ice for those who may never have been to a sex toy shop or are apprehensive to enter. They allow customers to relax and realize that this can be a fun place to shop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sharon:<\/strong> Executing a remodel from across the country always poses potential problems. This remodel was scheduled to happen at our busiest time of year, so I was unable to get to New York to meet with contractors. Once our contractor was selected through Sweeten, I presented scaled drawings of the changes needed for this project, and through phone calls and emails, we were able to get the project underway. It was very helpful having an outstanding area manager, Amy Carnegie, on site to act as a liaison when necessary. Once I arrived in New York, the final stages of the renovation were completed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39372 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-10.jpg\" alt=\"Babeland store interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-10-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-10-600x402.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39374 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-12.jpg\" alt=\"Babeland store interior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1498\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sharon:<\/strong> It had been years since I last worked with a contractor in New York, so I needed a reliable resource to help find a contractor that could execute the work required within our budget. I presented the job requirements through Sweeten\u2019s website and immediately received responses. They matched us with quite a few potential contractors. Once we accepted a bid from our chosen contractor, Sweeten stayed in touch with me on several occasions to check on progress, and offer assistance if needed. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">I felt completely confident with the process, even with being close to 3,000 miles away from the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial companies like yourself?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sharon<\/strong>: The services Sweeten offer are fantastic.
