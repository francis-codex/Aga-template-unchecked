After living there for four years, the couple really wanted to create a defined space for their 2-year-old son, Zacharia, and\u00a0a baby girl soon to arrive in May, that the siblings could claim as their own. As part of the remodel, they wanted to carve out a peaceful space for themselves to relax as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The building, an eight-story concrete structure that was once a toy factory, was converted to 56 condos around 2005. The couple loved the industrial look of the apartment, especially the big concrete column, and high ceilings with exposed HVAC metal vent. However, the divider wall that split the loft layout into what Sophie said was \u201ckinda two bedrooms,\u201d didn\u2019t go up to the ceiling and had no doors, so there was no sound isolation or privacy. Also, she said, \u201cthe second bedroom was really tiny and didn&#8217;t have much light coming through.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With clear goals in mind, they\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/26018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted their project<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4604\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">matched with their contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33301 size-chrono\" title=\"floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33303 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33304 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"red-winged-chair-living-room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"red winged chair in living room with panelled window and brown floor after renovation \" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The new wall would help them\u00a0shape the modern and industrial look that\u00a0complemented the building. Since this project was about defining living spaces, it\u00a0focused on function over style, although, Sophie said, \u201cthe resulting look of the space was important to us, and we tried making conscious design choices\u00a0to match our style.\u201d They chose hardware with linear shapes while traditional base moldings\u00a0were replaced with straight profiles, along with trim around the door frames.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and a children&#8217;s bedroom in NYC, the bedroom wins.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To increase the size of the kids\u2019 bedroom and\u00a0keep enough space for their own bedroom, Sophie and Michael\u00a0tested various configurations for every feature they wanted using 3-D renderings from the software program Sketch Up. Their decision-making process was guided by such questions as: \u201cHow far should they extend the bedrooms?\u201d, \u201cWould the kids\u2019 room allow them to grow with a bunk bed?\u201d, \u201cHow much natural light would reach\u00a0the space?\u201d, and \u201cHow high\/big should the transom window be?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33305 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"gray-walled-living-room-blue-bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif\" alt=\"gray walled living room with view of blue bedroom and nursery after renovation \" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWe had a fair amount of square footage in the hall entrance, which was not well-used,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cIf asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and\u00a0a children&#8217;s\u00a0bedroom in New York City, the bedroom wins. The presence of a sprinkler\u00a0limited us, but we were able to take two feet [width-wise].\u201d And now, two strollers can still fit in the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d Sophie said.\u00a0Extending one extra foot lengthwise helped to accommodate more furniture for the kids while leaving sufficient space in the dining area. \u201cFor\u00a0the master, we decided not to extend it by that same one foot because it would have brought the wall to the middle of the windows, reducing our living room too much and affecting the amount of natural light coming through,\u201d\u00a0she explained.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33307 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33306 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While they had some initial concerns that the bump-out would break the flow of the apartment, \u201cit actually helped create a better flow and even defined a separation between our living room area and our dining room area since there\u2019s a virtual line where the wall comes forward. And the kids\u2019 bedroom is now a usable and decent-sized room.\u201d Their Sweeten contractor also\u00a0found a solution to connect the HVAC vent to the rooms and keep them flush with the walls rather than extending\u00a0outward into the room.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To preserve as much natural light as possible the living space and bedrooms, they designed a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/transom-windows-let-the-light-in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transom<\/a> between the two bedrooms and opted for pocket doors. \u201cWe wanted the kids to have a French door,\u201d Sophie said, but they would have swung too widely into the apartment and taken up too much space. The soft-close <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pocket doors<\/a> were painted a darker stain to contrast against lighter walls. It was also a departure from the red tone found in their wood floors\u2014which they weren\u2019t fans of. \u201cThat will be yet another project,\u201d she noted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every renovation comes with a little stress. In this case, since the whole family had no sleeping quarters for a while, they moved to an Airbnb for about two weeks. \u201cThat didn\u2019t leave much flexibility in the timeline for unexpected surprises,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cFortunately, our contractor stuck to the deadline with just a little bit of delay, but it was still manageable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33309 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33308 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"open-plan layout renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They felt it was great to have Sweeten&#8217;s assistance from the start, giving them more confidence than just randomly searching the Internet on their own. \u201cThe process to schedule appointments with the contractors was fast and efficient,\u201d\u00a0Sophie said. \u201cKnowing that we could contact one specific person at Sweeten&#8217;s client services if an issue arose compared to just having a generic email address is reassuring.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before a renovation, \u201cyou think you&#8217;ve covered your bases, but there are so many details, it\u2019s sometimes hard not to get overwhelmed,\u201d Sophie said. Choosing paint colors was one of the things that became maddening. It\u2019s one thing to see it on paper or in 3-D on the computer, but \u201cyou&#8217;re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,\u201d\u00a0she\u00a0said. Admittedly obsessed with finding the right shade, she explained, \u201cWe ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I&#8217;d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The couple is \u201cextremely happy with how the kids\u2019 bedroom turned out,\u201d Sophie said. Now that the renovation is finished, and the nursery has doors to close, Zacharia has a quiet place to rest during nap time and at night. And, said Sophie, \u201chaving defined spaces makes it a lot easier to keep our apartment feel put together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>MASTER BEDROOM RESOURCES: Wall paint in Newburg Green; paint on all other walls in Super White:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benjamin Moore<\/a>.\u00a0Horgen 1-Light pendant ceiling light:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.maximlightinglights.com\/collection\/maxim-lighting-horgen-collection.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maxim<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>KIDS&#8217; ROOM RESOURCES: Rullan shade and Gothem cord set for ceiling light fixture: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ikea<\/a>.\u00a0French doors and hardware:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonhardware.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johnson Hardware<\/a>.
