For a long time, the place felt \u201csoooo big.\u201d That is, until the couple started their family. Now, with an 11-year-old son, a 9-year-old daughter, cat, Romeo, and her husband\u2019s ever-growing record collection, Andr\u00e9a said, \u201cIt started feeling claustrophobic.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44521\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Portrait-11.jpg\" alt=\"Sweeten renovator, Sweeten home renovator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Portrait-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Portrait-11-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first space in their Harlem home she wanted to tackle: the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s where I spend a lot of time,\u201d says Andr\u00e9a. \u201cIt was so cluttered and dim. I didn\u2019t enjoy cooking at all. I remember balancing pans on top of each other while making dinner.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Storage was clearly an issue. \u201cFirst of all, the shelves in our cabinets weren\u2019t adjustable\u2014so we couldn\u2019t even store cereal boxes or olive oil or anything taller than about eight inches. So we just had a ton of stuff on the counters or on top of the fridge.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"oak-kitchen-cabinets-before-renovation\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-44508 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-Before.jpg\" alt=\"dark kitchen with oak cabinets and hardwood floors and gas cooking range with hood before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-Before.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-Before-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Appliances ate into counter space as well. \u201cWe had this massive microwave that took up an entire baking station, so we lost workspace there, too.\u201d And then there was the lighting. \u201cWe had this one dim light that didn\u2019t even light up the area by the sink. We always felt like we were working in the dark. And our dishwasher was dying.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The two had an unpleasant experience with a master bath reno 12 years ago (Andr\u00e9a says the contractor took their money and disappeared). This time, they posted <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/20058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their Harlem kitchen renovation project<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free renovation platform that connects homeowners with vetted contractors, and they were immediately impressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI felt like the Sweeten contractor we chose offered the best price for the job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His team is very efficient and punctual. It\u2019s great to have someone show up when they say they will and finish on time!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>After<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the same 450-square-footprint was retained, their Harlem kitchen was expanded a few feet by knocking down a wall and opening up space for a bar\/counter and pantry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"contemporary-chandelier-and-hardwood-floorss\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-44512 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-3.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors and cabinets with glass doors on either side of window and contemporary chandelier after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Besides improving storage and lighting, Andr\u00e9a knew the look and style she wanted from their kitchen renovation. \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I miss it all the time\u2014the weather, the sky, the ocean. So I picked colors that reminded me of my hometown of Morro Bay and also the Bay area, where I went to college,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I liked the idea of gray cabinets. My mom recently did her kitchen in all white, and after two years, it was already showing use. It seemed impractical with two kids.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The gray stock cabinets reminded her of fog around the ocean (\u201ca win-win\u201d). And the paint, kind of a peach color, was like sunsets\u2014\u201ca soothing combination.\u201d\u00a0 Even the grout color between white subway tiles has a little peach in it. She felt a quartz countertop was a nice balance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-cabinets-with-stainless-steel-appliances\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-44514 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-5.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and gas cooking range with hood and hardwood floors after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Andrea-Kitchen-5-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Andr\u00e9a loves tea, and she has some beautiful blue Fortnum and Mason (a brand based in London) tins, which also reinforced the blue accents. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of Jamaica-meets-Miami-meets-Cali-meets-London,\u201d she says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Andr\u00e9a says that their contractor\u2019s wife, Suzy, also helped make sure everything went smoothly.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSuzy was a godsend,\u201d says Andrea. \u201cWe had a pretty firm budget and I felt like she worked very hard to stay in it without pushing for more expensive stuff or using cheap things. It was a very nice middle ground.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And the result? A huge success. \u201cI love the whole feel of (the new space),\u201d says Andr\u00e9a. \u201cThe colors are really inviting, and the cabinets make it feel bigger, even though it\u2019s basically the same square footage. Of course, the kitchen is so beautiful, now we want to update everything in the house!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Bonus<\/strong><\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">:<\/span> \u201cI love my undercabinet lighting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t originally in the plans.
