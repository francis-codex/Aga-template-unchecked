See what made these Sweeten partnerships special<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/HomeownersReview.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support\u2014for free.<\/p>\n<h3>Detailed scopes of work<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;I was very fortunate to have <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/aleks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aleks and his team<\/a> work on my apartment&#8217;s renovation. From the start when I met him for the first time, Aleks was friendly, very meticulous, and attentive to details. He proposed options and recommendations for my requirements without being aggressive. Aleks provided me with a very detailed scope of work. Because of this, it only took the property management company of my co-op building 2 weeks to approve the work. They did a full renovation of bathroom and kitchen, refinishing the floors, painting, replacing the closet shelvings and bars, and refinishing the closet doors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Handling difficult building management<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We worked with <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4044#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eli and his team<\/a> on a kitchen renovation in our co-op. For anyone that has worked or owned a co-op before, you know there can be a lot of back and forth with approvals with the co-op board and management company. Eli was a great partner in getting all of the necessary documentation to the management company, and communicating directly with them when needed.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Working with the budget<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;We had a wonderful time working with <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4137#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">James<\/a>. As first-time homeowners, we had heard horror stories from friends about unresponsive contractors they had encountered while renovating. Certainly not our experience at all with James. They worked around our budget and helped us understand which items were worth splurging on and where we could cut back.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Kris was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16043212],&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1169#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kris<\/a> was very respectful of our budget and was great about letting us know if any changes we made were going to increase the estimate and by how much. We had heard so many horror stories from our friends that made us nervous at first\u2014but Kris and his team though were very professional and completed the work on time and on budget. We&#8217;re thrilled with the work they did!&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Leading first-time renovators to success<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/santiago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;Santiago<\/a> was very pleasant and easy to work with. As first-time renovators, we appreciated his patience in answering our 1,000,000 questions. He was very flexible in helping us define a scope for the project that matched our budget and helped us strategize to make our money go the furthest. During the work phase, his team was mindful of the fact that we still lived in the space (with a toddler!) and did their best to minimize disruption to our lives. They also finished on time and on budget!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Consistent, clear communication<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Working with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pellumb (Paul)<\/a> was hands-down the best renovation decision I made. He has incredible communication skills and kept me informed from start to finish. As an interior designer in the industry for over 12 years, I was pleasantly surprised to meet a contractor with such pride and commitment to his work. His crew was timely and respectful when working in my home. I was lucky enough to go on vacation for 2 weeks towards the end of the project, and when 2 surprise leaks were discovered, the problem was resolved without hesitation. Paul was only a WhatApp message away with pictures and updates of the problem being solved.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Friendly subcontractor teams<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;During the construction, we got to know all the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3568#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general contractor&#8217;s workers<\/a> and really enjoyed having them around. (And even know all their personalities and preferred playlists!) They are respectful and diligent. Most importantly, they&#8217;re very experienced and are able to give good suggestions and to make decisions. We lived on-site for the second half of the project. It was definitely messy and frustrating at times, but the crew made it easier for us. We truly appreciated that.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Helping hands for materials &amp; design<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFrom the beginning, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/paulina-albert\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paulina<\/a> &#8216;got&#8217; what we were looking for: a modern, minimalist aesthetic that is functional for a family. Her creative design of the space, kitchen, closets, and built-ins helped to maximize our space and make our apartment feel much more spacious than the actual square footage would suggest. Our 9-year-old daughter gave her a nearly impossible task to find &#8216;teal and rainbow&#8217; tiles for her bathroom and she found a beautiful iridescent tile that has drawn the admiration of all who have seen it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Keeping a clean worksite<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;During the work, I was able to stay in my apartment because <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/meet-sweeten-general-contractors-nina-ilya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ilya and Nina<\/a> took great precautions to cover everything with plastic so that it wouldn\u2019t be covered with dust. At the end of each workday, the team also cleaned up the workspace, to the extent possible, and stored everything in one, compact space.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/meet-sweeten-general-contractor-paul-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paul<\/a> and team have been amazing the whole way, and while we did more than half of the work before we moved in, we moved in while the top floor was still being renovated and lived in the space for about 8 weeks during construction. The team was great in keeping the site clean, but we really noticed that they kept the dust and construction contained once we had moved in too!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Problem-solving pros<\/h3>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Chris is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver. He was always quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls regardless of time of day. My project was a gut renovation in an apartment that hadn't been occupied for over 6 years. Despite some challenges, including a bathroom so small that a standard sized tub couldn't fit in, a leak discovered by Chris's plumber, and a switch from a gas stove to electric, Chris was able to deliver the project on time and close to the initial proposal. The few change orders were my chosen enhancements to the project - including a custom closet and moving the bathroom pipes closer to the edges of the wall to gain a few inches for the bathroom. Highly recommend Chris. Gut renovations in a New York City apartment co-op are incredibly stressful and Chris was a reliable contractor I trusted to get the job done and appease the board.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:771,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16773836},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}\">&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5698#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris<\/a> is an incredibly responsive general contractor and a great problem solver.

Our project was massive! New roof, gutters, windows, and siding, to our 95-year-old free-standing house. Plus, we completely gutted and redesigned the basement with upgrades in plumbing and electrical, as well as finding and fixing a leak issue that caused the basement to flood during heavy rains. Doing such a variety of work required tremendous organization, workweeks planned weeks in advance and staying flexible when the unexpected arose. Neil handled each step with patience and humor, and so when each project was finished, we felt happy, confident, and satisfied that the craftsmanship was what we desired and all problems were resolved.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h4>Ready to get Sweeten general contractor matches for your project?<\/h4>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46413\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post a Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>We do our homework!
