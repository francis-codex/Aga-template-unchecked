It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes\u2014a few we had renovated\u2014so we weren\u2019t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we started the buying phase<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44562\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg\" alt=\"NYC renovation portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early \u201890s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer\/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn\u2019t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif\" alt=\"closet turn home office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It\u2019s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A\/C bills. And it\u2019s a plus in a prewar building where you can\u2019t regulate the heat in winter.\u00a0 We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room\u2014we love books and are avid readers.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg\" alt=\"stainless steel kitchen counter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle<\/h3>\n<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a \u201csay\u201d in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten as the backstop<\/a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.\u00a0 Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selecting and getting product delivered in time<\/a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It\u2019s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, Beth and Bob, for sharing your empty nest renovation with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovation Materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN: Countertops, subway tile backsplash: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caesarstoneus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Caesarstone<\/span><\/a>.
