Having a clear scope and budget when you\u2019re ready to find the right contractor is a good position to be in. Here, we offer a guide on how to plan a home renovation and set yourself up for success from start to finish.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose your renovation \u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Homeowners renovate for many reasons\u2014you just bought a new space that needs a refresh (or a gut!), your family is growing or you\u2019d like to downsize, a repair is needed and a long-awaited renovation makes sense now, or maybe what you have just isn\u2019t working for you. Whatever the reason driving the decision, the first step for any major renovation is crucial: identify the \u201cmust-have\u201d elements for your home. Have an idea of what\u2019s definitively required and you will be better equipped to have an informed conversation when the time comes to meet with general contractors and architects.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Equally important is making a wishlist of \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d This includes all of the changes you\u2019d like to see, but would be willing to forgo due to budget limitations. In tandem with determining the \u201cmust-haves\u201d and the \u201cnice-to-haves,\u201d decide the exact space(s) you are renovating, and what kind of updates (cosmetic, gut, layout changes, etc.), you plan to make. While a cosmetic update would not involve any layout changes or moving of plumbing and\/or electrical, a gut renovation means demolishing the existing space down to the studs, and rebuilding the entire interior floor-to-ceiling.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Determine who to hire for your renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you have your list of \u201cmust-haves,\u201d you\u2019ll have a better sense of what type of expert you\u2019ll need for your renovation. Depending on what you\u2019re planning to do, you\u2019ll want to meet with different types of experts.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">When to work with <strong>general contractors<\/strong>:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>removing or replacing finishes but generally keeping things in the same place<\/li>\n<li>comfortable selecting fixtures and finishes yourself<\/li>\n<li>ready to start construction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>When to work with an <strong>architect and a general contractor, or a design-build firm:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>making major layout or structural changes<\/li>\n<li>moving plumbing or gas lines<\/li>\n<li>renovating a landmark property<\/li>\n<li>looking for professional design help<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While many general contractors can provide general guidance when it comes to selecting fixtures and finishes, you may also want to hire an interior designer if you want more extensive help creating your ideal space. Most <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractors can refer you to an architect they&#8217;ve done work with if their services are required. If it looks like you\u2019ll need an architect for your renovation, you may be able to hire a design-build firm to help as a one-stop shop. As the name suggests, this type of firm takes care of the design as well as the construction phase of a project. Some lean more design-forward while others are construction-forward. Interview a few to see what you feel comfortable with.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tip:<\/strong> When you post your renovation to find a general contractor, we\u2019ll match you with GCs and design-build firms best suited to your project.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Research the cost of your renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is always the tough part\u2014figuring out how much money you\u2019ll need for the renovation. How much should you spend? How much do you have to spend? As a starting point, we have seen the average cost to renovate <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an entire home<\/a> typically between $80 to $200 per square foot. The price can vary from room to room, as <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen upgrades<\/a> and bathrooms tend to be more expensive and bedrooms and living rooms cost less. Costs also vary based on geographical location.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47677 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg\" alt=\"how long does a kitchen remodel take\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Kitchen-Split-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Kitchen-Split-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here to read how long it takes to remodel a kitchen<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s break it down: you\u2019ll need to consider the cost of labor, materials, and finishes, plus associated fees like city permits, board approvals, and\/or design fees. If you plan to hire a designer and\/or an architect, account for the fact that both charge a percentage (ranging from 5 to 20 percent of project costs) for their fee.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Costs for remodeling materials and finishes<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understandably, many people focus on the visible aspects of the renovation\u2014the materials and finishes\u2014which, depending on whether you choose budget, mid-, or high-end products, will account typically for 50 percent or less of the full cost of the renovation. The good news is that this is the first step to understanding what kind of renovation you\u2019ll be able to afford; take a look at various retailers and websites to see how much that Moroccan tile costs per square foot. An efficient way to do this is to list the materials you\u2019d like to include, and price out all the materials in a spreadsheet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> See our <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/remodeling-cost-guides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovation cost guides<\/a> for city-level cost estimates.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Costs for remodeling labor<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next, you\u2019ll want to account for the cost of labor. As each firm is different, the best way to do this is to meet with general contractors to get a sense of how much their labor costs will run. There are many variables; in the busy summer season, for example, labor tends to be more expensive than during the winter months. They will also assess your specific job site. If you live in a co-op building with difficult street parking, plus strict rules governing the renovation itself in terms of allowable work hours and protection of the common areas, labor will be costlier than in a standalone house where the contractor has more freedom to park in the driveway and work around the clock.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take into consideration wet areas like <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bathroom redesigns<\/a> or kitchens cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex. The type of finishes you choose will also affect costs. Mosaic tilework and woodworking will require labor with specialized skills compared to basic installations such as subway tile.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you live in a condo or co-op, knowing the specific rules governing your building <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">before setting up for a site visit<\/a> allows your contractor to provide a more accurate bid.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37982 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>\u00a0(<em>Above<\/em>)\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whole-home renovation<\/a> with an open kitchen, skim-coated walls, and new closets<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Extra fees for remodeling<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The associated fees that come with renovating are often overlooked. Most city or town permits come with a price tag, and if you live in a co-op or condo, review your building\u2019s alteration agreement\/documentation to determine if there are extra costs, such as an engineer mandated by the building to approve your plans.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Budget for contingencies<\/span><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, leave a 10% cushion for unexpected costs. Even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry or need tweaking, and that safety net will ensure that you\u2019re not venturing into uncomfortable territory if your renovation costs exceed your budget.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Find the best general contractor or architect for your renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts are not necessarily hard to find; the tricky part is <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finding the right one<\/a> for your renovation and communication style. Asking friends or searching through directories can yield many suggestions, but those general contractors may not be the right fit for your specific budget, your location, or your type of project.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s where our free service comes in. We help you find the best general contractor for your project, then monitor the project until completion. By posting your project, you\u2019ll be matched with general contractors who are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>licensed, insured, and vetted<\/li>\n<li>have experience with renovations like yours<\/li>\n<li>do work in your city, town, or neighborhood<\/li>\n<li>are already interested in your project based on its budget and scope<\/li>\n<li>guarantee their work<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Read about <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how our free service works<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Get at least 3 estimates to compare<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with most things in life, you should shop around a little. As a general rule, it\u2019s smart to have at least three bids, (also known as estimates) from different general contractors for your renovation. Not only will this allow you to find the best contractor for your budget, but you\u2019ll be able to find the \u201cright fit\u201d in terms of working style and personality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Bids often come in different formats from different contractors. We offer a free <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bid-leveling phone call<\/a> with our renovation experts to help analyze any bids you&#8217;ve received from Sweeten contractors as well as outside firms. We&#8217;ll also offer insight into Sweeten contractors and their communication style.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Choose the best general contractor for you and start renovating<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you have met with all of the candidates, reviewed bids, discussed them with your spouse, partner, or housemates (and maybe Sweeten!) and decided on the best option, it\u2019s time to sign the contract. At this point, you will typically pay a percentage (25 to 50 percent, depending on the length and overall budget of the project) upfront. The contract will also set up regular intervals and milestones at which future payments are due.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, it\u2019s time for the fun to begin!\u00a0Knowing how to plan your renovation successfully means starting with this basic list, and, when you\u2019re ready, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posting your project to find a contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated on April 13, 2023<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
