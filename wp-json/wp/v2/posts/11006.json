If you&#8217;re ready to turn those daydreams into reality, the first crucial step is creating a bathroom remodel budget. To get you started, <span class=\"s2\">Sweeten<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> offers a roadmap of elements that will impact the cost of a bathroom remodel in New York City. Sweeten&#8217;s guide to bathroom remodeling costs, covering building requirements, permits, and design will help nail down your scope and better align real costs with a realistic budget.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/new-york-city-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractors in NYC<\/a>, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Take a look at the overall average cost to remodel a bathroom in New York City, based on Sweeten renovations:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Budget remodel: Starting at <b>$600\u00a0<\/b>psf (per square feet) or <b>$21,000<\/b> (based on a 35-sq-ft space)<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700\u00a0<\/b>psf or\u00a0<b>$24,500\u00a0<\/b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850\u00a0<\/b>psf or\u00a0<b>$68,000\u00a0<\/b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pro tip:<\/b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">While it can be tempting to apply \u00e0 la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you\u2019ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you\u2019ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">How much will materials for a bathroom remodel cost?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Wall and floor tile<\/b>: Budget \u2013 <b>$3 per square foot (psf)<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$15 psf<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$35 psf<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sink:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$50<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$150<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$500<\/b> and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Vanity:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$250<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013\u00a0 <b>$1,000<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$2,000<\/b> and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sink and shower fixtures:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$40<\/b>\/fixture, Mid-grade\u2013 <b>$100<\/b>\/fixture, High-end \u2013 <b>$350<\/b>\/fixture <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Bathtub:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$150<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$600<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$2,000 \u2013 $3,000<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Shower enclosure:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$350<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013\u00a0 <b>$1,000<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$2,000<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Toilet:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$150<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$400<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$1,000<\/b> and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Medicine cabinet:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$50<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$150<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$500<\/b> and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Accessories<\/b> (hooks, towel bar, paper towel holder): Budget \u2013<b> $10<\/b>\/item, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$50<\/b>\/item, High-end \u2013 <b>$100<\/b>\u00a0 and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Lighting:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <strong>$25<\/strong>\/fixture, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$150<\/b>\/fixture, High-end \u2013 <b>$300<\/b> and up <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Ceiling vent:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$50<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013<b> $200<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$500<\/b> and up<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><b>Radiant floor heating:<\/b> Budget \u2013 <b>$6 psf<\/b>, Mid-grade \u2013 <b>$8 psf<\/b>, High-end \u2013 <b>$12 psf<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"mb-48 alignleft wp-image-48266 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Item-Bathroom.jpg\" alt=\"Chart of bathroom remodel costs for a low-range, mid-range, and high-range bathroom remodel project\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1060\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Item-Bathroom.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Item-Bathroom-283x300.jpg 283w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Item-Bathroom-600x636.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3><\/h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren\u2019t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/nyc-alteration-agreement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">alteration agreements<\/span><\/a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s6\">Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYC contractor Thomas<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> explained, \u201cBuildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.\u201d The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel<\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 \u2013 $3,500<\/b> and higher <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 <\/b>and as high as<b> $5,000<\/b> per permit <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Electrical permits: <b>$900<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 <\/b>to<b> $1,000<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City\u2019s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 <\/b>and as high as <b>$5,000<\/b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 <\/b>and<b> $3,500<\/b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900<\/b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 <\/b>to<b> $1,000<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">approval process<\/span><\/a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub\/shower, and lighting. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000<\/strong>. This is because you\u2019ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project\u2019s construction costs for his or her fee.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor\u2019s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000<\/b>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building\u2019s \u201cstack\u201d (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600<\/b> to<b> $900<\/b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000<\/b>). This is critical for the project\u2019s foundation alignment and infrastructure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cGL_uAFyKzE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<h4>Installation<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you\u2019ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class=\"s2\">Sweeten contractor Thomas<\/span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Overhead costs<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor\u2019s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3568#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYC contractor Aaron<\/a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;bathroom remodeling new york&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:577,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0}\">Bathroom remodeling costs in New York in 2021<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials.

The finish level available from big-box stores like Home Depot and Ikea will put your renovation at the low end of the price range. Custom, hand-made, and imported specialty materials will push you to the high end.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1638353791087\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong>How much does it cost to retile a bathroom?<\/strong><\/strong>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Not counting the cost of demolition (removing old tile and grout), count on paying between $3 and $35 per square foot, depending on the type of tile. Basic ceramic tiles will fall on the low end of this range (~$3 PSF). Most stone tiles, and higher-end ceramic tiles will land in the middle of the range (~$15 PSF).
