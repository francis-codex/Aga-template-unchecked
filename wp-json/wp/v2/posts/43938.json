We both love architecture and design, and we wanted a place that we could make our own. The previous apartment, with its sunny balcony and endless closet space, had given us high standards, and working in real estate, I look at beautiful homes all the time. We wanted a home where we could make our mark and add the elements we craved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43743 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg\" alt=\"homeowners in their newly renovated living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Portrait-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Portrait-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Portrait-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We were thrilled when we landed on this one-bedroom apartment, in a 1930s Chelsea co-op. The building had great bones and Art Deco details but the apartment needed work. We\u2019d been following Sweeten, and after closing, when we knew the reno was imminent, we looked to the service for direction. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">We wanted to create a clean, modern space marrying traditional and contemporary design elements accented with our personal twists. Throughout, we planned to incorporate art and photos from our travels.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Living in<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> the apartment for about half a year and bringing<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> our Sweeten contractor onboard brought the project into focus. We wanted to rethink the closet layouts and planned to <\/span><span class=\"s4\">update the living room\u2019s custom built-ins<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. We were also looking for a lighting solution since the courtyard-facing unit didn\u2019t get much natural light. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Last but certainly not least, we planned to improve the kitchen and the <\/span><span class=\"s4\">bathroom<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">A<\/span><span class=\"s1\">dditional cosmetic and electrical updates included new doors and hardware and USB outlets throughout the apartment. Our contractor was patient, listening to our thoughts (lots of them), answering questions and\u2014most of all\u2014assuring us that he could get the job done, within our time constraints and with the level of quality we were hoping for.<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Closets and storage came first. We\u2019d known when we purchased the apartment that we were in for a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/closet-renovation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">major storage deficit<\/a>. With our contractor\u2019s help, we found we could reconfigure the hall and bedroom closets, which backed up to one another. We moved the interior wall, creating a larger bedroom closet with<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> French doors (sliding doors can restrict access)<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. Downsizing the hallway closet felt like a sacrifice, but we outfitted the space for linen-and-shoe storage\u2014useful and enviable extras in NYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43739 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"washer dryer in kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Jessica-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The kitchen was one room where plans changed. It had been renovated and we hadn\u2019t planned on a gut-job. We love to cook and entertain, and didn\u2019t want to forego full-sized appliances, but we wanted more cupboard and counter space. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">We ultimately did a full rip-and-replace<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. The cabinets are <\/span><span class=\"s5\">an <\/span><span class=\"s1\">off-the-shelf pick that we stacked to the ceiling; it was like putting together a giant puzzle, but was good for our budget and timeline, and gave us a ton of storage. The cabinet above the dishwasher was a last-minute call to increase pantry space. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">Q<\/span><span class=\"s1\">uartz countertops and <\/span><span class=\"s5\">a slab backsplash <\/span><span class=\"s1\">give us a marble look without the maintenance<\/span><span class=\"s5\">. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">A narrow galley kitchen? Yes. And we love it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The <\/span><span class=\"s4\">old &#8217;70s <\/span><span class=\"s2\">bathroom remained, and it <\/span><span class=\"s1\">was a full demo and redo<\/span><span class=\"s2\">. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">We replaced the peach and yellow bathroom tile, <\/span><span class=\"s2\">which appeared to be original to the <\/span><span class=\"s1\">building, with marble subway tile, <\/span><span class=\"s2\">placed vertically for some spin. We played with metals, choosing<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> an unexpected iron vanity (the countertop is quartz) and chrome hardware. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">The floor tiles are porcelain, sleek and durable.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s2\">The rear-facing apartment was pin-drop quiet, but dark. The silence was <\/span>a luxury to us, having endured roaring sunrise garbage pickups and the revelry of late-night barhoppers. But the long living room, which also comprises the dining area, had just two windows and<span class=\"s2\">\u00a0no built-in light fixtures. <\/span>We installed recessed LED lighting in this room and it brightened the area so perfectly that we added it in the bedroom, the bath and, finally, the kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The existing built-in cabinets spanning the windowed wall in the living room<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">provided additional storage and brightened up the room with a fresh coat of white paint. We removed a floating center unit to accommodate a wall-mount TV.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To finish, our Sweeten contractor detailed with all new doors and hardware and added t<\/span><span class=\"s5\">hose USB outlets, which become more useful every day. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">It was our idea to hang wallpaper in the foyer; the subtle raffia gives the walls texture and depth. We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint. But it was so helpful to have an expert to guide us. There are a ton of vendors out there and our contractor had relationships with suppliers and experience with almost <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cr3uihyuiUo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">any material available<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Our advice as first-timers is to do the research and know what you want but keep an open mind!\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Seeing the work progress day-over-day and week-over-week was amazing, a<\/span><span class=\"s5\">nd we\u2019re so thrilled with the outcome! <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Adding our stamp to this place was fun and fulfilling.
