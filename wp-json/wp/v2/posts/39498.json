Recently, the building\u2019s management let her know that there was a major leak behind the walls. Since a portion of the bathroom would have to be demolished to identify the source and then fix the leak, she decided to go through with a full gut renovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was looking for a reputable and reasonably priced general contractor who would not only do a great job, but that I could fully trust and who would be flexible given\u00a0the\u00a0nature of the situation,&#8221; she shared. While resolving the issue and fixing the leak was the most important element of the project, the homeowner also wanted to make cosmetic changes to match the luxe, timeless, and high-quality feel of the rest of her renovated home.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-bathroom-with-glass-doors\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48809 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg\" alt=\"White bathroom with glass doors before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><strong>After<\/strong><\/span>: The homeowner <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/admin\/projects\/32036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted her project to Sweeten<\/a> and received multiple matches and bids. When she met one of her matches in person and \u201cthought he was too good to be true,\u201d the homeowner requested references she could speak to directly. \u201cHis references described him as someone who was honest and trustworthy, hardworking, easy to work with, did high-quality work, and would do whatever it took to make a client happy,\u201d she said. After <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">matching with the general contractor<\/a>, she soon found out the references were spot on.<\/p>\n<p>They tackled the renovation together, focusing first on repairing the leak and subsequent damage, and from there, honing in on the look and adding more storage. She consulted with a designer,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.damonliss.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Damon Liss<\/a>, who helped out on her previous renovation, and he suggested where to go for materials. Ultimately the finishes were selected to be cohesive and consistent with the rest of the home. That meant lots of natural and marble stone, plus polished chrome hardware.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The homeowner went to the Kohler experience store and worked with a salesperson to select fixtures.<\/span>\u00a0She gave up a bit of shower space to add in a bigger vanity and decided against centering the sink to maximize counter space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"marble-countertop-wall-tiles-and-brass-faucet\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-39740 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03.jpg\" alt=\"wood bathroom vanity with white marble countertop and undermount sink with brass faucet and white marble tiles on wall and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"walk-in-shower-with-glass-wall-door\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-39744 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-07.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom vanity with marble countertop and toilet below window and walk-in shower with glass wall and door after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1492\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-07-201x300.jpg 201w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-07-600x895.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brass-shower-head-and-fixtures\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-39745 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-08.jpg\" alt=\"white marble tiles on walls with brushed brass shower head and fixtures next to a window and corner shower stone shelves after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Homeowner-T-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><br \/>\nThroughout the experience, there were those expected, and otherwise, challenges that the general contractor helped her navigate. For example,\u00a0when they waterproofed the shower to meet New York City code, the building engineer informed them that the\u00a0building\u00a0had a higher standard than the city. An additional layer of protection\u00a0would be needed to meet the building\u2019s standards. The general contractor quickly took action to make the necessary updates. He also stepped into conversations with suppliers to move things along and paid close attention to the project status throughout the process. The homeowner was particularly concerned about an involved renovation and construction process going on in the already-finished home. \u201cMy general contractor and his team took\u00a0great care with my\u00a0apartment, built trust quickly, and drove a high\u00a0standard on all\u00a0aspects of the project,&#8221; she shared.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the renovator did have to move out of her home for the project to be completed, her general contractor and his team made the whole process easy and manageable. \u201cEven my building management and suppliers were blown away by his professionalism, work ethic, attitude, and quality of work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOverall, I\u2019m really happy with the result and how the process went,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bonus<\/strong><\/span>:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cI will only ever buy something that I can renovate,\u201d the homeowner said.
