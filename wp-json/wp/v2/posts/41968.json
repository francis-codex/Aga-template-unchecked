For the first nine years, I lived in a large cookie-cutter rental building with two roommates, and first started looking into buying about three years ago. There were two motivating factors behind my search: The first was that I felt it was time to have my own place. I had lived with roommates since I was 18, and it was a great way to save money on the margin, but I was ready for a change. I had always thought that owning my own place in New York would be a proud moment and an important milestone in my life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40507 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04.jpg\" alt=\"studio floor plan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The second reason was financial, as I had seen our rent increase over $1,500 in my time there. That was a tough pill to swallow, but at least manageable when splitting it with a roommate. I didn\u2019t want to put myself in that position if I lived alone, however. I had saved enough money over time <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to cover a down payment<\/a> and soon found myself checking the real estate websites on a daily basis to find the \u201cperfect\u201d apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"den-with-partition-wall-before-renovation\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-40504 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-01.jpg\" alt=\"living space or den with hardwood floors and windows and short partition wall before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40512\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-04.jpg\" alt=\"living area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40513 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-05.jpg\" alt=\"junior one bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-05-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>A one-bedroom with a lot of light<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My two main requirements were that the apartment had one bedroom and good light. I also wanted to stay in Hell\u2019s Kitchen so that I could still walk to work. But I quickly realized that there was no such thing as a \u201cperfect\u201d one-bedroom apartment in my price range, and anything that was close to what I wanted would go into contract within days of the initial listing. Competition was stiff.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then, one day, after a year or so of looking, I decided to look more seriously at alcove studios with the idea of putting up a wall to create a one bedroom. I ended up finding a studio that was listed as a \u201cjunior one bedroom\u201d on the top floor of a 1930s co-op in Hell\u2019s Kitchen\/Clinton. The kitchen and bathroom were a bit dated,\u00a0 but that was less of a priority for me.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect it to look as good as it does.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More importantly, the current owner had already set up a large built-in bookcase to separate the bed area from the general living space\u2014so you couldn\u2019t even see the bed\u2014and there were windows on both sides\u2014two large ones facing north with trees offering privacy into the interior space and three large windows facing east toward my neighbor\u2019s apartment. This was the exact studio layout I needed for my conversion into a true one bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40505 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40515 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07.jpg\" alt=\"breakfast bar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-07-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Junior one-bedroom remodel takes longer than expected<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The original timeline was four to five weeks, but the project ended up taking eight weeks to complete. (A heads-up to first-time renovators: It does cost more and takes longer than you expect. It\u2019s New York City, after all, so you need to account for this variability). In my case, part of the extended timeline was due to Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My contractor helped in two ways though\u2014one strategic and one tactical. First, it\u2019s important to have the support of the co-op or building super for a renovation, and my contractor ensured that all of the co-op building work rules were met. Second, I would leave \u201cto-do\u201d lists each night toward the end of the renovation outlining items that I wanted to be addressed. I would then return the following day with each having been taken care of.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"integrated-built-in-dishwasher-in-kitchen\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-40521 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-13.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with white cabinets and black floor tiles and window and integrated built in dishwasher after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-13-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Maximizing the layout of a cramped kitchen<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Updating the kitchen was a big part of the reno (and a big portion of the budget). The existing galley kitchen was from the 1980s and extremely small with little usable counter space. We maximized the layout so that it flowed better and felt less cramped. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The location of the stove and refrigerator were swapped. It not only provided more functional surfaces but we added an additional 14-inch ledge of counter space by the window. It had the effect of creating a wraparound spot where I could fit a stool and use it as a small breakfast bar.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40517 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg\" alt=\"penny tile backsplash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-09-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Light colors welcome a gleaming shine<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the kitchen is still small\u2014about 60 square feet\u2014I kept the colors very light. I chose white shaker cabinets with brushed nickel pulls, stainless steel appliances, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/primer-kitchen-countertops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low-maintenance Caeserstone-type quartz<\/a>\u00a0(spilled red wine and coffee won&#8217;t stain). The counter material has modest strains of gray, gold, and brown, and complement the blueish-gray penny tile for the backsplash. The large gray floor tile helps elongate the small space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I was excited (and partially anxious) to see the various parts come together as a cohesive final product. I only had an idea of how everything would work together. The wall is fantastic and looks like it was always there. My contractor matched all of the crown moldings to the originals in the apartment. Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect it to look as good as it does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40510 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg\" alt=\"junior one bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">It was important that the new full bedroom design maintain the apartment\u2019s natural light. It also needed to be large enough to fit a queen-size bed comfortably and allow me to walk around without any issues. My goal was to have a real wall creating two separate rooms and not look like a temporary or flex wall.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40506 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg\" alt=\"bedroom before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40514 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06.jpg\" alt=\"A modern junior one bedroom renovation with pocket door\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Peter-Demoise-Kitchen_Bed-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that I\u2019ve finished my renovation, I suggest letting your design-build team know upfront what your priority is. For example, I was less focused on the timeline as long as the work was done correctly. And ask questions! Communication is critical and you don\u2019t want to assume anything.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Living in his junior one-bedroom during renovations<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I actually chose to live in my apartment throughout the renovation process. The only night I did not stay was the first day of demolition. I would not recommend this for everyone though. I was largely motivated to put the money I saved, from not renting a place for 1-2 months, back into the renovation. (I had originally thought my budget would be enough for a kitchen, bathroom, and wall; however, I had to remove the bathroom from the scope upfront.) My contractor was very accommodating as this was likely a nuisance for him to clear a path for me to walk in and out to my bed every day. It was clear to me throughout the renovation process that my design-build team wanted me to be happy with the finished product.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I wasn\u2019t able to find the perfect one-bedroom at first, and I learned that nothing will be perfect, but I am extremely satisfied with the end result while staying within budget. Now, I\u2019m proud to call the apartment my home and, even though I set out to live alone, my next plan is to adopt a dog or cat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Paul, for sharing your very own new home!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation materials<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Floor tiles, cabinets, countertops, backsplash, and sink: <a href=\"https:\/\/expressbrooklyntile.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Express Brooklyn Tile<\/a>.

This allows for the apartment to be compartmentalized and helps create a more organized layout. A junior one-bedroom apartment can be an affordable option for someone looking to live on their own and who wants a studio with additional privacy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to remodel a junior one-bedroom apartment<\/h4>\n<p><span>Looking to renovate your junior one-bedroom apartment while keeping costs down? A recommended approach is to convert a junior one-bedroom apartment into a true one-bedroom apartment layout. Because junior one-bedrooms have partial walls, the walls show where the room can be created and closed off by completing the wall line. Additionally, simply closing off the wall allows for fewer structural changes overall, or the need to rethink the entire apartment layout.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Six Sweeten renovators maximize and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/6-bedroom-ideas-to-remodel-your-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bring a cozy vibe to their bedroom<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
