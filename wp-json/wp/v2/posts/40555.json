Sally had already been through three renovations in other homes. She typically looked for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spaces in fixer-upper condition<\/a> (and at an \u201cunrenovated\u201d price) versus buying a recently remodeled home that was not her style. \u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I know that I can invest in my renovation, get the look and functionality that I want, build equity in my home\u2014and be satisfied with the aesthetic because it\u2019s my design,\u201d she shared.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"ikea cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40344 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>An inconvenient kitchen<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1,100-square-foot home was definitely in need of a renovation. Luckily, it had good bones: hardwood floors, thick plaster walls, and high-coved ceilings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They decided to wait to renovate and see if they should keep the existing galley footprint. It became clear that as a two-cook household, Sally and Ross needed more open space, as they could never fit in the kitchen simultaneously. When the dishwasher was open, it blocked the fridge. Plus, the storage situation wasn\u2019t working. Case in point? To find small appliances in the lower cabinets, Sally had to get on her hands and knees with a flashlight, pulling everything out and back in again.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>High marks for contractor communication<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After five years of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">envisioning the kitchen transformation<\/a>, Sally <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted her project<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to Sweeten, received <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/queens-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">matches to Queens contracting firms<\/a>, and interviewed candidates.

These were things that were going to come up, and we were going to have to pay for; he was just calling them out ahead of time. I appreciated that,\u201d Sally shared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40350 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-585x878.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen plans took shape<\/a>, she had two design plans: one with the kitchen totally open to the living area, and, Plan B, a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/decisions-galley-kitchen-renovation-queens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">galley style with a partial wall<\/a>. During a walkthrough with her contractor and building manager, they discovered water supply, disposal, and gas lines that couldn\u2019t be moved without disrupting service to the building. That meant Plan B, which (spoiler alert!) Sally ended up loving. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The vision without the price tag<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sally wanted all-paneled and integrated appliances that felt more like furniture. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found myself gravitating toward kitchens that banked all the tall pantries with the fridges to one side, like Poggenpohl. Henrybuilt has a sleekness I coveted, with its signature absence of wall cabinets and a ubiquitous shelf running along the tops of the slab stone backsplashes. I fell in love with the shaker cabinetry of Plain English, their wonderfully functional sink islands, and use of slab marble,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40343\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-44860 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;If I\u2019d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn\u2019t, I knew [Sweeten was] there to advise and help me out.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The marble backsplash, which Sally referred to as \u201cthe star of the show,\u201d consists of two consecutive slabs. A fabricator book-matched them to create the dramatic arc just above the center of the cooktop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen design on budget<\/a>, they designed the kitchen using the IKEA planner tool and sent a PDF of the design to a cabinet manufacturer who outfitted the IKEA cabinet boxes with all custom doors. Opting for stock bases saved the couple $25,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg\" alt=\"brass and marble kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45246 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overall flow improved greatly, thanks to the separate wall ovens and cooktop. Plus, with the refrigerator outside of the main cooking area, it\u2019s easy for guests to grab drinks. The refrigerator is also flanked by tall pantries and cabinets that hold cleaning supplies. Similarly, a narrow unit stores brooms and mops, and all of the base cabinets have deep drawers with organizers. There\u2019s also a unit of freezer drawers, ideal for Sally who batch cooks on the weekends.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Researching contractors with Sweeten<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sally had a strong perspective and sense of what she wanted for her kitchen renovation, and she found a contractor who brought her vision to life. \u201cThe number one thing I did right was to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire the right contractor<\/a>,\u201d she said.

Resist the urge to choose the trendiest or fanciest option at every single decision point. You want one thing, like a marble backsplash, to stand out as the focal point, then maybe a few smaller things, like brass cabinet hardware that picks up the brass in the faucets or in the light fixtures. Let the rest of your choices be the plain backdrop that lets these few gems shine,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40349\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"broom closet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-in-all, the renovation finished without a hitch.
