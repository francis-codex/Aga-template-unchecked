They do most of the hard work, right? And they are big purchase items. Nevertheless, there is one feature that, while it plays a supporting role, is indispensable: the utility room sink or laundry sink. Manufacturers are designing these basins specifically for the laundry room, offering many features with benefits.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What distinguishes\u00a0a utility sink from other sinks? They are extra deep to allow vigorous scrubbing or spraying of water with minimum splashing outside the basin. These sinks typically start at 10 inches and go up to as much as 25 inches deep versus a bathroom sink of six to eight inches deep. They come in a square or rectangular in shape, putting every inch of the basin to work. However, not all utility sinks are made alike. To determine\u00a0the right choice, you&#8217;ll want to look at style and materials, taking into account what tasks will take place there and what sorts of cleansers or liquids the sink will be exposed to.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Placement plays a factor in your decision, too. Keep the wet zone intact. The sink should be near the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/the-washing-machine-is-more-than-spin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">washer<\/a>\u2014right next to it, if possible. This allows you to keep the plumbing lines together. It also means you can transfer soaked or pretreated items with a minimum of a drippy mess. The location may lock you into a particular size, and prevent you from getting that vintage double basin you had your eye on. That\u2019s okay. Since a utility sink can come super deep, your choice will have the capacity to soak a grass-stained soccer uniform or a gravy-smeared tablecloth.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the extra features available in some versions, such as a drainboard, or a second basin, you really can get a lot of use from it. Here\u2019s what to consider before committing.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46407\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png\" alt=\"Get Matched With Contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Choose your utility sink style<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with bathroom sinks, the laundry sink comes in a variety of styles for installation. What you choose from the list below has to do with personal taste, as well as any extras you may\u00a0like.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Wall-mount utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a good option if you want to keep the floor area clear, as there is no need for a structure, such as a cabinet or legs attached to the bowl, to hold up the sink. You\u2019ll find vintage designs, like white enamel-covered cast iron, from manufacturers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanstandard-us.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Standard<\/a>. Cast iron is strong and it won\u2019t dent, and the enameled finish resists scratches and chipping. <a href=\"\/\/www.us.kohler.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kohler<\/a> offers a double basin that almost looks like a trough. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elkay.com\/us\/en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elkay<\/a> makes an institutional model\u00a0out of stainless steel with a built-in drainboard.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Freestanding utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name indicates, this style stands on its own, supported by integrated or bolted-on legs or held in a washstand-style support of a stainless-steel frame with legs. You can find models with built-in drainboards as well. The advantage of\u00a0this type of sink is its portability. You can move the entire unit wherever you want, even the garage, as long as you have a hookup to water. Like the wall mount style, the pipes are concealed, and you don\u2019t have to replace a cabinet for support below.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Self-rimming or drop-in utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the simplest and thriftiest choice, this sink drops into a countertop and the sink is complete once the plumbing and faucet are hooked up. There\u2019s no seam around the sink\u2019s perimeter to catch grime.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Undermount utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good choice when you want a seamless, smooth appearance for your countertop. The sink rests below the counter surface and almost disappears.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Apron-front utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This style was popularized in country-style or vintage-style kitchens and the look carries over well to the laundry room. The apron front is nice for deflecting water splashes when you&#8217;re standing before the sink\u2014much like an apron.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Agitator utility sink<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some personal items may be too small for the delicate cycle of your washer or require just a quick swish with detergent. <a href=\"https:\/\/mtibaths.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MTI<\/a> makes a laundry sink with a micro-jet (like a whirlpool tub) that gently agitates\u00a0the items for you.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What is the best material for a utility room sink?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with style, the selection here is informed by personal taste. However, each material offers its own pluses.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Stainless steel<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This material won\u2019t stain. It also won\u2019t chip or fade and has a little give, so anything you drop inside it\u2014like a vase\u2014is less likely to break than it will on enameled cast iron. All in all, a smart choice if you like the look of steel.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Enameled cast iron<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The enamel\u2014a baked, powder-coated finish\u2014coats cast iron, making it one of the strongest sinks available. This type of sink resists scratching, chipping, and staining. The enamel<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives the super-rugged cast-iron surface a warmer-looking finish. Though impervious to water and resistant to stain, prolonged exposure to harsh bleach could blemish the surface. If you drop something hard on it, the enamel\u00a0will chip or crack. It\u2019s also the heaviest sink, so make sure it has sufficient support before you install it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Solid surfacing<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stain-resistant, durable, and warm in appearance, solid surfacing can stand up to a wide variety of tasks. Dings and scratches can be gently sanded out, but enlist a professional to do this, or the abraded surface will show. It can stain, too, despite some manufacturers\u2019 claims, so best to use it for washing only.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Adding a utility room sink to your home<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many benefits to a dedicated utility sink in the laundry room of your home. That said, washing machines come with gentle and delicate cycles, so despite all the conveniences, is a utility sink truly necessary? That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a utility sink; there are a lot of uses besides laundry. To name a few: handling cut flowers; potting plants; bathing a pet; washing dirty hands (or shoes) after garden or garage work; rinsing a mop; running water for crafts projects. You get the idea.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46407\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png\" alt=\"Get Matched With Contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><em><strong>IKEA, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Cabinets To Go<\/strong>&#8230;which is the best for cabinets?
