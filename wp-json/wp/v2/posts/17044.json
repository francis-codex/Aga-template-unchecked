But this lovely home\u2019s kitchen was relegated to a tight little galley, and though the finishes were once beautiful, the dark and heavy cabinetry blocked light and cut access to the living and dining rooms. Eric, the new owner, came to Sweeten to find a contractor who could smoothly navigate the management requirements in this pre-war building and bring a serious carpentry and craftsmanship approach to flow and finishes in the kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-17046 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/eric-kitchenV2.jpg\" alt=\"custom wood cabinets\" width=\"600\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/eric-kitchenV2.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/eric-kitchenV2-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making real design changes to a pre-war pad can prove rather daunting &#8211; many of Manhattan\u2019s most sought-after buildings have deep historical roots, celebrity architect imprints, and cautious alteration agreements that limit updates. Eric saw an opportunity to open up the kitchen in his new place and <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/3122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted his renovation project<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Sweeten &#8212; we matched him with <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1368\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten Expert Alan<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a cabinet and millwork specialist who could also manage strict building requirements and oversee all aspects of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For Alan, designing new custom cabinetry to lighten the space was the easy part. Finding a way to incorporate more natural light and reconnect the rooms was the primary challenge. Eric had hoped to take down the entire wall separating the kitchen and living room where the paneled fridge stood, but the building\u2019s interior pipes stood in the way, so the crew decided to open the wall with a large pass-through instead. The team also planned to replace floors throughout the apartment and targeted the old-school linoleum in the kitchen as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17057\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alan stripped the black and white linoleum squares and laid white oak planks down in their place, finished with a glossy clear stain throughout the entire apartment. The cabinets were torn out and replaced with a detailed custom oak set, mostly constructed and completed onsite. Incorporating a lot of glass into the design, Alan created open, closed, and shelving variations in a combination of natural-stained and painted white finishes. The new pass-through provides light from the kitchen window and the living room windows in both directions, and Alan played up the new light with windowed display cabinets above the counter and bar.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17049\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"manhattan galley kitchen\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17052\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"bar counter kitchen remodel\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-04.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17050\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"custom cabinetry\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the partial wall and new footprint more functional, Alan moved the refrigerator to the adjacent wall and constructed a food pantry to mimic the rest of his oak cabinetry, finished with heavy metal hardware and pulls. Ivory Caesarstone countertops replaced black granite, and an undermount brushed stainless steel sink with matching faucet were installed. Because the kitchen\u2019s back wall is so visible from the living room, the team went with a neutral, luminous glass-tiled backsplash and open shelving above the sink. New stainless steel appliances, including a hefty gas burner, contrast with the warm wood and are easy to keep clean. Alan took Eric\u2019s vision for more light very seriously, adding a number of under-cabinet and recessed sources, as well as a striking ceiling fixture centerpiece. As a bonus, Alan constructed a bar counter on the living room side of the pass-through, perfect for open entertaining. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17051\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen open shelving \" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-03-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17053\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"glass tiled backsplash\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-05.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-05-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17054\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"oak cabinetry\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-06.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-06-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17055\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg\" alt=\"eric sweeten homeowner\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-Portrait-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huge kudos to the team for transforming a cramped and dark kitchen into a warm, inviting, and sophisticated open living room with beautiful style!
