They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pro tip:<\/b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p6\">How much does it cost to remodel a home in Miami?<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re renovating a house in the Miami area, expect costs to range from <b>$100<\/b> to <b>$250+<\/b> psf with <b>$175<\/b> psf as the middle range for a full-scale remodel. If you&#8217;re aiming for a budget that is in the upper-middle-range, Miami-based<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6382#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Sweeten general contractor Adrian<\/span><\/a> said you can expect to pay over <b>$200,000<\/b> or about <b>$200<\/b> psf. However, several elements affect this, like square footage, the state of the original home, and how expensive your tastes are. &#8220;It has all to do with the finishes,\u201d Adrian said. By finishes, he means the elements you can see such as tiles, faucets, and kitchen countertops. With materials, plan to add to the timeline for installation and materials and labor costs. Using higher-end finishes will push your budget upwards by at least $50,000, he said. With the pandemic, material and labor costs have gone up due to higher demand. \u201cThere\u2019s been a 20 percent in materials,\u201d said Adrian.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The budget for renovating an apartment can be higher than house renovations. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a house, often you can work on the weekends,\u201d said Adrian. In a condo, there are tight rules about when construction work can and can\u2019t be done. These hours are put in place by the<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/a-guide-to-an-hoa-before-you-own\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><span class=\"s3\">homeowners association<\/span><\/a> (HOA) for each building. Often, this means only working within an eight-hour or so window Monday to Friday. This extends the timeline of a project, thus increasing the budget. HOAs might also charge a condo owner a fee to remodel their apartment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Disposing of trash adds to the cost of condo renovations. With a house, a general contractor can park a dumpster out the front. For condo remodels, general contractors will likely hire a separate contractor to come and lug construction trash away. This involves negotiating tight hallways and elevators as well as timeframes given by the HOA.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p6\">How much does it cost to remodel a kitchen in Miami?<\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">A kitchen renovation in the budget value range can come in starting at <strong>$150<\/strong> psf or <b>$15,000<\/b>\u00a0for a space measuring around 100 square feet, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6366#overview\"><span class=\"s3\">Hancen, a Sweeten general contractor<\/span><\/a> in Miami. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners should look at materials like pre-made shaker-style cabinets and appliances from big-box stores like Home Depot. \u201cI\u2019ve also noticed a trend for concrete countertops,\u201d said Hancen. \u201cThese can be cheaper than quartz, but they take more to maintain,\u201d adding that a sealant needs to be applied annually.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">For a mid-grade kitchen remodel in Miami, Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$325<\/strong> psf or <strong>$32,500<\/strong> for a 100-square-foot room. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a mid-range kitchen remodel costs on average<b> $73,645<\/b>. This works out to <b>$368<\/b> psf for a 200-square foot space. Almost 54 percent of that cost is recouped in the value it adds to a home. The example kitchen the report gave was 200 square feet with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than the addition of a kitchen island, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6512#overview\">Sweeten general contractor Domenico<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, also servicing Miami, recently completed a kitchen renovation in this price range. It included a countertop made from Dekton, a stain-, scratch-, heat-, and UV-resistant material. The cabinets were custom with self-closing doors, which took <b>$40,000<\/b> from the budget. The appliances were from GE.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten has seen high-end kitchen renovations in Miami start at <strong>$650<\/strong> psf or <strong>$65,000<\/strong> for a 100-square-foot space. The 2021 Cost Vs Value Report quotes <b>$145,718<\/b> for this finish level, adding the same amount of value to a home\u2019s resale value\u201450 percent\u2014as a mid-range kitchen remodel. This included custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also upgraded, including a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, plus designer faucets and a water filtration system. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p6\">How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Miami?<\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">At the budget level, expect a solid rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to come in starting at <b>$10,500<\/b> for a 35-square-foot room. Contractor Hancen specializes in bathrooms for the Miami area. He has completed a very basic 50-square-foot bathroom for <b>$300<\/b> psf, he said. However, this is contingent on the layout staying the same and having no issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. If you\u2019re after this price, stick to a prefabricated vanity and ceramic tiles, which come out to about <b>$2<\/b> psf. When it comes to faucets, toilets, and bathtubs, the brand American Standard is a good example of affordable, quality products. \u201cThese are the most well-priced materials I\u2019ve seen and the most popular,\u201d said Hancen. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">The next step up is a mid-grade bathroom renovation. Expect the starting costs for this finish level to be <strong>$570<\/strong> psf or <strong>$19,950<\/strong> based on a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average cost for this type of bathroom remodel in Miami is about <b>$22,567<\/b> and about <b>$644<\/b> psf. The example bathroom the report gave was a 5\u2019 x 7\u2019 space and involved installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a lit and recessed medicine cabinet. A renovation in this vein can add about <b>$12,051<\/b> to a home\u2019s value. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">A high-end bathroom remodel in the Miami area starts at <strong>$630<\/strong> psf or <strong>$22,050<\/strong> for a 35-square-foot space. According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, the average price in this category is around <b>$70,286<\/b>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You\u2019re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom drawers, and wall cabinets. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of tiles can add up. On a recent project, Domenico\u2019s client picked out a tile that had the appearance of wood and cost <b>$20<\/b> psf. Another client wanted a wave pattern created out of tiles. \u201cIt was more difficult to install adding to the labor costs,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, breakages happen, so that also needs to be covered.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is this is an investment with about 48 percent of the budget added to your home\u2019s sale price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding outdoor space to your home<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In Florida, there is plenty of sun and enviable weather to take advantage of by renovating or adding an outdoor space to your home. Many Miami residents will use these spaces as an additional living space and even kitchen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">For one project, Sweeten contractor Adrian added a 900 square foot patio to a house that had a budget of <b>$50,000<\/b>. \u201cIt was essentially another room to the house without the walls,\u201d he said. It had a tiled roof supported by four columns, which was necessary so the structure could withstand a powerful hurricane. The flooring was Cuban tiles and there were fans and lighting so electrical work was required. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">According to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report, a 16&#8242;<\/span> x 20&#8242;\u00a0 wood deck costs <strong>$15,216<\/strong> and <strong>$20,879<\/strong> for a composite one in the Miami area. <span class=\"s1\">If you went for a simple wood deck in a simple linear pattern, you could recoup close to 67 percent of the budget in the bump it gives to your home value. For this price, you could get a built-in bench and planter with stairs and railings. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\"><\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Permit costs in Miami<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of permits, from a typical building permit to electrical, mechanical, and plumbing permits, are calculated in<span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.miamidade.gov\/permits\/library\/fees\/building-fee-schedule.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">different ways<\/span><\/a>. Some permit costs are calculated by square footage. Some are calculated by the value of a project so an exact figure can take some time to figure out. That\u2019s why general contractor Adrian puts an estimate in the initial budget. For example, with a <b>$250,000<\/b> renovation, he puts a budget placeholder of <b>$1,500<\/b> for the main building permit with an additional <b>$500<\/b> each for plumbing, electrical and mechanical, if the project requires it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Miami-Dade county covers a huge amount of land and almost three million people. Each city\u2014such as Miami South and Miami Lakes\u2014in the county has a building official who issues permits for projects located within that city\u2019s jurisdiction. Residential permits typically take 30 business days to process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These Miami remodeling costs are a launchpad so you can begin creating an initial budget. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/a-renovation-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten\u2019s Renovation Checklist<\/a> is a downloadable<span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><span class=\"s3\">roadmap to organize<\/span> all of the moving parts of a renovation.
