The\u00a0creatives\u2014Michael designs sweaters and\u00a0Chenta is a director in web design\u2014were drawn to a warm but minimalist look, and knew immediately how they could alter the apartment to achieve their desired surroundings. The prewar industrial building was situated in Ridgewood, Queens, right on the border of\u00a0Brooklyn, and dated back to 1932. It also briefly housed a school, and then was converted to condos in 2009. The structure&#8217;s\u00a0original industrial elements, including steel beams and wood materials, concrete floors, high ceilings, and great expanses of windows, were preserved in the conversion. The space was everything that Michael and Chenta were looking for, with an interesting history to boot.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Portrait-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25184 size-full\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Portrait-03.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Portrait-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Portrait-03-300x191.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Portrait-03-600x381.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25191 size-full\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-01.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25185 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"living room with concrete floors\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While they were in contract on the property, Michael and Chenta began reaching out to general contractors independently, but felt overwhelmed. They would call contractors and hear nothing back. Michael then <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/12757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted his project<\/a> to Sweeten\u2019s site,\u00a0explaining they wanted to reveal the concrete floors under beaten-up hardwood planks, and to create a new closet system for the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">master suite<\/a>. The couple was matched with several experts, and ultimately\u00a0decided on their\u00a0Sweeten\u00a0general contractor. The contractor\u00a0and her team worked with the duo\u00a0to achieve the right combination of concrete, wood, metal, and paint colors to produce what Michael called a \u201cmodern Scandi style, but without the Boho elements.\u201d They wanted \u201cclean and simple lines, but we&#8217;re also trying to not make it look too cold or sterile.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25192 size-full\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25181 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"living room and kitchen with concrete floors\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of the biggest changes, the contractor\u2019s team first ripped up the wood flooring to expose the concrete floors underneath on both levels of the duplex. They next applied an Italian product called Wall2Floor, a concrete-based mineral coating that had to be applied by hand to the existing substrate. The application creates a seamless surface and is usually used in luxury spaces. It gave the apartment floor a polished, sleek texture and paired nicely with the wooden banister and kitchen cabinets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To continue the streamlined effect, Michael and Chenta asked their Sweeten contractor to remove baseboard moldings and door frames. This accentuated the gallery-like feel of the loft space: walls were floated\u2014meaning that the drywall stops short of the floor, and is not covered with base moldings, and when closed, doors were completely flush with the walls that surrounded them. Their choices of warm white paint in the living area and dusty pink in the living room provided a warm contrast against wood, metal, and concrete.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25193 size-full\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-03.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25186 size-full\" title=\"bedroom with concrete floors\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-03.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a>(The new wall behind the TV separates the clothes closets from the bed area creating a &#8220;walk-in&#8221; closet feel.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25188 size-full\" title=\"closet and concrete floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25187 mb-0\" title=\"closet and concrete floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the master suite, they made layout changes to accommodate a walk-through (rather than walk-in) closet. The existing closets on the left wall were demolished, and a floating wall was created to section off the closet area without closing it completely. \u201cIt\u2019s all very open with a lot of natural light,\u201d Michael explained. New custom closets were designed with metal framed interiors and floor-to-ceiling oak doors and placed to face the new wall. They also opted\u00a0to paint the walls inside the closets dark gray for more depth. All the hardware was finished in a matte\u00a0black. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like any of the standard finishes, so our contractor made the changes to help us achieve the clean lines and simplicity that we were looking for,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25189 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"concrete floors and stairwell\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg\" alt=\"concrete floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-07-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the process, Michael and Chenta worked with their Sweeten team\u00a0to ensure that each step was smooth. But like many\u00a0renovations, there were\u00a0some hiccups: they had to move in before the renovation was finished since they didn\u2019t want to continue paying rent when they had started paying their mortgage. They waited until the concrete floors were finished (and protected with a plastic sheet), and then <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lived through the rest of the work<\/a>. \u201cAll our moving boxes were stacked in the middle of the living room, and we were sleeping on an airbed in a construction site,\u201d describes Michael. Despite this, the couple felt that their contractor \u201cwas great from the beginning. She understood our vision and always had great ideas. She was the kindest person and talked us thoroughly through the process, even when Chenta and I had meltdowns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michael\u2019s advice to would-be renovators? \u201cStay calm and put some money aside. It will work out in the end, but you will be over budget. It was a system\u00a0that we weren\u2019t familiar with, and although I understand how to\u00a0create a product, I didn\u2019t realize just how complex it would be to renovate an apartment. It takes so many steps to even properly <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/interior-painting-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paint<\/a> a wall! And all these little things need to be done to create a great end result, although they seem unnecessary when you are not familiar with the process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to Michael, Chenta, and their cat Taiger for sharing their showcase apartment with us!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RESOURCES.
