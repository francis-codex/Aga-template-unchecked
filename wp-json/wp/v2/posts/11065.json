And if you\u2019re on good terms with your board and superintendent, it may be easier to arrange the bureaucratic and logistical intricacies of a renovation than if you\u2019re the new kid on the block.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re on good terms with your neighbors who will stay good neighbors\u2014even through the construction noise.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be able to avoid broker fees when staying in the same building and buying directly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Reasons not to combine apartments<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re limited to the immediately adjacent units, the abutting spaces may not be conducive to a smooth flow, depending on layout restrictions. You might end up with awkward hallways or bedrooms off the kitchen.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The board might be unhappy to have too high a percentage of ownership concentrated in one person\u2019s hands, and in turn, prove difficult about the approval process.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will take on additional maintenance and taxes, and the combined charges may appear unusually high to potential buyers for resale.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, you will have to pay the carrying costs on both apartments for the duration of the renovation (possibly without being able to live in either!).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to merge two apartments in a new location, you\u2019ll face the same cons, as well as the need to finance two home purchases.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Should you combine apartments? Ask yourself these questions.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners with adjacent apartments have the luxury of multiple layout options, but also need to work within a unique set of constraints to create the new space. In any unit-combining project, you\u2019ll have to consider the following questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is a combination even possible?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not all buildings allow combinations. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check the building&#8217;s alteration agreement<\/a> for allowances. And in those that do, before you buy, bring in an architect and\/or structural engineer to assess whether your dream can be made a reality. Don\u2019t assume that you can knock down that wall! As one Sweeten contractor points out: \u201cYour ability to probe for structural elements prior to construction can be limited by building requirements and existing tenants, and building records are notorious for omitting elements of the building\u2019s composition, so you have to work with your architect to prepare for unforeseen conditions.\u201d Although there is a limit to what can be deduced without actually starting demolition, a consultation will give you a sense of what you can do and how much it\u2019ll cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are you combining horizontally or vertically?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Horizontal combinations are typically easier, because it can be as simple as knocking through a non-structural wall to make a door-sized opening and removing one kitchen (NYC code only permits one kitchen per apartment, although certain exceptions can be made).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vertical combinations (duplexes) are more complicated because of structural considerations and the possibility of electrical and plumbing systems hidden in floors. And don\u2019t forget the staircase! It can take up more space than anticipated and require the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring of a few renovation experts<\/a> (architect, structural engineer, contractor, millworker) to design, approve, fabricate, and install.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten homeowners, Zoe and Arvid,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> completed a horizontal combination in Lincoln Square.

You\u2019re typically allowed to merge units in either co-ops or condos, but different approvals and filings are associated with each. In both, however, you\u2019ll have to deal with requirements from the building as well as the city.<\/p>\n<h4>Building requirements for combining apartments<\/h4>\n<p>Get in touch with management to make sure that you have a comprehensive list of all the building requirements. Most buildings will also require architectural plans first to be submitted to the board for approval. Some will have template alteration agreements in place, which can be adapted to your specific project. These will have details about permissible work hours, protection of common areas, whether there are \u201cwet-over-dry\u201d rules, as well as information about the costs associated with approvals, security deposits, and other building fees.<\/p>\n<h4>City requirements for combining apartments<\/h4>\n<p>A myriad of codes govern apartment combinations, and New York City has put together <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/assets\/buildings\/pdf\/code_notes_combining_apt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resources to guide homeowners through the process<\/a>. Still, you\u2019ll probably want to hire an expediter to help you navigate the process. Unlike simpler renovations, joining units will most certainly require permits from the Department of Buildings (DoB). For example, you\u2019ll need an ALT2 (Alteration Type 2) application for a permit to remove a kitchen, which involves cutting and capping all gas and electrical lines. For condos, you will also need to merge the tax lots on the two properties by filing an amendment to the condo declaration and offering a plan with the Department of Finance (DoF).<\/p>\n<p>A final note on approvals: homeowners tell us hold-ups usually occur in the building approval process, rather than with the city. This is because boards can make decisions \u201cas they see fit,\u201d leading to inexplicable delays, whereas the city permits process is well-regulated and navigable by an experienced professional, such as an expediter.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What to Expect When Combining Apartments<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the various moving parts of an apartment combination, allow for extra time and budget. \u00a0Give yourself a few months of wiggle room\u2014if your general contractor says that the project will take six months, plan for it to take eight or nine. Your contractor should be able to tell you at the outset of your project whether it would be advisable or possible for you to stay put. If you need to relocate, rent space nearby for at least that amount of time so that you\u2019ll have a debris-free home that\u2019s close enough to the construction site for frequent check-ins.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the process, just remember the prize: a beautiful, sprawling apartment customized just for you and your family to enjoy for years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Costs for Combining Apartments in NYC<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with other renovation projects, understanding the scope of your project is the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first step to creating a budget<\/a>. While apartment combination projects usually run in the six figures, let\u2019s start with a baseline scenario for a <\/span><b>horizontal combination<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for budgeting purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These numbers should be considered a minimum; most combinations will cost more. \u00a0If your project is a vertical one, there will be significant additional costs due to the necessity of a structural engineer and relevant permits. A vertical scope would be outside the baseline scenario outlined below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1.)<\/strong><b> Initial consultation<br \/>\n<\/b>You walk through the space with a pro, who will tell you whether a combination is possible and\/or advisable.
