There\u2019s a good reason for that. Boston is one of the oldest cities in America\u2014circa 1630\u2014and has cycled through many eras. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re planning to remodel your home and want to learn about the various costs to remodel in Boston, then Sweeten should be your first stop. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, <\/span><span class=\"s1\">a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, offers\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">a general cost guide to get you started on your first step: your budget. However, to get an accurate figure for your project, a contractor will want to see the space in person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s a quick overview of budgets for some typical renovation projects:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gut renovation: Starting at around <strong>$100<\/strong> psf (per square foot)<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$30,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$18,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$27,000<\/strong> or <strong>$770<\/strong> psf<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">High-end master bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$50,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Basement: Starting at <strong>$25,000<\/strong><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">How much a Boston remodel costs per square foot<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A total gut renovation in Boston that brings your home down to its frame will likely start at around <strong>$100<\/strong> psf.

This is about <strong>$10,000<\/strong> above the national average and works out to be <strong>$400<\/strong> psf. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with laminate countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Other than<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\"> adding a kitchen island<\/span><\/a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher were installed, remained the same as the original design.

The cost per square foot is <strong>$775<\/strong>. This type of project can add more than half that amount\u2014<strong>$85,000<\/strong>\u2014to your home\u2019s value. The scope at the budget range can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood. Designer faucets and a water filtration system were also part of the materials.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabinets are by far the biggest expense in a kitchen especially when they are custom made. According to Boston-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7012#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Jeff<\/a>, one client chose to spend <strong>$35,000<\/strong> on cabinets\u2014almost half the whole budget\u2014in an <strong>$80,000<\/strong> renovation of a small kitchen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appliances are also a big factor in the budget if you decide to spend a large percentage here and save in other areas.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Boston bathroom remodel costs per square foot<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The typical home renovation cost for a budget bathroom in Boston starts at <strong>$15,000<\/strong> and goes up to <strong>$18,000<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mid-grade bathroom: For Boston, the average cost of a mid-grade bathroom remodel is about <strong>$27,000<\/strong> or <strong>$770<\/strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class=\"s3\">report<\/span>. This budget could get you a remodeled 35-square-foot bathroom with a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add more than <strong>$16,000<\/strong> to a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/renovating-your-home-for-resale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home\u2019s value, recouping close<\/a> to 60 percent of the project\u2019s cost.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">High-end master bathroom: Renovation costs start at <strong>$50,000<\/strong> for a high-end master bath in Boston. According to Cost Vs Value,\u00a0 the average price is around <strong>$82,000<\/strong> or <strong>$820<\/strong> psf. You could afford to expand your existing bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You\u2019re also likely to afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like all renovations, your budget comes down to your choices, said contractor Jeff. And sometimes those choices will have a ripple effect on the budget. Tiles can range from <strong>$2<\/strong> psf at Home Depot or <strong>$100<\/strong> psf for imported tile. The cost and timeline can increase if the tile chosen requires specialized installation such as Italian mosaic tile which one of Jeff\u2019s clients ordered.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much it costs to renovate a basement<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\">A basement renovation starts at <strong>$25,000<\/strong>. The average cost is <strong>$88,000<\/strong>, the Cost Vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2017\/new-england\/boston-ma\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">report<\/span><\/a> found. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">The project for this budget includes a 20\u2032 x 30\u2032 main room and a 5\u2032 x 8\u2032 bathroom with a shower. The main room can contain a bar area as well as laminate flooring and insulation, a largely unseen but important part of the project to combat those wet, frosty winters. This example project works out to <strong>$137<\/strong> psf. <\/span><span class=\"s4\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s right in line with what Sweeten contactor Jeff estimates a basic basement\u2014walls, drainage, and electrical\u2014will cost for homes in the Boston area. The cost increases once you add a bathroom or a bar according to Jeff.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building permit costs<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the City of Boston, which covers over 200 square miles around the city center, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityofboston.gov\/images_documents\/isd%20fee%20schedule_tcm3-31721.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">permits<\/span><\/a> for a major residential remodel starts at <strong>$50<\/strong>. This increases by <strong>$10<\/strong> for every <strong>$1,000<\/strong> of the budget. There are additional charges for electrical and plumbing work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If your home is in Norfolk County then you will need to check the township your home is located in. The county is made of dozens of small towns and each has its own building permit system. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dedham-ma.gov\/Home\/ShowDocument?id=796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">in Dedham<\/span><\/a>, a permit for additions, including decks, costs <strong>$10<\/strong> per <strong>$1,000<\/strong> of planned work. This would mean a <strong>$30,000<\/strong> kitchen addition would attract a <strong>$300<\/strong> permit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Over in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridgema.gov\/inspection\/buildingelectricplumbingpermits\/buildingfees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Cambridge<\/span><\/a>, which is located in Middlesex County, a building permit costs <strong>$15<\/strong> per <strong>$1,000<\/strong> in the budget. So a permit for that same <strong>$30,000<\/strong> kitchen addition would be <strong>$450<\/strong> in Cambridge.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whatever your renovation plans are in Boston, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post your project<\/a> to Sweeten and we\u2019ll match you with fully-vetted general contractors.

To maximize savings, complete the entire project at once, rather than splitting it up over several years. However, with Boston\u2019s historically old housing stock, gut renovation costs may be higher than elsewhere with newer homes. Depending on the area, the choice in finishes, and the condition of the home or apartment, costs may reach $300 psf.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1639640035271\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Boston?<\/u><\/strong><\/strong>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">In Boston, budget-level kitchen remodels cost $15,000\u2014$30,000 on average. Mid-grade Boston kitchens can range in cost from $30,000\u2014$80,000, or roughly $400 per square foot. Higher costs usually coincide with larger square footage, but the final costs will also depend on the finishes and level of work needed. A high-end Boston kitchen remodel will usually start at $75,000 and go up dramatically; for luxury remodels, expect prices near $832 per square foot.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1639640050956\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong><u>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom in Boston?<\/u><\/strong><\/strong>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Costs for a Boston bathroom remodel vary widely: budget-level bathrooms start in the $15,000-$18,000 range; while mid-range bathrooms start closer to $770 per square foot, or $27,000 for a 35 square foot space.
