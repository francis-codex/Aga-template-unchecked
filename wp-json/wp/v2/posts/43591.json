I\u2019d only been to a handful of showings, but when I saw this place, I knew I wanted to make an offer. I have a soft spot for lofts, and the balcony made it a must-have. I\u2019d been <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">planning\u2014and saving\u2014to buy<\/a> an apartment for years, and it was a good thing I waited. The sellers were motivated. I put in a bid and pulled off the purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019d envisioned an overhaul that included renovating the kitchen and bathroom, modernizing the loft and stairs, and adding a giant wall-to-wall built-in of shelves and closets in the living room,<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0but it was once I was there that I clarified my goals. I realized I wanted to expand the kitchen, since I love to cook; I needed a larger kitchen peninsula that would serve as both a work and eating surface.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"carly-against-black-accent-wall\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43379\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Carly-portrait-1.jpg\" alt=\"photo of carly standing in front of a black accent wall after renovation\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Carly-portrait-1.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Carly-portrait-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Carly-portrait-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Although I left things like cabinet dimensions and stair specs to the professionals, I selected all the flooring, cabinets, [and other finishes].<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It dawned on me, too, that I wanted to raise the ceiling. One of the apartment\u2019s previous owners had actually <i>dropped<\/i> it by at least five feet, wasting space and blocking light. In my mind, high ceilings are pretty much universally beloved and will definitely add value when I ultimately go to sell the apartment. I saw that by reclaiming the height, I could enclose the sleeping loft, allowing it to feel private but still be bright. I designed the windowed loft wall by looking through Instagram and showing the drawings to my Sweeten contractor. He found a way to make the enclosure with sliding glass panels that transmit both air and light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I knew when I hired my contractor that I wanted to work this way, doing my own design work, and I was happy to find a contractor who would work with me. To say I was hands-on would be an understatement. Although I left cabinet and stair specs to the professionals, I handled most of the materials including the cabinets, tile, and appliances, as well as the layouts for each room (which was surprisingly time-consuming). <\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When it came to aesthetics, I stayed neutral, particularly in more permanent elements like flooring and cabinetry. But I have a huge interest in texture, and I was excited about mixing flat, modern, cool elements, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/stairs-that-are-a-real-design-treat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">steel staircase<\/a> and black cabinetry [a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popsugar.com\/home\/photo-gallery\/45662050\/image\/45662053\/Deep-Dark\">great way to create depth<\/a>], with warmer ones, like the wood-grain floors and golden-brown leather and upholstery.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">To achieve the look I wanted, we had to do the work. It was a challenge, with bumps. The worst came early, when we demolished the kitchen and found asbestos. Remediation cost about $6,000 and added three months to the timeline. I would strongly recommend asbestos testing during the diligence phase to any potential buyer. Had I tested up-front and knocked some of the abatement costs off of the purchase price, I would have saved money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">From start to finish, excluding the asbestos work, my renovation spanned five months. I moved out for several weeks when the contractor knocked down walls and raised the ceiling. For much of it, though, I was there. I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases and boxes. Luckily, my bedroom remained mostly untouched, so once the enclosure was finished, I spent my home time up there. I don\u2019t regret slumming it. The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I heavily underestimated how long the approval process would take. The time it took just to obtain the co-op board\u2019s approval for my plan was nearly six months. Staying in my rental apartment in hopes of a fast renovation was a big mistake. If I had it to do again, I would move in right after closing, live in my new space, and use that rent money for something meaningful. Hindsight is 20\/20!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">People have asked how I lived through the project. I think I blocked some of it out, but I do remember leaning on the Sweeten team after a few long construction delays made me feel frustrated and uncertain. They offered me a sounding board and helped me adjust my expectations, and as a first-time renovator struggling to parse out the delays, their guidance was immensely helpful. When needed, Sweeten contacted my contractor and helped to keep things moving smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite the difficulties, I love the way the place turned out. The raised ceiling, now about 16 feet high, changed the entire feel of the place. The library ladder, a functional addition facilitating access to the high cupboards, added a fun touch, and the loft enclosure made the bedroom feel cozy and intimate. My new kitchen has made cooking every meal a pleasure, and even the bathroom is beautiful, which is rare to say about a bathroom. There was stress and sweat, sure. But designing the space was one of the most rewarding things I\u2019ve ever worked on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, Carly, for sharing your home with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LIVING SPACE RESOURCES: Paint in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pure White (walls) and Decorators White (baseboards)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Benjamin Moore<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European oak wood flooring: Sourced through contractor.
