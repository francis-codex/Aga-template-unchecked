Though bittersweet, they were happy to keep it in the family. Chris grew up in the Rockville, Maryland house, so it held special meaning for him. Plus, the family was about to expand. Brandi was pregnant with her second, and her grandmother, Bernice, planned on moving in.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"blue-and-white-kitchen-with-fishbone-backsplash\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"Blue and white kitchen with fishbone backsplash overlooking the dining area after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51581\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a first-time homeowner, Brandi wanted to renovate the 1,643-square-foot house right away to make it fit their lifestyle. However, Chris had a special attachment to it and wasn\u2019t in a rush to remodel. The conversation was tabled for several years. Then, the couple started talking about having a second baby and the idea to renovate returned. This time, the focus was mainly on the kitchen. It was old and outdated. There was little storage space. They had improvised and put in temporary storage containers but they weren\u2019t ideal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brandi had also toyed with doing a few <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/the-cons-of-diy-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DIY projects as a facelift<\/a>. Mainly, a temporary backsplash and a fresh coat of paint. But, as Brandi put it, \u201cIf I\u2019m having a baby, I\u2019m having a new kitchen.\u201d That\u2019s when they turned to Sweeten.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"blue-and-white-kitchen-with-window\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"Blue and white kitchen with appliances and large window after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-and-blue-kitchen\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"White and blue modern kitchen with little girl sitting on the quartz countertop after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Local support for kitchen remodeling contractors in Maryland<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brandi was newly pregnant when she found Sweeten. She needed a service like Sweeten to take some of the stress off of the contractor search process. And it was important as people of color to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire a Black-owned general contracting firm<\/a>. Brandi met with two contractors outside of the Sweeten network but their estimates were too high. And there wasn\u2019t much room for negotiation. She would have to compromise on the design, which she didn\u2019t want to do. Her Sweeten contractor, however, gave her many options in order to fit her budget and style. \u201cHe was very thorough,\u201d said Brandi.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhen the wall came down, I was like, \u2018Wow\u2019,\u201d said Brandi. \u201cIt definitely opened up the space so much more.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09.jpg\" alt=\"White and blue kitchen cabinets with cooking range and fishbone tile pattern backsplash after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1508\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09-199x300.jpg 199w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-09-597x900.jpg 597w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"blue-and-white-kitchen-cabinets\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"Blue and white kitchen cabinets with undermount sink and a window after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMust-haves\u201d and compromise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A visit to California inspired Brandi with the idea of two-toned cabinetry. Blue on the bottom, white cabinets above. That was Brandi\u2019s \u201cmust-have.\u201d Chris wanted to knock down the wall between the kitchen and dining room as well as center the sink. Brandi thought these weren\u2019t essentials but for Chris, these were his non-negotiables. They were added to the design plan. \u201cWhen the wall came down, I was like, \u2018Wow\u2019,\u201d said Brandi. \u201cIt definitely opened up the space so much more.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Laying out the kitchen design details<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once the functional and structural details were settled, the kitchen\u2019s design plan came next. Storage would be the main focus for the two-toned cabinets. Brandi wasn\u2019t a fan of clutter and storage would hide the daily essentials. Chris had considered display cabinets but the couple decided against them. The kitchen wasn\u2019t very large so they needed to use the space as efficiently as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"dining-area-overlooking-open kitchen\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"Dining area overlooking open kitchen with bookcase on wooden flooring after renovation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"breakkfast-dining-nook-with-patterned-half-wall-paper\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-08.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast nook with patterned half wall paper and painting of laughing children after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51584\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-shelving-unit-with books\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-11.jpg\" alt=\"Black shelving unit with books and portable vinyl record player after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51587\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to the cabinets, the backsplash was one design detail that Brandi felt strongly about. She wanted a contemporary look and chose a chevron pattern. It was clean and modern in a white and gray color scheme. For the countertops, butcher block was considered because of its affordable price point. However, their Sweeten contractor was able to source a quartz countertop for around the same cost. The couple decided it would be an upgrade and went for it.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A refreshed Rockville kitchen brings renewed joy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Brandi and Chris are thrilled with their <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovated kitchen<\/a>. The open concept allowed the main floor to feel more comfortable for the expanding family. Brandi\u2019s grandmother and daughter can join in as meals are being prepared. And with an expanded family, the new space will be even more appreciated. For Brandi, it\u2019s the little details, down to the new blinds over the centered sink. Brandi said she goes in every morning and opens the blinds to let in the light and finds joy. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Ahhh\u2019,\u201d said Brandi. \u201cIt\u2019s like the house breathes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, Brandi and Chris, for sharing your kitchen remodel with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovation Materials<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES:\u00a0Cabinets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kraftmaid.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s8\">KraftMaid.<\/span><\/a> Dreamcicle marble and metal chevron backsplash tile: <a href=\"https:\/\/hd.jeffreycourt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeffrey Court<\/a>.
