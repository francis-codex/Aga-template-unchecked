Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purchased a one-bedroom apartment<\/a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cFor the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had\u2014before he even bought a bed\u2014was a pool table,\u201d recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console\u2014sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt\u2014was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who\u2019d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment\u2019s centerpiece.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical\u2014Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. \u201cI wanted to create more space around it,\u201d said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor\u2019s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation\u2014and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. \u201cWe\u2019d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. \u201cDark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cso we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.\u201d Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen bar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go \u201call in\u201d on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/primer-kitchen-countertops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">natural marble for the countertops<\/a> and backsplash. \u201cWe did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cOlive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.\u201d Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. \u201cFrom multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,\u201d Bennett said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening\u2019s living-room side. From there, the apartment\u2019s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett\u2019s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. \u201cThat awkward corner became a great opportunity,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.\u201d The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. \u201cGet the super involved early,\u201d he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you\u2019ll encounter.\u201d Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) \u201cI would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All challenges aside, though, \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the finished product,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"s1\">SHOPPING GUIDE<\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN: Porcelain floor tiles: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiledepotny.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tile Depot<\/a>.
