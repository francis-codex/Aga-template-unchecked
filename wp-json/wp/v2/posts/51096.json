I&#8217;ve been lucky to be able to work with what I love for as long as I can remember.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I love helping people achieve their visions to make a house feel like home. Meeting new people and seeing the way they think, their creativity makes the job a lot easier. It gives me great satisfaction to hear that we have gained a client&#8217;s trust for future projects.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in Los Angeles?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we have faced is getting the proper permits that allow us to commence a project.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clients seem to assume that because they already have most of the work in a house\/ condo\/ townhome done, that renovating should be quick and cheap. What they fail to understand is that if, for example, they want to remove walls, we have to get the proper permits to allow us to start the project, which can take longer than anticipated. Renovating can be quite expensive, having to get the proper plans, materials, basically starting from scratch.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We always want to let our clients know that they can trust us to work towards their visions. We want them to feel like they are part of our family.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clients should keep in mind that patience is the number one thing needed to start a renovation project. We try our best to help them understand the process, but they are always welcome to ask more questions.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As always, clients are welcome to call at any moment with questions or concerns. A project works best when all minds are at ease. We prefer for them to let us know if there are any issues so that we are able to work with them and fix any concerns.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite project that you\u2019ve done and why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My personal favorite projects are the ones where the client knows exactly what they want. I once did a bathroom project where the client had everything, including the material picked out for us.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would advise new general contractors to be specific in their contracts what the job will be and what they can provide. If there is any change whatsoever, make sure it is written and signed to show proof of consent.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles building?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My favorite building is the Walt Disney Concert Hall due to how visually appealing it is. It is a magnificent architectural accomplishment.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles neighborhood?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I love many buildings in LA, but my favorite city is probably Silverlake. I love the modern architecture that surrounds it.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles restaurant?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WP24 or 71Above are great restaurants, both with great views and beautiful designs.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>If you weren\u2019t a general contractor, what would you be doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would probably be a florist if I wasn&#8217;t a general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7093#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out the portfolio<\/a><span> of <\/span>Sweeten general contractor Ashley&#8217;s work.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Ashley has been a Sweeten contractor since January 2021.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div data-test-id=\"formatted-input-0\">\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
