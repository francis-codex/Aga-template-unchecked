She also created SAW (Sweeten Accelerator for Women), a mission to advocate and promote skilled women contractors. The aim was to shift the current professional model and help bridge the gender gap for established and growing firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, Jean offers a view into why she started SAW and the opportunities she sees for Sweeten to help women grow their construction businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Women already in the contractor role<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have personally seen a lot of women go into interior design or architecture and work in these industries for many years. What I saw was that we were frequently doing the job of the general contractor: managing subcontractors, choosing materials, or coming up with construction details. It&#8217;s so obvious to me that women are already doing that work\u2014and just not being compensated for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sweeten-saw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reason why I started SAW\u2014<\/a>and why I started Sweeten in general\u2014because I believe that internet technology and the web allows for new access points. It allows for new opportunities. In the past,\u00a0 a woman would have had an incredibly hard time becoming a general contractor, getting clients, or hiring the subcontractor networks they needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now there&#8217;s so much transparency and opportunity. Sweeten provides that job deal flow that can help a woman-led general contracting firm not only in its first few years of business but also as the company continues to grow. We are so excited to support that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Including daughters in the conversation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The general contractor and the construction industry have long been dictated by nepotism and through union participation. Union participation is related to commercial work and we don&#8217;t typically do that type of project. In residential, however, it&#8217;s mostly through nepotism. Fathers would hand down their construction businesses to their sons\u2014an intergenerational transfer. In some ways, Sweeten\u2019s platform can help with the mentorship and tutelage to help women grow their businesses.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conversations with our male general contractors, we have said, &#8220;Hey, you should think about giving this business to your daughter.&#8221; In fact, we have one in our network right now whose daughter went to architecture school. I said, &#8220;Your daughter should take over your business.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s so funny you&#8217;re saying that. I was just having that conversation and didn&#8217;t even think that she would want it.&#8221; And she does.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Breaking the contractor stereotype<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the power of storytelling and our blog, we\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highlighting the incredible projects<\/a> that our women general contractors have completed and are really changing the narrative around what the job is. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job of a general contractor\u2014it is logistics, it is communication, it is delegation. You have to marshal labor and materials to a job site and orchestrate the labor and the materials to come together to finish a project. You do not need to swing a hammer. You do not need to be a burly guy. Whenever the image of a general contractor is, it is a false one. Those executive functioning skills, women are great at that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all those reasons, it was clear to me that a program like SAW needed to exist. We\u2019re so excited to be able to support these women general contractors. Hopefully, it will encourage more women to join the industry because they have the skillset for it. It&#8217;s a great profession and offers a path to small business ownership. The hours can be very flexible if you have children at home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Building a flow of work<\/h3>\n<p>Our women general contractors do not have a problem with getting hired by homeowners. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge is when women need to secure additional subcontractor labor and get them to work on their projects. Subcontractors still have a very outdated idea about who a general contractor is. The good news is that if there is a steady deal flow and steady work, money does talk. They can break that up really quick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Read more about Sweeten&#8217;s women general contractors and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see their work and reviews here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
