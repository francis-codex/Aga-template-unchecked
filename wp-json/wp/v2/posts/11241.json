Outdoor spaces present an increase in living space and an upgrade to lifestyle. However, not all backyards are ready for \u201cprime time\u201d and a remodel is in order. NYC landscaping costs for the backyard include scope, flooring, demolition, fencing, electrical, and structures.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Fortunately, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/outdoor-space\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">every outdoor space can be improved<\/a> substantially with some great ideas and expert help. Our guide will help you understand the most common elements to consider in NYC with some tips from our <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractors.\u00a0<\/p><h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Building an outdoor space: where to start<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Outdoor space runs the gamut from a simple patio to a full outdoor kitchen. What you can achieve at your home is going to be limited by three main factors: space available, your budget, and building codes. Of those three factors, codes might be the most perplexing\u2014and least flexible.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For the most part, building codes exist for safety and you can either comply or change the design. They\u2019re not that onerous for most outdoor projects, but you might face challenges from setbacks, for example. That means you can\u2019t build right up to the property line in certain cases. Once you <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/new-york-city-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">choose a NYC contractor<\/a> to work with, your GC\u00a0will be invaluable in guiding you through design decisions that meet your desires <i>and<\/i> codes.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Space available and budget are easier to grasp. When your contractor gives you a good idea of the buildable space and rough estimates for your \u201cmust-haves\u201d and optional features, you can get going on your plan. Do a deep dive and check out projects that appeal to you. Creating a photo montage of completed projects that get you all frothy is a fun way to design!<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg\" alt=\"Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p><p>(<em>Above<\/em>) General contractor Santiago renovated this <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">backyard space<\/a> for Sweeten homeowner KV Harper<\/p><h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Backyard landscaping cost: Outdoor flooring\u00a0<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Knowing how you want to use your space is the first step to setting the budget. The outdoor-room concept is multi-faceted. Some people don\u2019t want much besides a table for meals, others want to sunbathe, some want a spa, and the cooks want a full kitchen. Whatever your wants, you\u2019ll have to start at the bottom: what you walk on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have an existing patio or roof to use, great, then you can move on to other elements. If your space does need some help with the flooring, though, you\u2019ll find a host of possibilities. One of the most popular options, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3191#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten contractor Santiago<\/a> in New York, is bluestone patios. This material is durable and beautiful, if fairly expensive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Bluestone pavers cost<\/span><\/h4><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Bluestone is a natural stone paver that offers beauty, durability, and flexibility. Cut bluestone pavers will cost from around $8\/square foot for 1\u201d thick stone and is available in many sizes. Smaller stones of about 12\u201d square will give you a slightly different aesthetic than huge slabs, and are definitely easier to work with. Access can be a challenge in the city, and you might have to spring for a crane if you want large, heavy stones. There\u2019s just no other way to move them in tight spaces. This process will cost you at least $2,000, not including the stone and site preparation. Smaller sizes are more manageable, though, and can be hauled by hand if necessary.<\/span><\/p><h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Concrete pavers cost<\/span><\/h4><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To spend less, \u201cConcrete pavers are available in dozens of size and color options for $4\u20135\/square foot,\u201d Santiago said. In addition, they don\u2019t need a crane for installation. Installation for both concrete and stone pavers will be the same, with costs varying depending on the current base rather than the material you choose.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calculating your backyard landscaping costs<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/nyc-landscaping-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">Determining your <\/span><span class=\"s2\">backyard landscaping costs<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s1\"> are also determined by demolition work. That type of work will vary by what you have in place now, so contractors don\u2019t want to guess on costs. Do you have an existing patio that must be removed? Or grass? How good is the access? Are you working on the ground floor or higher up? <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There are so many variables that rough estimates without seeing the site aren\u2019t possible, our contractors said. They need to see what\u2019s there first and learn what you want before they can give an estimate. <\/span>Post your project on Sweeten to discuss the possibilities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have to look at the job; two jobs are never alike. Labor is not easy to price. There are a lot of elements factoring in,\u201d Santiago noted.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">NYC-based Sweeten general contractor Steve concurred, saying that there are backyard remodeling jobs where all materials have to come in and out through the front door. \u201cA lot of the time you have to take the garbage out through the first floor, out the basement, or out the window. Everything has to be protected.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg\" alt=\"Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50575\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p><p>(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowner Jessica&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/backyard-deck-goes-wall-to-wall-in-brooklyn\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deck renovation<\/a><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to patios, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decks are popular<\/a> and sometimes do not require demolition and hauling out old materials. Decks can offer great flexibility in fitting into existing spaces, and they can also be particularly budget-friendly by overlaying an existing shabby concrete slab, saving the cost and hassle of demolition and removal.<\/span><\/p><h3>When to start planning your outdoor space<\/h3><p><span>Enjoy your green space for the summer by starting the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the Fall, begin planning with an architect\/designer\/contractor on design, landscaping, and materials. By December submit permits, hire your contractor, and order materials (keep delivery times in mind). Demolition should break ground by March\/April. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. Although an outdoor kitchen requiring plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals vs a deck remodel.<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Creating fencing and perimeter walls<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Fences and walls, too, are basic elements of most projects, and serve several functions. Privacy is usually a main concern, but view control and wind control are also important. Most people opt for wood fences, said Steve. As for design elements, \u201cPeople in general want big wide planks; materials that are more architectural looking, with bright backgrounds,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt depends on each client. Some people want a lot of space for seating. For all intents and purposes it\u2019s an outside living room,\u201d he noted. Fences offer a lot of design freedom, as well, including horizontal and vertical elements, natural wood tones or painted surfaces, and using wood, stone, and\/or metal. \u201cMost people do wood fencing,\u201d Sweeten contractor Santiago said, \u201csome choose pressure-treated, while others opt for cedar. It depends on the budget.\u201d<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Outdoor lighting <\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Some details, such as lighting, are easy to overlook at first. It\u2019s a major element in both ambiance and useability, however, and should be tackled at the design stage rather than tacked on later.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cEveryone is into lighting,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cFor this, you&#8217;ll need to factor in outlets. Floodlights can accent the plants. They can be simple but very cool.\u201d Lighting and electrical are simple and easy compared to some other elements, but they require planning for running buried lines and removing overhead lines. When your contractor has a design for you, then it\u2019s time to consider the lighting based on function. Lighting in the dining area is different from lighting for walkways and for plants. It\u2019s all part of the design process.<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding pergolas and arbors<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">As another distinct element, pergolas and arbors provide shade, structure, and beauty to your outdoor room, as well as an often-needed vertical feature. Arbors are simple and small structures that often frame a pathway, while pergolas are larger and more substantial, sometimes attached to the house. You might train vines or climbing roses on the arbor, for example. Pergolas can use a slatted, cloth, or solid roofing material, making them flexible so you have both sun and shelter in your yard.<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Landscaping front yard<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> options<\/span><\/h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In New York City, front yard spaces aren\u2019t as common, but you can still add natural beauty. In addition to using fine materials for your front entry, steps, and railing, do you have room for planters? If you like plants, this is a great option for tight spaces and lets you add some color and texture. If live plants are too much work or tough to keep alive, planters can also house durable and seasonal items like spruce tops.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You can see a multitude of high-quality planters and pots online, and talk with your contractor about building some that fit your space exactly. Many people choose cedar for this project, as it\u2019s beautiful and relatively rot-resistant. Other woods work fine, too, and can look great finished in paint or stain. Add your ideas to your photo montage and discuss with your renovation team.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Landscaping costs<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> for homes in New York City can be tough to estimate without a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visit from several firms<\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home or outdoor remodel, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">work with the right local contractor<\/a> to get you to your dream space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p3\"><em>Updated on June 19, 2023<\/em><\/p><p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-72a08b9 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"72a08b9\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-9eb6a7d\" data-id=\"9eb6a7d\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-30bac38 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"30bac38\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Popular Questions Asked<\/h3>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-1a49964 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"1a49964\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-50ea696\" data-id=\"50ea696\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-034c8cc elementor-widget elementor-widget-toggle\" data-id=\"034c8cc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"toggle.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle\" role=\"tablist\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-3451\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-3451\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" class=\"elementor-toggle-title\">How much does it cost to renovate your backyard?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-3451\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-3451\"><p class=\"p1\">There are many variables to renovating a backyard. A general contractor will need to view the site and walk through your wish list before an estimate can be given. If you\u2019re building from scratch, popular flooring includes bluestone pavers ($8\/square foot) or concrete ($4-$5\/square foot). Other costs depend on the nature of the demolition required and if any perimeter fencing or structures, like pergolas, will be installed. Costs will increase if outdoor lighting requires running buried electrical lines. The contractor uses these factors and more to determine labor costs.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-23d6eb1 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"23d6eb1\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-row\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-d81979b\" data-id=\"d81979b\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-21c6003 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"21c6003\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u2014<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
