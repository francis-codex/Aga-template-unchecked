The original cookspace occupied a corner spot, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new kitchen plan<\/a> entailed a single-wall layout opening up to the living area.

The six-month renovation spanned multiple rooms, allowing for a rearrangement and modernization of the condo&#8217;s layout, including the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom closet.<\/p>\n<p>The contractor ensured the electrical system was up to code, installed solid oak wood floors, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">facilitated the addition of a washer and dryer<\/a>.

However, advised of a high likelihood for more water damage, they agreed to a more sturdy version with an elegant black trim.
