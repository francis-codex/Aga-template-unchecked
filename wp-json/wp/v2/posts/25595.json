Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll even include questions that I get asked most often\u2014even at cocktail parties!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today, our question is about brownstones, and if this topic interests you, be sure to check out Part 1 of Nazli&#8217;s post on her and her husband Larry&#8217;s full gut four-story townhouse reno, a story filled with helpful insights and a refreshingly candid take on their experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>QUESTION: What should homeowners\u00a0keep in mind before jumping into a brownstone renovation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>JEAN:<\/strong>\u00a0I think most people get really excited about the interiors, especially as New Yorkers. We\u2019re used to mostly having apartments or spaces where\u00a0we are pretty much focused only on the interior. But the big change comes when you go from a regular apartment renovation to a brownstone renovation or an actual piece of property, and you\u2019re still tempted to focus on the interiors. After all, that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be fun&#8230;that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to live.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I highly recommend people fall in love with all the details of their roof, and all the details of their basement\u2014places where apartment dwellers\u00a0usually rely on\u00a0a super and don&#8217;t ever have to worry. So when you\u2019re thinking about a brownstone renovation, really look at the integrity of the roof and the integrity of the basement. Those are the areas\u00a0you want to\u00a0get right before you even start on the interiors. Every time it rains, you don&#8217;t want your heart skipping a beat wondering if your roof is leaking. Or if it&#8217;s raining\u00a0hard, you don&#8217;t want to be stressed out worrying, &#8220;Oh my god, is my basement flooding?&#8221;\u00a0So fall in love with the roof and the basement. Because that\u2019s really the difference. Yes, you\u2019re getting a ton more space, and yes, you\u2019re getting a backyard, but start at the top and the bottom.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Jean-Signature-1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-35417 mb-0 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Jean-Signature-1-723x387.jpg\" alt=\"Jean signature\" width=\"723\" height=\"387\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Jerry and Janet&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historic brownstone<\/a> needed major work,\u00a0including a facelift of the building&#8217;s exterior, so they turned to a gut renovation with the goal of creating the perfect mix of old and new.<\/p>\n<p><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
