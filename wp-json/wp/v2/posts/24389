It\u2019s the hub of the kitchen. It\u2019s the refrigerator. No other appliance sees so much action.\u00a0To keep up with all of the demands made on this hard-working member of the household, manufacturers are devising new\u00a0features and improvements to provide more\u00a0flexibility and responsiveness. From precise climate control to wireless connectivity, the refrigerator has even greater capacity to keep food fresh and to alert you when items need replacing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While some of these innovations may not be mandatory to a functioning kitchen, they are nevertheless time-saving. They also happen to be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Door configurations<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The arrangement of doors and drawers on your refrigerator, or refrigerator\/freezer, are not just a style choice. The configuration directs how you use the fridge, and what foods you reach for most often. Classic arrangements still exist\u2014side-by-side, bottom-mount, column\u2014as well as newer styles, like French door and drawers. When choosing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">style<\/span><\/a>, first make a checklist of all the things you and your family take from the fridge in a given day. Each configuration has its benefits:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">*Side-by-side<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Giving access to the freezer on one side and the fridge on the other, this type is the most popular category now. The tall slender doors are also good for kitchens with little clearance space. The narrower sides do mean you lose the capacity to stow wide items like pizza boxes and party trays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">*Bottom-mount freezer<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">With the freezer on the bottom, the main compartments remain at eye level, a no-brainer when the fridge is accessed more frequently than the freezer. For those times when you need the freezer just as often\u2014during a big party, over the summer, or for frozen snacks\u2014some fridges with two upper doors can be reprogrammed so that one side becomes the freezer, temporarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several manufacturers, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lg.com\/us\/home-appliances\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LG<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.geappliances.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GE<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mieleusa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miele<\/a>, offer double lower freezer drawers; one of the drawers can be converted to a fridge or freezer as needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">*French door<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A variation of the bottom-mount freezer category, this model features two half-doors that open from the center (like a side-by-side), also good if you have less clearance when a door opens. You\u2019ll still be able to get the full-width shelves in the inner compartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">*Column<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This refrigerator comes in a variety of widths so it can be installed wherever you want for a customized kitchen layout. Add a column freezer next to it or a couple of under-counter freezer drawers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">*Door-in-door<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Frequent opening of the fridge door is inevitable. This leads to strain on the cooling system and a risk to food placed at the front. If yours is the family that goes in and out all day for drinks, check out the fridge from LG with the upper door that opens with the push of a button to access a slender outer beverage compartment. A\u00a0tinted glass panel lets you see inside with two knocks on the glass, for those who like to graze with a gaze while deciding what they want.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">*Drawers<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Undercounter<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0refrigerator drawers are handy for a variety of situations, including small kitchens without much wall space, as well as a large kitchen requiring more fridge capacity for dedicated items, like drinks and snacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">*Top-mounted freezer<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This type falls into the most economical category (remember your starter apartment?). However, it offers the least capacity, and you have to bend over to retrieve most items in the fridge. Not so cool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Cooling for all<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10103\">The constant opening and closing of the fridge places a burden on the cooling system of the refrigerator\u00a0and on the food inside. The variety of items also presents a challenge, as not all perishables keep well at the same temperature\u2014or even together in the same drawer. Some foods, placed together, can even speed each other\u2019s spoilage.<\/p>\n<p id=\"m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10105\">Manufacturers have responded with independent humidity and temperature control for compartments. Miele makes a refrigerator with drawers that offer individual microclimates. With the touch of an icon, the drawer will keep lettuce crisp one week and safely store cheese another. Jenn-Air has a quick-chill feature that lowers the temperature to below liquid freezing for one hour, great for that spur-of-the-moment bottle of wine.<\/p>\n<p id=\"m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10196\">Some new fridges come with separate cooling circuits for refrigeration and freezing sections. The benefit: Independent control of each section contributes to peak function. Since there\u2019s no air exchange between compartments, it also keeps food from drying out.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.subzero-wolf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/www.subzero-wolf.com\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497730836836000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9637qnK0KHCvDfmC45nx5IwTHQg\">Sub-Zero<\/a>\u00a0has introduced an antimicrobial filtration system that clears airborne bacteria and prevents the transferring of odors or ethylene gas (emitted by some vegetables) that can speed food spoilage.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Connect with your appliance<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p id=\"m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10467\"><span id=\"m_6442250483863752054yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1497642992296_10466\" style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/kitchen-appliances-worth-hype\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1497730836836000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPscZMocam8VAD8OTg4CWdnfFPQA\">Linking home appliances<\/a>\u00a0to smartphones and other wireless devices allows convenient remote operation of some tasks.
