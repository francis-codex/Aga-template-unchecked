After selling my share of a business in the energy sector, I was approached by a friend to work for his construction company before starting my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you love most about what you do?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">I love designing, enhancing, and seeing a satisfied customer&#8217;s face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is the biggest challenge about being an NYC contractor?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Dealing with things out of our control is a challenge, such as the lead times on materials and the DOB process. Sometimes the DOB makes errors leading to unexpected delays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">There&#8217;s a misconception around not understanding the budget and the time required to complete a project. Homeowners can also carry with them the memory of a bad experience of a previous contractor who did a poor job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Our most important attributes are transparency, managing expectations, communication, and customer service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What\u2019s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Construction is far from perfect but we make up for it through our communication style and how we make adjustments when issues arise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Quickly and through email, text, phone, or our job tracker application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite project that you\u2019ve done and why?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">I renovated a brownstone in Brooklyn where the homeowners were extremely hesitant to hire us because of the cost. It was hard to win them over because of poor experiences they&#8217;ve had previously. It was a gut renovation of an entire brownstone and resulted in being a phenomenal showpiece. It was great to see how satisfied they were with their decision and how the space was completed converted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Be transparent and really know your craft before making promises that you find out later you can&#8217;t keep. This leads to mismanagement of expectations and upset customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite architectural structure?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Arc de Triomphe in Paris<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite NYC neighborhood?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Manhattan<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite\u00a0NYC restaurant?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">11 Madison<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you weren\u2019t an NYC contractor, what would you be doing?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#8217;d be in real estate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7190#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Click here to see<\/i><\/a> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten general contractor Peter&#8217;s work.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Peter has been a Sweeten contractor since August 2021.\u00a0<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
