The smaller square footage would be less overwhelming than a larger one. Choose a graphic pattern to add drama to a neutral space. Alternatively, a subtle design can add just the right amount of interest.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understandably, the moisture issue is often what causes renovators to hesitate. Whether a powder room or a full bath, wallpaper in bathrooms is now often made to withstand water conditions, thanks to improved adhesives. Plus, there are vinyl, waterproof wallpaper options. Even many non-vinyl wallpapers are washable (in case of soap or toothpaste stains), water-resistant, and scrubbable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most bathrooms have some kind of ventilation\u2014either an exhaust connected to your heating\/cooling system or a window. As long as there isn\u2019t lingering humidity in the room, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. Here, Sweeten showcases 12 renovations with expressive walls.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Wallpaper in bathrooms with bold looks<\/h3>\n<div>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">(1st slide) Artist Katy Garry channeled interior designer Dorothy Draper, known for her use of exuberant color and pattern, for her <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first-floor bathroom<\/a>. She loved the surprise of opening the door to Dorothy Draper&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dorothydraperhome.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brazilliance Grove Stripe Green wallpaper<\/a> and a chartreuse-painted ceiling. Katy joked to her husband \u201cthat splurgy wallpaper was more important than running water.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(2nd slide) With no need for a bathtub on the parlor floor of this Tudor townhouse, interior designer <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meredith<\/a> converted a full bath into a half bath. (The remaining space was used for a pantry). The new powder room was perfectly charming: a Brooklyn Toile on the walls designed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flavorpaper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beastie Boys&#8217; Mike D\u00a0for Flavor Paper<\/a> offset geometric floor tiles in the same color scheme.<\/p>\n<p>(3rd slide) Living in their home during the renovation, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alicia and Ed<\/a> realized their master bathroom needed a facelift. To stay within their budget, the couple kept the bathtub, flooring, and toilet and instead focused on key cosmetic details. Case in point? Their herringbone wallpaper by <a href=\"https:\/\/fermliving.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ferm Living<\/a> fit right in with the clean, calm vibe.<\/p>\n<h3>Wallpaper in bathrooms with floral patterns<\/h3>\n<div>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">(1st slide) Inspired by Instagram, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/sage-green-kitchen-remodel-in-kips-bay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allison<\/a> tried out a bold wallpaper to balance the neutral tile in her family\u2019s bathroom. It was also windowless so the pop of color was welcomed. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about the pattern so she purchased it as a peel-and-stick. It turns out it started to peel every time the shower was turned on. At that point, she loved the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yorkwallcoverings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wallpaper pattern<\/a> designed by Rifle Paper Co. and had the traditional paste version installed. Allison reported no issues with moisture!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>(2nd slide) \u201cPowder rooms should be wacky,\u201d insisted Sweeten renovator <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nazli<\/a>. She practiced what she preached by choosing a bright red-orange door that opens to a tiny but lushly <a href=\"https:\/\/cole-and-son.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cole &amp; Sons wallpapered<\/a> half bath that is located next to their dining room. Add brass fixtures and a Moroccan-inspired tile pattern to the floor, and the result is one-of-a-kind!<\/p>\n<p>(3rd slide) It took two years for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brooke and Sam<\/a> to find the right home for their family. And when they did, they had fun using wallpaper to give her daughter\u2019s bathroom personality. Thinking ahead, sophisticated gray and white tiles were the permanent elements that a future buyer would appreciate. However, the blue, pink, and yellow <a href=\"https:\/\/chasingpaper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">floral wallpaper from Chasing Paper<\/a> was the decorative item that brought the space to life.<\/p>\n<p>(4th slide) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/mid-century-mad-men-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alex and Tom<\/a> were initially planning to just tackle a kitchen reno, but ultimately decided the bathroom deserved a redo, too. They brought in details to align with the earthy scheme throughout the home with a large-scale leaf wallpaper from <a href=\"https:\/\/calicowallpaper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calico<\/a>, a walnut vanity, and vertically-laid black tiles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your bathroom or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Wallpaper in bathrooms with whimsical designs<\/h3>\n<div>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>(1st slide) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bellamy and Zack\u2019s<\/a> first-floor bath featured a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.target.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peel-and-stick wallcovering<\/a> called Speckle Dot. Luckily, the space was an easy update, thanks to its already functional layout. After a rip-and-replace of the fixtures, the couple tested out their DIY skills and added this jaunty black-and-white paper.<\/p>\n<p>(2nd slide) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/when-pros-design-their-family-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brett and Terri<\/a> stuck with a monochrome white-and-gray palette to make their bathroom feel bigger and brighter. To break up the floor-to-ceiling subway tile, Terri found a subtle aquatic-themed wallpaper from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyggeandwest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hygge and West<\/a>, Underwater World, that adds a whimsical touch to the guest bath.<\/p>\n<p>(3rd slide) Sweeten homeowners <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirsty and David<\/a> didn\u2019t want to sell the home they had lived in for 12 years. Their 1924 house would be renovated to live in for the long-term and gut renovated down to the framing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The couple opened up the interiors and modernized the exterior architecture. Design-wise,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>they sought a Scandinavian-modern look with Mid-Century and industrial touches. It extended into a powder room that was a small space. It received a compact sink and vanity.
