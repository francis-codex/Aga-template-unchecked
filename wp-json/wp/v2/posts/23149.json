We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The \u201cbefore\u201d layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old\u00a0en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg\" alt=\"Before and After Floorplans.001\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg\" alt=\"Before and After Floorplans.002\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a\u00a0bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen.\u00a0With the help of Sweeten, we <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/10047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted our project<\/a> and went with the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contractor<\/a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Manhattan renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing\u00a0the entrance from a\u00a0narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer\/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding\u00a0a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a\u00a0shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A\u00a0stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room\u2014formerly small storage space\u2014was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of design, we wished\u00a0to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">living room<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace\u00a0and the walls between\u00a0the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able\u00a0to build a third bedroom\/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23160 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23161 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-1-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23306 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Upper West Side renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-2-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23163 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-04\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23164 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-05\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our\u00a0en-suite <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bathrooms<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15\" width=\"723\" height=\"1084\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono\" title=\"Central Park West renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">office<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through.\u00a0<\/span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">garage<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end,\u00a0we decided to add extras along the way, which extended\u00a0the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor\u00a0did his best to complete these\u00a0while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented\u00a0and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>Thanks to Tim and Lindsay for sharing their gorgeous new home with us!\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Shaker cabinets: custom.
