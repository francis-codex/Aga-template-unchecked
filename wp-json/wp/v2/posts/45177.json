The value of homes increased by over seven percent in 2019, according to data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/city\/30756\/GA\/Atlanta\/housing-market\"><span class=\"s2\">Redfin<\/span><\/a>. It\u2019s one of those American city\u2019s that is revitalizing with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/atlanta\/news\/2020\/03\/30\/atlanta-population-soars-by-730-000-now.html\"><span class=\"s2\">fourth-fastest growth rate<\/span><\/a> in the nation. As a result, Atlanta homeowners are increasingly planning for home improvements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">If you\u2019re thinking of prepping your house for sale, Sweeten outlines the top home improvements for the Atlanta market to get the best price and sell quickly. <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sometimes renovations aren\u2019t always about what you want but what the homeowner who comes after you might want. A good idea is to take a look at the style of spec homes. \u201cThey try to use elements that have a large appeal,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6763#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Lonny<\/a>, who is based in Atlanta. When looking at the styles around Atlanta for your home improvements, sticking with what\u2019s popular is best for resale rather than involving your unique preferences. \u201cThere might be hundreds of choices for faucets, but 95 percent of people might go with three styles,\u201d said Lonny.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovation projects to consider:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Change out the front door<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First impressions endure when selling your home. \u201cIt is crucial that your entranceway is well kept,\u201d said Lonny. Sprucing up the front of your home could be as simple as adding a new front door. For one client, Lonny swapped out a plain door for a craftsman-style door along with matching shutters. \u201cIt really set the house apart,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. A fresh coat of paint\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Atlanta-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6767#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Justin<\/a> advises homeowners to think like makeup artists when accessing the front of their home ahead of a sale. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to attract buyers if the windows are fogged up and the paint is chipping,\u201d he said. Ensuring your house is clean and your paint fresh will go a long way in getting the best price, Justin said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Replace the garage door<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Along with your actual front door, replacing your garage door is a quick and easy fix to improve your home\u2019s value. A garage door replacement costs $3,663 on average for the Atlanta area, according to <em>Remodeling<\/em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/south-atlantic\/atlanta-ga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">report<\/span><\/a>. Your home\u2019s value is increased by more than 76 percent of that cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Invest in siding<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lonny often gets calls about siding replacement from homeowners who are planning to sell their home. New siding is a great investment, according to the 2020 Cost Vs Value <span class=\"s2\">report<\/span> for Atlanta. A project that installs fiber-cement siding costs an average of $17,000. Over $13,000 or 78 percent of the project\u2019s cost is returned to you in the value that it adds to the home. That\u2019s one of the highest returns on investment of any renovation project, according to the report.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">5. Basement as living space<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The basement is the first thing Justin looks at if a client is planning to resell their home. An unfinished basement has the potential to significantly <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase the square footage of your home<\/a>. \u201cFinishing your basement is going to yield the largest return on your investment,\u201d said Justin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other alterations, such as a kitchen or bathroom remodel, are helpful, but they don\u2019t add to the size of your home like a basement can. The square footage of your home and its price per square foot will feature prominently in your home\u2019s sale listing. Depending on how many floors you have, a finished basement could almost double that square foot measurement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A full basement renovation that includes budget-friendly floors, paint, lighting, and a half bath can start at $20,000. &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">On the conservative side for finishes, a turn-key basement will cost around $50-65 per square foot to finish out,&#8221; said Justin. &#8220;This includes a small kitchen area and basement bathroom if all the rough-in plumbing is already installed.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ccording to the Cost Vs Value <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2017\/south-atlantic\/atlanta-ga\/\">report<\/a>, t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he average cost of a basement remodel in Atlanta was $70,000<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This increases a home\u2019s value by $46,000 or more than 65 percent of the renovation\u2019s cost, the report found.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. The bathroom adds value<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Giving your bathroom a makeover is an easy route to a higher house price. Recently, a real estate agent contacted Lonny with a house about to go on the market. To increase its value ahead of the sale, Lonny completed a modified gut renovation in the bathroom. \u201cThis was something that was needed because it was dated from the 1980s,\u201d said Lonny. The customer had everything replaced except the cabinetry. The budget was about $20,000. A bathroom remodel in this budget range adds almost $13,000 \u201465 percent of the budget\u2014 to your home\u2019s value, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class=\"s2\">report<\/span> for Atlanta.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you don\u2019t have the time for a major remodel, then simple superficial changes might be a better option. This could mean swapping outdated fixtures like faucets for something more modern, said Lonny. A new countertop on your vanity could also spruce up your bathroom with minimum effort.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">7. A streamlined kitchen refresh<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchens are the gathering place, a focal point for any home. A kitchen could also make or break your home\u2019s value, according to Justin. Rather than doing a full renovation that involves the costly exercise of changing a layout, stick to a scaled-back renovation. \u201cA new countertop, backsplash, and faucet can go along way,\u201d said Lonny. \u201cIf there\u2019s the budget for it then I also suggest lighting and flooring.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cabinets, especially if they are custom-built, can take up a huge chunk of a budget. For a renovation that is geared towards increasing value, Lonny advised keeping cabinets as is. That way the budget and timeline can be streamlined.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A minor kitchen remodel with a budget of $23,000 has a high return on investment of 73 percent, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/south-atlantic\/atlanta-ga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">report<\/span><\/a>. A minor kitchen remodel in this instance involves replacing only the front of your cabinets, sink, faucet and countertops while adding an energy-efficient cooktop, oven, and refrigerator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Give your home a fresh and neutral slate. Curb appeal gets the potential buyer to enter the door. A conservative palette inside allows them to more easily see how they can make the home their own. Take these home improvement ideas into consideration and be one step closer to closing the deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/2020-sweeten-guide-costs-to-remodel-in-atlanta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">renovation cost guide for Atlanta<\/a> for purchasing a new home or updating an existing one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
