The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget for\u00a0the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23092 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23098 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23099 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-04\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23100 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-09\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tom Stuart<\/span>\u00a0(who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, Sam\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/10514\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted the project<\/a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23104 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23101 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-06\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23103 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-08\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23102 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-07\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneath\u2014a brave choice for a family bathroom!\u2014Sam reports that they\u2019ve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the rest of the apartment, the couple\u2019s Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Sean\u2019s preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/skim-coating-in-5-homes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skim-coated<\/a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had done\u2014and are now in the process of doing\u2014was to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full\" title=\"Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: \u201cGo to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors weren\u2019t working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.\u201d The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thanks to Sam, Sean, Ellie, Ernie, and baby Alice, for sharing your home!
