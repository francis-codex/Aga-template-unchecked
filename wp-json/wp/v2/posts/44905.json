It\u2019s not without its twists and turns with something unexpected (the good and the bad). With safety and function in mind, this is the right time to make your home the way you want it. It\u2019s good planning to have an idea of where hidden renovation costs may come up &#8211; from outdated wiring to soil stability.<\/p>\n<p>These unseen bumps can increase the cost of your project and the time it takes to finish. Preparation can help with the hurdles. Atlanta general contractors from <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, tell us what hidden renovation costs in Atlanta to watch for.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation cost: Upgrading electrical and plumbing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There was a time for all cities where building renovations and new construction went unregulated. That meant no permits, no code of ethics, no insurance and no need to follow building codes. \u201cPeople would hire someone solely based on price,\u201d explains <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6745#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Kimberly<\/a> on how Atlanta construction once worked. A licensed contractor could do a job at a certain cost, \u201cbut an uncle\u2019s friend can do it for $30.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Atlanta didn\u2019t really button this all up tightly until about two decades ago. \u201cBefore that, there wasn\u2019t much to hold a contractor\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d Kimberly said. That means plenty of surprises when walls, floors, and ceilings of older homes open up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A project Kimberly had worked on in an upscale neighborhood had live wires in the ceiling that connected to nothing. \u201cIt literally could have set the house on fire,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">These unforeseen problems can add to the cost of the project as well as the timeline. In another project, Kimberly\u2019s client wanted an open plan living room and kitchen. Walls were removed. Once the demo started, the team discovered a drain stack inside one of the walls. The plumbing rerouted to add a week to the project\u2019s timeline and about $4,000 to the cost. But these electrical and plumbing updates \u201cwill last forever until the next remodel,\u201d she said. \u201c<\/span><span class=\"s2\">Each update has to follow the most current code at that time.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation cost: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Abating lead and asbestos\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s safe to assume that any home built before 1978 in Atlanta will have lead paint and asbestos. That\u2019s unless the poisonous materials were removed at some stage. The US banned lead paint in 1978. It wasn\u2019t until the late 1980s that building materials could no longer contain asbestos. The material is now federally regulated in Atlanta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Before beginning a project on an older home, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6670#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Dexter<\/a>, who is based in Atlanta, always tests for both of these substances. Handheld x-ray devices detect lead paint even if it is buried under layers of safe paint. Lead dust can also show up in swab tests that take a few days to process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Asbestos can be found in paint, flooring, pipes, insulation, fireproof materials, and wiring. It can show up in dust samples. To isolate where the asbestos is located, samples of the materials previously mentioned are sent to a lab. Contractors need a specific license to test for either lead or asbestos. Some contractors, like Dexter, are licensed to do a small amount of lead testing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What if lead or asbestos is found in your home? Either just the area you are disturbing (if it\u2019s a smaller project) or your entire home will need to be abated. A licensed company should do the abatement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen homes abated and it took two to three weeks,\u201d said Dexter. This can increase your costs by a few thousand dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere is also an option to leave the asbestos where it\u2019s found and left undisturbed,\u201d he said. Despite the time delay and extra costs, \u201cclients have a peace of mind knowing this has been abated properly,\u201d said Dexter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation cost: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Soil conditions in Atlanta<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation costs start to show themselves when your project\u00a0messes with Atlanta&#8217;s waterways, ridges, soils, and rock beds.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> Setting foundations in soil too soft can mean big issues later on as your deck or extension settles and shifts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In order to complete an outdoor deck for a client, Kimberly drilled down triple the distance that was in the initial plan. At six feet, \u201cthe soil was gray indicating there was water there,\u201d she said. The crew drilled down to 18 feet before they found soil suitable for the deck\u2019s foundation. \u201cIt was an additional $12,000,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have the space, consider that building an outdoor deck increases your living square footage. A typical wood deck addition will return 63% of your investment, and a 73% return on investment for composite material, according to Remodeling\u2019s Cost vs Value 2020 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/south-atlantic\/atlanta-ga\/\"><span class=\"s3\">report<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation cost: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Tree removal permits in Atlanta<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the City of Atlanta, removal of any tree with a trunk larger than 6\u201d in diameter for hardwoods and 12\u201d in diameter for pine requires <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlantaga.gov\/government\/departments\/city-planning\/office-of-buildings\/arborist-division\"><span class=\"s3\">approval<\/span><\/a>. An arborist from the city will inspect the tree and then issue a permit if it passes. It is tightly regulated to minimize the loss of a mature tree canopy. \u201cAtlanta was a forest before it was a city,\u201d said Sweeten expert Kimberly. \u201cThey are trying to keep clean air quality.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If trees need to be removed, a well-thought-out site plan should show the trees and house and how its presence affects the future design. An explanation for why it needs to be removed is helpful. \u201cThere are a variety of permits issued by the City of Atlanta for tree removal,\u201d said Kimberly, including it\u2019s dead, diseased, or in a hazardous location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The fee to remove a tree starts at $130. This money goes into the city\u2019s Tree Trust Fund, which plants new trees and maintains existing ones. If your application to remove a tree for a renovation is denied, the plans will need to be modified. She suggests to apply for the tree removal permit first, otherwise your contractor will apply for it along with the building permit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hidden renovation cost: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Permits in Atlanta<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Atlanta is <a href=\"https:\/\/patch.com\/georgia\/atlanta\/atlanta-named-8th-fastest-growing-large-city-america-study\"><span class=\"s3\">ranked 8th <\/span><\/a>in the United States for its growth rate amongst other large cities. That means a lot of new construction and renovations on existing homes as new owners move in. With so many permit applications for the Atlanta buildings department to process, the approvals can be unpredictable coming in as little as one day or 30 days for the same permit, according to Kimberly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt puts a damper on the timeline for homeowner and contractor,\u201d she said. Having a design-build firm, general contractor, or an architect come early on in the process helps ensure complete documentation is ready for the permit application process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Whatever complexities lay ahead in a renovation, understanding and preparing for hidden renovation costs common to Atlanta is a good starting point.
