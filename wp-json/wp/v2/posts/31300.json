The housing lottery, that is! The prize: a one-bedroom apartment with a terrace in one of New York City\u2019s famed Mitchell-Lama apartments near Manhattan&#8217;s South Street Seaport. (As an affordable housing program started in the mid 20th century, Mitchell-Lama housing ensures that many New Yorkers are able to remain in the city on moderate to middle incomes.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At first, Saul and his now wife, Kate,\u00a0lived in the apartment. When\u00a0the couple left New York, Saul\u2019s brother moved into the apartment with his family. Initially, they didn\u2019t do much to the space,\u00a0making only cosmetic improvements, updating the carpets, adding some window blinds, and changing out some bath fixtures. Fast forward a decade and the apartment had seen a lot of wear and tear.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before6.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31304 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before6-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31303 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before5-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31306 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31305 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Kate and Saul discovered last year that they would be returning to New York for their jobs\u2014Saul works for a political consulting firm and Kate in international development\u2014they realized that a full renovation was in order before they could live in the apartment again. Saul\u2019s brother, who now has two kids, had long outgrown the space. The kitchen cabinets were falling off their hinges, and the carpets and blinds had not aged well. The bathroom also needed a thorough update. The floors and walls needed to be refreshed. They were also thinking ahead to the eventual resale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the period since Saul and his brother obtained the apartment, the building\u2019s residents had voted to privatize the corporation. Existing residents were given the option of putting in some additional funding in order to buy into the now market-rate, privatized co-op building. This meant that homeowners would eventually be able to sell the apartment on the open market, and when they went to do that, it would be important to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/renovating-your-home-for-resale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">renovation that could facilitate resale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31307 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31301 size-chrono\" title=\"gray-dining-space-natural-floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"gray dining space in a natural wood flooring and a dining table with man working after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31308 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"sliding door\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath15-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With all of this in mind, Kate and Saul <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/23672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted their project on Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, at the suggestion of a co-worker after they experienced a false start with another contractor who did not understand how to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">navigate co-op board approvals<\/a>.

Kate loves color and pattern and had wanted to\u00a0incorporate a lot of both, but after talking it through with their contractor, and with resale in mind, she\u00a0decided that color could be added in less permanent ways. Changing the plumbing locations or adding too much electrical weight to the apartment weren&#8217;t options, given its age and their construction timeline. However, good visual flow from room to room was important, and more than anything, the couple wanted a simple, comfortable space for friends and family to hang out.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31310 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31344 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31313 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"wood-vinyl-floor-white-kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif\" alt=\"natural wood vinyl floor with white kitchen cabinets and knobs and silver oven after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As they began, a few hiccups slowed their progress. The building&#8217;s strict requirements meant jumping through multiple hoops for approval, which took months, but their contractor was key in getting them through this process. Next, as they embarked on demolition, workers uncovered asbestos in the floor tiles of the living room, which then had to undergo a full remediation that took two months. The Sweeten contractor addressed these issues as quickly as possible and got them back on track.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31314 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31343 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31316 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"white-kitchen-cabinets-gray-knob\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif\" alt=\"white kitchen cabinets with gray knob and silver appliance along with gray backsplash after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In October 2017, the couple moved back to New York and into the apartment. The renovation was not quite done: they didn\u2019t have a door on the bathroom and the kitchen was not yet finished. Their only working sink was in the bathroom. But the contractor worked to\u00a0complete the kitchen 10 days after they moved back in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The wait was well worth it: Kate loves the look of the custom cabinets and was thrilled with the useful storage solutions. They not only have a built-in silverware drawer, but also a corner Lazy Susan and a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/spice-rack-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pull-out spice rack<\/a>! The contractor made some minor adjustments to the footprint of the kitchen, removing an old broom closet opposite the refrigerator to make room for a new dishwasher. The other appliances, swapped out for new models, remained in the same spots as their predecessors.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31322 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before10-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31317 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath08-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation, Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath11.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31318 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"white-gray-bathroom-vanity-mirror\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath11.gif\" alt=\"white and gray bathroom with long vanity mirror and brushed nickel faucet after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the bathroom, a gray vanity is set against white subway tile with black accent tiles and a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/10-bathroom-floor-tiles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">patterned floor<\/a>. The look is simple but very New York, befitting a downtown apartment. In the rest of the apartment, a light-colored hardwood replaced gray carpeting and subtle colors provide a calming backdrop for an escape from the city streets. All of the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/closet-renovation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closets<\/a> received makeovers, courtesy of the Sweeten contractor\u2019s father, who happened to be a millworker and walked through the apartment with Kate to sketch out her vision of how the closets could be made more practical.\u00a0Last but not least, they removed the popcorn ceiling and applied three coats of skim coating and painting. The walls also received basic sanding prior to painting. \u201cThe ceiling was really a miraculous transformation,\u201d Kate reports. \u201cIt totally changed the look of the apartment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking back on the process, Kate shares that she had no experience with design and no background in home improvement, so she was not at all prepared for the work and time it required on a daily basis. She also realized that, as a homeowner, you need to be prepared to explain exactly what you want so that the contractor and his team can execute it: \u201cThey aren\u2019t mind-readers!\u201d She\u00a0met with them each day during the construction to discuss options and make decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that the interior of the apartment is done, they are ready to turn their attention to their coveted outdoor terrace in the city! When that time comes, Sweeten is ready to help them &#8220;sweeten&#8221; their outdoors, too.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Kate and Saul, for sharing your special New York City\u00a0homecoming story with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Heritage Mills Vintage Hickory engineered flooring in natural: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/p\/Heritage-Mill-Vintage-Hickory-Natural-3-8-in-x-4-3-4-in-Wide-x-Random-Length-Engineered-Click-Hardwood-Flooring-33-sq-ft-case-PF9710\/206126497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Depot<\/a>.
