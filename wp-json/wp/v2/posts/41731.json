From the South Shore to the North Fork, we have the numbers you\u2019ll need to plan your renovation&#8217;s budget. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> breaks down the costs on four major remodeling cost categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although \u201cLong Island\u201d is technically a region that is home to four New York counties, including Kings County (better known as Brooklyn!) and Queens, this cost guide focuses on the portion of the island that is colloquially known as Long Island, which is primarily Nassau and Suffolk counties. This guide does not include the Hamptons, which is a world of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">its own with renovation prices<\/a> to match.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of typical starting costs that include labor and materials compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling<\/em>\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost vs. Value report<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Full-home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100<\/strong> per square foot (psf) with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+<\/strong> psf<\/li>\r\n<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$20,000\u2014$30,000<\/strong> (under 100 square feet)<\/li>\r\n<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000<\/strong>\u00a0(for 200 square feet)<\/li>\r\n<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$75,000+<\/strong> (for 200 square feet)<\/li>\r\n<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$15,000\u2014$20,000<\/strong> (35 to 40 square feet)<\/li>\r\n<li>Mid-grade bath remodel: <strong>$21,000\u2014$40,000<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000+<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<li>Basement remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Keep in mind while it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.<\/p>\r\n<h3>What does a Long Island home remodel cost per square foot?<\/h3>\r\n<p>Long Island\u2019s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons means that the same regional averages apply. However, real estate prices in Long Island are lower than their neighbors on both sides, and this affects renovation costs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most full-home Sweeten renovations in villages including Great Neck, New Hyde Park, and Bellport generally start at <strong>$100<\/strong> psf.<span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4914#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Aaron<\/a> estimates that cosmetic facelifts for dry rooms can be <strong>$30<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$70<\/strong> psf <\/span><span style=\"color: #333333;\">for his projects, while\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #333333;\">wet rooms (rooms that are connected to a water supply, i.e., bathrooms or kitchens) typically start at <strong>$375<\/strong>\u00a0per square feet. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">In Sweeten&#8217;s experience, bathrooms in Long Island are typically larger than 5&#8217;x8&#8242; and can measure 8&#8243;x7&#8242; or 9&#8243;x7&#8242;. High-end (full custom, luxury materials) wet room renovations can cost well over <strong>$700<\/strong> per square foot. This cost range includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction\u2014the whole project.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h5>Fewer hurdles in Long Island<\/h5>\r\n<p>Since most residential renovations in Long Island are for single-family, fully detached houses, the logistics of renovation are more straightforward. Contractors won&#8217;t need to worry about where to park a car or have limits on the permitted construction hours. (Even if there are city ordinances that limit noise, those are much longer than the working hours typically permitted by an NYC co-op.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, apartment buildings, whether condo or co-op, typically require contractors to ensure cleanliness in the hallways. When workers must spend the beginning and end of the workday prepping and cleaning the halls, this can take up precious time! These factors, which don\u2019t impact most Long Island houses, can result in more affordable prices for those renovators.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten contractor Aaron tells us that, since construction was permitted to restart after the shutdown, clients are itching to get back to their renovations. The most common renovations he\u2019s seeing are additions, dormers, kitchens, baths, pool pavers, and decks.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46398\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/CTA-Find-NY-GCs.png\" alt=\"Find New York General Contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/CTA-Find-NY-GCs.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/CTA-Find-NY-GCs-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3>Costs for a Long Island kitchen renovation<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can cost between <strong>$20,000\u2014$30,000<\/strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. This typically means making use of engineered flooring, off-the-shelf cabinets, and an economical tile or butcher block for countertops. It also includes swapping out old appliances for energy-efficient models.<\/li>\r\n<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$30,000<\/strong>. <em>Remodeling<\/em>\u2019s Cost vs. Value Report shows that a mid-grade, major kitchen renovation of a 200-square-foot space will run about <strong>$69,910<\/strong>\u00a0based on averages for the Middle Atlantic region (as opposed to <strong>$84,484<\/strong> for New York City). This range covers updating 30 linear feet of semi-custom wood cabinets, an island, new countertops, a double-tub stainless steel sink, energy-efficient range, vented hood, built-in microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and custom lighting. This comes to about <strong>$350<\/strong>\u00a0psf.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5543#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Vita<\/a>, \u201cKitchens on Long Island typically need a full gut in order to upgrade electrical, plumbing, insulation, and correcting for settling of the foundation.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>High-end kitchen: Expect the budget to start at <strong>$75,000<\/strong>. The same Cost vs. Value report puts a luxury kitchen renovation around <strong>$137,700<\/strong> for the region. This will get you top-of-the-line custom cabinets with interior accessories, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, commercial-grade cooktop and hood, wall oven, built-in microwave, with designer faucets and a water filtration system. This budget also includes custom lighting, including under-cabinet lights, and wood flooring throughout. Broken down to price per square foot, this comes in at <strong>$689<\/strong> psf.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48192 mb-48\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Long-Island-RemodelingCosts-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Long-Island-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Long-Island-RemodelingCosts--300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Long-Island-RemodelingCosts--600x426.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Costs for a Long Island bathroom renovation<\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <strong>$15,000<\/strong> to <strong>$20,000<\/strong> for a 5\u2019 x 8\u2019 space with budget-friendly finishes. Sweeten contractor Vita said, \u201cBathroom remodels often need the same treatment as kitchens, and require a full overhaul of plumbing, electrical supplies, insulation, exhaust ductwork as well as floor and wall straightening. Our base price for a typically-sized, 35-square-foot bathroom renovation starts at <strong>$22,158<\/strong>, with material and subcontractor allowances.\u201d<\/li>\r\n<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom remodel for a 35-square-foot area will cost anywhere from <strong>$21,000<\/strong> to <strong>$40,000<\/strong>. The Cost vs. Value report provides an average of <strong>$22,158<\/strong> for the Middle Atlantic region. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub.<\/li>\r\n<li>High-end bathroom: Sweeten contractors report high-end renovations range starts at <strong>$40,000<\/strong> and goes up at luxury price points. The same report puts a high-end renovation at <strong>$69,188<\/strong> for the region. This is based on the expansion of a 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, within the existing home&#8217;s footprint. A high-end renovation at this price point includes radiant floors, all new ductwork, custom cabinetry, separate shower, and freestanding tub, as well as custom lighting.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3>Costs for a Long Island basement renovation<\/h3>\r\n<p>Based on Sweeten&#8217;s numbers, the average basement conversion in Long Island comes in at <strong>$117<\/strong> psf. For a budget, we&#8217;ve seen projects start at <strong>$25,000<\/strong> and\u00a0include a bathroom, shower, and laminate flooring. On the high end, a project costing <strong>$75,000<\/strong> would include a 5\u2019 x 8\u2019 bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring in 20\u2019 x 30\u2019 space.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is in line with what is reported by Sweeten contractors. For example, Sweeten contractor Vita shares that Long Island basements generally run about <strong>$35,000<\/strong> for a budget, <strong>$60,000<\/strong> for a mid-grade renovation, and more than <strong>$60,000<\/strong> for a high-end project.<\/p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that the existing condition of the space will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper so the ceiling appears higher, and the walls could require underpinning. Sometimes electricity and plumbing need to be installed, especially if there is no existing bathroom and that\u2019s a crucial part of your plans. Installation and waterproofing can also be a significant cost if needed.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Costs for permits<\/h3>\r\n<p>In Long Island, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. Towns throughout the island all levy different fees. In Suffolk County, for renovations up to <strong>$50,000<\/strong>, the permit fee is <strong>$250<\/strong>, and <strong>$500<\/strong> for renovations up to <strong>$100,000<\/strong>. For projects above <strong>$250,000<\/strong>, contractor Aaron estimates the cost is 15%\u00a0 per <strong>$1,000<\/strong> for the permit. Plumbing and electrical permits both start at <strong>$50<\/strong>. For the full list, you can consult this fee schedule.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hopefully, these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget.
