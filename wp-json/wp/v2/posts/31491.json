They found a 1,090-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo on a quiet, pedestrian-friendly street in a well-maintained high-rise built in the &#8217;60s.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chong said that for years she read \u201cwith envy the various home blogs and design sites, one of which was Sweeten.\u201d She daydreamed about having her \u201cown home and a kitchen with ample counter space and height-appropriate storage.\u201d She wondered if she would forever store pots and pans in the oven and have to keep a step stool in the kitchen to reach the upper cabinet shelves.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">As soon as they closed on their condo, Chong said, \u201cI posted our condo renovation project to Sweeten and was matched with our contractor. <\/span>From our first meeting, we were on the same page as to how to bring the unit out of the \u201960s and \u201980s. We loved his energy and creativity, and also felt assured that Sweeten had done the legwork for us in checking his credentials and reviews of past work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To maximize planning for their New Jersey condo renovation, they came to the first meeting with lots of ideas. Their contractor, Chong said, \u201callowed us to make the design decisions while they focused on the nuts and bolts of how to make it all happen. Aesthetically, I favored simple lines with a touch of an industrial feel, and Adam liked warm, traditional finishes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<h3>Kitchen drawers make the difference<\/h3>\n<p>The first item on their New Jersey condo renovation checklist was to slightly enlarge the footprint of the kitchen. At about 8\u2019x8\u2019, it was not very large, and a floor-to-ceiling pantry blocked natural light from the living room. In the small footprint, a standard-depth refrigerator made access to the pantry awkward, and there was limited counter space.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Adam will say out of the blue, \u2018I love our place.\u2019 And I really do, too.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>They opted to tear down the pantry and put in a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">peninsula, adding about a foot of space<\/a> along its length. The peninsula addition forced a change to the kitchen\u2019s entry, so they cut a portion of a hallway wall and redirected some electrical lines and a light switch. Drawers in the peninsula solved storage issues from the loss of the pantry. As a result, they gained easy access to frequently used items, storage for pots and pans, and \u201cmost importantly, little use for a step stool,\u201d Chong said.<\/p>\n<p>There was a challenge to the floor plan since the kitchen wasn\u2019t level with the rest of the space; the contractor had to do some research so he could raise the kitchen floor. \u201cHe did a great job of making it seamless without the need for any transition pieces,\u201d Chong said.<\/p>\n<h3>Updating the bathrooms<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two bathrooms were easier in terms of design, but the plumbing and electrical changes were more extensive behind the walls. Once the updates were made, the bathrooms came along quickly. The guest bathroom was set in a traditional style, while the master bath would be a little more modern. \u201cWe love the minimalist handles and how the handles and the glass doors together make the bathrooms look larger,\u201d Chong said.<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the rest of the apartment, some of the walls were repaired and plastered with new baseboards and fresh coats of paint were applied. They also removed all of the old carpets and discovered parquet floors. \u201cWe liked the original walnut color, so our Sweeten contractor simply screened (removed the old finish without sanding) and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/repair-protect-wood-floors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coated the floors<\/a> with a satin finish,\u201d Chong said.<\/p>\n<h3>Working with their Sweeten contractor<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their New Jersey condo renovation took about four months from the day they signed a contract with their Sweeten contractor to the date of final inspection. \u201cConsidering how he was limited to the work hours and days set by my building\u2019s management, he kept to a good pace,\u201d Chong said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While there were no major surprises or roadblocks, she and Adam moved into the apartment about halfway through the renovation. During their overlap, Chong said, \u201cOur contractor, ever the gentleman, was very accommodating and respectful of our privacy and comfort.\u201d Now, after a few months since the renovation\u2019s completion, \u201cAdam will say out of the blue, \u2018I love our place.\u2019 And I really do, too.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Shopping Guide<\/h4>\n<p>KITCHEN: Oxford Linen Ice porcelain tile floor tiles, #100235829: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flooranddecor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Floor and D\u00e9cor<\/a>.
