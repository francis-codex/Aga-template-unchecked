It started with a part-time job while I was in high school working for a friend of the family who had a pretty big construction company. I have some family background in the industry\u00a0but\u00a0never gave it any thought. I had always thought of myself as a finance guy but realized\u00a0I just loved speaking and working with people. I really liked engaging new clients, hearing about their prospective projects, and learning what they were looking to do\u2014and it kind of snowballed from there. Being on jobs and seeing what you uncover during the work, how you fix it\u00a0and seeing the end result is all really exciting.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-sheets-value=\"[null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\\n&quot;]\" data-sheets-userformat=\"[null,null,17153,[null,0],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1]\">What do you love most about construction?<\/span><\/strong><span data-sheets-value=\"[null,2,&quot;What do you love most about construction?\\n&quot;]\" data-sheets-userformat=\"[null,null,17153,[null,0],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1]\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the things I really love is seeing the progression. I love how we\u00a0take something and have the ability to completely change it; it\u2019s so cool. Seeing a job from start to finish is a lot of fun. My favorite part of the creative side is when we\u2019re going through the planning and the &#8220;teasing out ideas&#8221; phase with our clients\u2014I really enjoy that. Of course, it\u2019s fun to meet new people as well; we\u2019re dealing with different personalities, styles, and properties on a daily basis. There\u2019s always something new around the corner. Needless to say, my job never gets boring!<\/p>\n<p><strong><span data-sheets-value=\"[null,2,&quot;What is your ideal client?&quot;]\" data-sheets-userformat=\"[null,null,17153,[null,0],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,null,1]\">Who is your ideal client?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My ideal client is someone who doesn\u2019t want to be their own general contractor and who can really trust and confide in us for our opinion. This way, we can truly have a collaborative effort in creating a great space for them. Most of our clients are professionals\u00a0who don&#8217;t have the time to do everything and appreciate the high level of service we provide.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33260 size-chrono\" title=\"How to find a general contractor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-101-723x143.jpg\" alt=\"general contractor\" width=\"723\" height=\"143\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-101-723x143.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-101-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-101-600x119.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-101.jpg 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A\u00a0lot of people think that their project is going to be very quick, be able to start the very next day, and be inexpensive, because it\u2019s just a small kitchen or just a small bathroom\u2014they just saw an entire renovation on a television show, which was really weeks or months of work in just 30 minutes! Budgets and timelines! Good things take some time, right? You need to have a professional who has all the proper credentials, certifications, licenses, insurances and really gets the process. Most importantly, you need someone you can gel with. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get the\u00a0right outcome. For a lot of people we speak to, we need to be clear that there is almost always a wait to start a project. We are usually booked out several months in advance to begin physical work, although we begin working behind-the-scenes right away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the biggest challenges for us is the number of building management companies and how they\u00a0operate. They\u00a0all have different turnaround times which can affect a project&#8217;s timeline and can be hard to forecast.\u00a0Each individual building has\u00a0its own quirks as well. We work through these things, but it can be challenging at times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Favorite New York City\u00a0restaurant?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Joe\u2019s Shanghai is an all-time favorite of mine in New York City. Ultimate comfort food.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Favorite New York City building?<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<p>The Freedom Tower. It has a special meaning to me and many other New Yorkers.
