The floor plan and square footage suit your needs and the price is right. What else do you need to know?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One huge factor that may even impact securing a mortgage is the cost of monthly fees associated with a Homeowners Association. Here, Sweeten outlines the important elements to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">before you purchase<\/a> an HOA property.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is an HOA?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">High-rise ownership means sharing in the maintenance of common areas and all those amenities you love\u2014swimming pool, green space, exercise rooms, etc. Whether it\u2019s a condo, co-op, or townhome that\u2019s part of a complex, all homeowners who buy in become members of their building\u2019s Homeowners Association.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a board, typically made up of 5 to 15 residents elected by owners, to govern the rules and regulations (specifically, CC &amp; R or Covenants, or Conditions and Restrictions), usually for a two-year term. This group of directors meets annually, with some meetings throughout the year, open to homeowners except for voting. The board assesses budgets, services, any business that involves day-to-day operations, and making sure that established rules and regulations are met.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The goal of an overall yearly plan is to decide how much monthly HOA fees (aka assessments) need to be in order to cover expenses.\u00a0 Part of the expense is a property management fee as well as salaries for on-site personnel, like a building manager, assistant, engineer, and cleaning crew. The HOA also is a sounding board for issues homeowners may have, either in the building or surrounding neighborhoods.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>HOA fees, explained<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fees range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. This depends on the age and size of the building (how many units), amenities and total expenditures, prorated according to the size of the apartments\u2014studio, one, two or three or more bedrooms, with the largest at the top end of the sliding scale. Also factored in are particular unit features like larger balconies, private penthouse roof decks, and parking spaces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBy law, I\u2019m required to list capital expenditures for the next two years,\u201d says one condo manager in Chicago\u2019s South Loop. That requires keeping tabs of utility prices and expected hikes as well as phone and cable charges, with periodic negotiating\u2014in one case, that saved almost $100,000 and significantly upped the building\u2019s internet speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While fees sometimes stay static, they usually rise yearly, sometimes up to 4 percent or more. Also, unexpected city hikes, such as an 8 percent water increase, are difficult to anticipate. Your HOA fee is a constant, just like property taxes. Your home may be foreclosed by the association, if you don\u2019t pay..<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do HOA fees cover?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HOA fees generally are part of monthly assessments, which basically address what it costs to maintain common areas. Here is what they may cover depending on your building\u2019s property:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Vacuuming and cleaning in lobbies, hallways, and mailrooms, and general building maintenance.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trash pick-up (by the city or private companies).<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">For buildings with pools, there\u2019s cleaning and maintenance.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">For green areas, there may be landscaping contractors who keep an eye on planters so they don\u2019t leak, water plants (either by hand or with an irrigation system), and weed on a regular basis.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Garages are power washed, usually at least twice a year, to maintain the membrane of the concrete floor, limiting deterioration.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Property management fee and on-staff salaries, as well as insurance and a reserve account.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Before you buy, what you need to know about HOAs<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if everything seems perfect about your prospective home, it\u2019s crucial to check out the financial health of the building, just as you might examine all the mechanicals and exterior components of a single-family home. Meet the management and ask questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a good idea to consult with a real estate lawyer (even better, one who specializes in HOAs) to take a look at the history of assessments over the course of the last 5 to 10 years. How many raises have there been, and what is the percentage of those raises? Check for any red flags. One could be an unusual number of apartments for sale at a given time. Or special assessments\u2014what they were for, how much they were. Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ask how much capital is in reserves. This is a critical point. Some associations will set aside at least $50,000 each year for the what-ifs. Owners obviously don\u2019t want to see assessments rise. \u201cBut,\u201d says one manager, \u201cwhat if the gas contract goes up a lot? What kind of electricity contract has been negotiated?\u00a0 What if union or non-union paying health benefits rise? It has to be run like a business,\u201d with an eye on the bottom line and ever-changing rates, just like the cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there\u2019s a major breakdown\u2014a roof, a boiler, an elevator issue, and there\u2019s not enough in reserves, you\u2019ll get hit up with a special assessment. Some condos hire attorneys or specialists to lobby for lowering property taxes. That might translate to a one-time monthly upcharge, like $75. But a major issue, like a burst pipe or a mechanical issue with an elevator, can mean big bucks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is it sustainable?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You may also have concerns about sustainability, energy-saving, and using eco-friendly materials. Many buildings are switching to longer-lasting LEDs, which will cut down on costs. Some buildings use enzyme and plant-based cleaning products, organic materials for flower and community herb gardens, and stay away from harsh chemical treatments for weeds. Pet-friendly buildings also are mindful of keeping snow off of sidewalks with salt that doesn\u2019t harm paws.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do you work with an HOA?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you want to rent out your unit: <\/b>This<b> <\/b>really falls under rules and regulations and some buildings have taken a stricter stance against rentals, because of Airbnb. Many now require long-term contracts with a minimum of six months, and the prospective renters need to be thoroughly vetted, with references and credit histories. Liability is a serious issue.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>While remodeling: <\/b>So, about that kitchen? The cabinets and countertops really aren\u2019t your style. The appliances need updating, and so do the sink and faucet.<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even if you had a contractor ready to start tomorrow, that probably can\u2019t happen. Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, you need the approval of the HOA. That means you need a written game plan, detailing everything that is proposed. Spell out the kinds of cabinetry you\u2019ll use, appliances, floor covering, backsplash and counter material, electrical and plumbing plans. In many instances, you can\u2019t change the site of plumbing. There are some restrictions on materials. With flooring, there might be sound considerations (with a baffling subfloor for tile, for example), so you need to ask. Familiarize yourself with rules and regs before you hire an architect or contractor.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hire a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">licensed general contractor<\/a>. A general contractor will have licensed and insured plumbers, electricians on board, tile and counter installers (or people they work with), plus painters, so you can source all through one person. The contractor needs proof of licensing, bonding and insurance, and generally needs to add your condo building address to that insurance. The reason for this is if something goes south in a major way, not only will you be sued, but so will the building for not doing due diligence.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once the board reviews your proposal and sees no red flags, you\u2019ll be given approval. This may take some time. Obviously, you need to coordinate time for work, respecting other homeowners by sticking to daytime work, limiting noise as much as possible. Also, freight elevators must be reserved in advance for deliveries of larger items like appliances and cabinetry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The bottom line with HOAs<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Obviously, HOA fees can hugely impact your bottom line, as you need to factor in assessments along with mortgage payments, utilities you are responsible for (electrical, phone\/cable, for example), your own property insurance, as well as property taxes. With the right research and proper planning, you can be on your way to finding the right home with a sound Homeowners Association to work with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>How long does an apartment renovation take? <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Find out here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
