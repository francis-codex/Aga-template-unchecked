Walking into their son\u2019s room, Carol and her husband found him sitting in one corner of his bed, staring at a steady drip on the other end. (That was a low point.)<\/p>\n<p>They had already undergone a Sweeten kitchen renovation in<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/carols-carroll-street-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> their previous home<\/a>, and while it was a wonderful experience, they did not think they\u2019d be signing up for another one so soon. Luckily, the leak proved to be an opportunity not just to make the necessary repairs, but to improve the space in small ways that worked for their family, too.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>Their first order of business required finding and fixing the source of the leak, and repairing the exterior. Given that it was still wintery, the exterior repairs could not be completed until early summer. Once a team of roofers completed the task, Carol turned her attention to the interior renovation. She <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/29242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted her project <\/a>to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3938#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hired this contractor<\/a> based on his excellent reviews by previous Sweeten clients.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The contractor fashioned a custom shoe cabinet to fit in a nook by the door, and a floating shelf above.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The contractor opened up the walls to make sure that there wasn\u2019t any mold lurking inside. Luckily, there was no sign of any growth. The Sweeten contractor got to work repairing the water-damaged walls and ceilings, refinishing the floors, and restoring the electrical wiring that had been damaged on two of the floors.<\/p>\n<p>Next, improvements needed to be made on millwork and lighting additions that would make the most of the available square footage. In the freshly repainted entryway to the apartment, the Sweeten contractor fashioned a custom shoe cabinet to fit in a nook by the door, and a floating shelf above it. \u201cWe love that there\u2019s a place for our shoes, and we put recycling in the bins above,\u201d explains Carol. \u201cWe used to have a makeshift shelf there that only held about 10 pairs of shoes.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>On the main entertaining floor, the homeowners removed eight damaged recessed light \u201ccans\u201d from the ceiling above the dining table\u2014the number was excessive and felt institutional. Carol took advantage of the opportunity to replace them with two oversized white pendants with brass hardware and a cloth-bound cord that still provided plenty of light, while also giving the space a cozier feel. A modern brass fixture with LED lights was chosen as a statement piece for the living room area.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the renovation, a custom shelf stretched from the dining area through the living room to the windows. The shelves made the room seem narrower than it was, so Carol asked her Sweeten contractor to trim about 8 feet of the shelving. This allowed them to flip the living room configuration while converting some of the open shelving to closed storage via a new custom floating credenza.<\/p>\n<p>The contractor <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">salvaged enough<\/a> of the dismantled portion of the shelving and repurposed it as the counter surface for the unit. \u201cNow when you walk into the apartment, the TV isn\u2019t the first thing you see\u2014that was something that had bothered me about the previous setup.\u201d The Sweeten contractor fabricated the credenza with simple hanging boxes and white doors, and Carol chose streamlined brass pulls to complete the look.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43304 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Carol-bathroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"modern pink bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Carol-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Carol-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Carol-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The contractor added two accents via paint: a slim wall in the living room was painted with the same soft pink that was used in the powder room.<\/p>\n<p>Upstairs, on the bedroom level, the same repairs were performed as on the lower floor\u2014refinishing the floors, detecting any mold, and fixing water-damaged drywall. Additionally, Carol asked their contractor to add built-in floor-to-ceiling shelving to a narrow stretch of wall to both her son\u2019s room as well as the playroom\/guest room to house the growing collection of children\u2019s books they owned. In her son\u2019s room, they chose a dual-tone paint job, with the same pink (as used on the main level) on the lower half and a bright white on top.<\/p>\n<p>The two rooms, each just about eight-feet wide, are mirror images of each other, though the playroom has a closet. The lower half of that closet was turned into a cozy reading nook\u2014simply by adding a shelf to divide the closet into two. \u201cI have always loved secret kids\u2019 spaces in homes and this would be an easy way to add one,\u201d the homeowner explained. The upper portion of the closet is still used for clothes and toy storage.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, while the fa\u00e7ade of the building was still in good shape, some minor cosmetic updates improved <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the curb appeal<\/a>. The front door was painted a charcoal gray, and a large new mailbox was installed to replace two smaller rickety ones that couldn\u2019t hold anything larger than a standard envelope. A new, streamlined light fixture gave the traditional fa\u00e7ade a more modern twist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WATCH VIDEO:<\/strong> How Sara + Mike found their general contractor<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/iPKUGR3Ejb8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Now that the renovation is complete, the homeowners are happy to return to their lives. The repairs not only ensured a dry home, but also resulted in small but meaningful improvements. \u201cAll of the additional storage created by the credenza and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/22\/realestate\/beyond-the-built-in-bookcase.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=realestate&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;region=stream&amp;rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Frealestate&amp;version=latest\">built-ins<\/a> in the bedrooms helped to reduce visual clutter, and we are thrilled that we were able to put our own touches on this home,\u201d says Carol.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Carol and family, for sharing your Sweeten home with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>ENTRY RESOURCES.
