Gone are the days of the kitchen being cordoned off. No more swinging doors or small entryways. Renovators want big, open spaces that connect the kitchen to the dining area and sometimes to the living room, too. It is a modern concept that is both inviting and multifunctional.\u00a0It also can give a smaller space the appearance of more square footage.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, a look at six o<\/span>pen concept kitchen ideas from <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten renovations that make kitchens the star of the remodel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A soaring ceiling for the win<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"marble-countertop-kitchen-island\"  data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"marble countertop on kitchen island with white cabinets and brown vinyl flooring after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1250\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41789\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-240x300.jpg 240w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-600x750.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ann looked for a contractor for two years to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">update her dark and dated kitchen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in East Hampton. She wanted a space that was welcoming and large enough to accommodate her family and guests. A place that felt open and airy and just enjoyable to be in. She finally pulled the trigger on the renovation after finding a contractor through Sweeten. They teamed up to create the bright, airy kitchen of Ann\u2019s dreams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ann knew she wanted the faux-brick backsplash and dark cabinetry replaced with lighter, more modern options. To go along with that contemporary update, Ann also decided to remove the wall between the dining area and cook space. But the ultimate game-changer was the detail her contractor recommended: a cathedral ceiling. Bumping up the ceiling added a feeling of spaciousness far above and beyond just taking down a wall. It gives the space a grand appearance and regal style. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI just love having the open space, where everyone can sit and hang out together,\u201d Ann said.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A galley kitchen opens up<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"dining nook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41636\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elizabeth and Martin lived in their Bronx home<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for a year-and-a-half before they decided to renovate.

To make this happen, their Sweeten contractor took down the wall between the kitchen and entryway. He also removed a partial wall between the kitchen and dining, effectively connecting the two. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen cabinet styles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the kitchen was still on the smaller side, they had to get creative with storage. They included a peninsula breakfast bar that seats four to six and features additional storage. Glass-front cabinets, a microwave cabinet, and a built-in paper towel holder are all prime examples of their extra storage solutions. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen,\u201d said Elizabeth.

The conclusion? It was time to make the move to get more space. So they purchased a 1950s home in Los Angeles, California. From the get-go, they knew it needed to be remodeled to fit their work-from-home lifestyle. In addition to turning two of their three bedrooms into office space, they wanted to rethink their kitchen and living room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg\" alt=\"custom kitchen cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-49430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their Sweeten contractor recommended widening the kitchen doorway and removing part of the six-foot wall to help the L-shaped kitchen flow. This opened the kitchen up to the living area. To unify the two spaces that were now one, they chose white-oak engineered hardwood in eight-inch planks. They felt this would showcase the oak\u2019s natural grain and make the house\u2019s interior feel more cohesive. In addition, they created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. This gave them the additional room to add a large pantry\u2014a must-have for most renovators. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a gorgeous home with space for both of us to do our things,\u201d says Amy. \u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A more kid-friendly remodel<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"kitchen-peninsula-with-quartz-countertop\"  data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen peninsula with quartz countertop and pendant lighting after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51253\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Samantha-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Samantha-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Samantha is a stay-at-home mom and Jameson is an executive at a creative agency. They loved their Clinton Hill, Brooklyn co-op but it wasn\u2019t optimal for their family of four. The couple wanted a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/kid-friendly-apartment-renovation-with-soundproofing-and-open-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">space that was more kid-friendly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out,\u201d said Samantha. To achieve this they decided to renovate. They opened the kitchen to the living room. This way Samantha can see the family in the living room while she\u2019s cooking in the kitchen. Plus, they added a breakfast counter with a cut-out. It serves as the perfect setting for homework\u2014a win-win as Samantha can be doing dishes or prepping meals while she helps the kids with their school work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also rethought their old layout. They switched the dining area, which was previously by the window, with the living room sofa to make the table easily reachable. Samantha says her new open-concept kitchen is \u201can absolute pleasure.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>A tight New Jersey home gains valuable kitchen space<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Dining-1.jpg\" alt=\"open kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45614\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Dining-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Dining-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Dining-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When this Sweeten renovator and his wife moved to Montclair, New Jersey, they knew <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the home they bought needed a lot<\/a> of updates. The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kitchen <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was one of the first projects on their list. The house was almost a hundred years old and it looked its age. It was small, with \u201clooming\u201d cabinets all around. There were only eight feet of usable counter space. And the stove looked like it was out of a 1940s movie. Not to mention the cracked \u201cMcDonald&#8217;s\u201d tiles (red terracotta tiles that are found in some older McDonald&#8217;s restaurants).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg\" alt=\"New Jersey kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Warren-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of the renovation was to gain square footage and a better layout. Their Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plan was to tear down two walls. One had an old butler\u2019s pantry. By removing it, they gained 18 square feet of space. That was enough to add an island. They also turned the unused cellar entryway into a walk-in pantry. The other wall that they removed was between the kitchen and dining room. Once it was down, the kitchen really took shape\u2014their open-concept kitchen idea transformed the first floor with improved flow and natural light.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>An open concept kitchen idea joins minimalism with functionalism<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"kitchen-living-ding-in-one-stock\"  data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"open kitchen living and dining in one stock space and large window and hardwood floors and oak and white kitchen cabinets after renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roxana and Gabriel loved <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their Long Island City<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Queens, apartment, especially the 15-foot ceilings.
