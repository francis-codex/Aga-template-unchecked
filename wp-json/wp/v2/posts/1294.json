Your Name and your company\u2019s name?\u00a0 My name is Don Zuniga.\u00a0 I have a small company called &#8220;Color Your Space.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2. How long has the company been in business?\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been doing business for over 12 years, but only 2 years as CYS.<\/p>\n<p>3. How many people work at the company?\u00a0 Its a small company.\u00a0 I do most of the work, and have a part-time worker.\u00a0 I also know other skilled craftsmen who I work with on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>4. What is the specialty?\u00a0 I specialize in Interior Painting, but I also do faux finishes, molding, and wallpaper.<\/p>\n<p>5. How did you personally get into contracting?\u00a0 My dad is a contractor, so I grew up working and learning on his projects.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2679\/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\"  class=\"mb-0\" src=\"https:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2679\/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg\" alt=\"Color Your Space_three\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>6. Tell us about the job you\u2019re most proud of in your career?\u00a0 About 8 years ago, when I was first starting on my own in Boston, I restored a colonial brownstone in Jamaica Plains:\u00a0 the floors, tile, molding, and walls.\u00a0 It was amazing to see the difference, because it was in raw, worn-out shape, and when i finished, it was immaculate.\u00a0 I actually got 4 or 5 referrals from that job alone, and did some work for designers who saw my work.<\/p>\n<p>7.\u00a0Do you have a web site? Has it helped you get business?\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 My website is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coloryourspace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.coloryourspace.com<\/a> .\u00a0 It helps business because it gives people a sense of what I do, and lets then see some of my work.\u00a0 I think having a website shows people that you are invested, and legitimate, and not just a guy who started painting or doing this kind of work yesterday because he needs a way to make money.<\/p>\n<p>8.\u00a0Tell us about you\u2019re most nightmarish job?\u00a0 I was doing a wall repair and painting job on West 81st street and Riverside Drive a few years back.\u00a0 As I was working on a wall, the entire master bedroom wall began to crumble, because the plaster\u00a0 was so moist from rain damage.\u00a0 THE ENTIRE WALL.\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t anticipate that.\u00a0 You never know what&#8217;s going to happen when you start poking a damaged wall.<\/p>\n<p>9.\u00a0If you could change the construction process, how would you change it?\u00a0\u00a0 Its difficult to answer this, since each job is wholly different from another, so the process is always changing.<\/p>\n<p>10. If you weren\u2019t a contractor, what would you be?\u00a0 A lawyer.\u00a0 I have a law degree, but little desire to sit in a stuffy office with a suit on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>10 questions for contractor: Color Your Space Swee10 Profile: https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ 1.
