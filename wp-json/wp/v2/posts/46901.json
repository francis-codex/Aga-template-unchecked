Not to worry: here we outline what to know before you renovate a bathroom in the DC area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Defining the area around Washington DC<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC first means hammering down its geography.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\">The commonly held notion is that DC consists of the District, Southern Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Sweeten currently services <\/span><span class=\"s3\">the DC area, Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland, and select counties in Virginia, including Fairfax and Arlington.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Exterior architecture<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Part of what makes the DC area so appealing is its architecturally significant buildings. Many older and noteworthy buildings are within the District, specifically Georgetown, Capitol Hill, Adams Morgan, and Dupont.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Southern Maryland and Northern Virginia do have some historically important buildings, <\/span><span class=\"s4\">but not to the extent that the District does.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s2\">In the District, Preservation Reviews by the Office of Planning tend to concentrate on exterior work. Interior alterations and non-structural interior demolition are both permitted activities but are exempt from Preservation Reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Renovation bathroom costs in Washington DC<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The cost of remodeling a high-end bathroom in the South Atlantic region, which includes the DC metro area, is higher than the national average. Starting costs for a low-end bathroom remodel is $16,500. A mid-range budget starts at around $26,000. A high-end remodel starts at $38,000 for a 4\u2013 or 5\u2013piece bath. (You can read more in Sweeten\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-washington-dc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bathroom remodeling cost guide for Washington DC<\/a>). Contractors will be able to provide you with more detailed estimates after a site visit. It&#8217;s also important to meet with licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/washington-dc-renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractors in Washington DC<\/a> with local experience who are up-to-date on codes and regulations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>&#8220;Rip-and-replace&#8221; bathroom remodels in older homes<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\">A \u201crip-and-replace\u201d bathroom remodel will always save you money over a full remodel. Like the name says, fixtures are pulled out and replaced. The footprint does not change, nor does the drywall, subfloor, pipes, or wiring. In a \u201crip-and-replace,\u201d the most expensive items are the toilet, tub or shower, faucet, sink, and cabinet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\">But there is a catch: Washington <span class=\"s2\">DC<\/span>\u00a0has a significantly older housing stock. East of the Capitol, north of the K Street business district, up Georgia Avenue, and on either side of the 16th Street corridor, houses can be 100 years old or more. This means that a \u201crip-and-replace\u201d remodel is usually not possible if the bathroom is in its original state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\">Bathroom remodels for these older homes usually require a full gutting to expose the insides of the walls, including pipes and wiring. Knob-and-tube wiring, common in these homes, must be replaced with modern non-metallic wiring. Additionally, the service panel should be updated. When the studs are bowed or broken, they can be sistered with a parallel stud to the side.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\">Many of these older <span class=\"s2\">DC<\/span>\u00a0homes were solidly built with materials considered premium for their time. Common materials that <span class=\"s2\">DC<\/span>\u00a0homeowners will encounter are cast iron tubs, two-by-fours that actually measure 2 inches by 4 inches, heavy joists, and linoleum. These items can be difficult to remove. For example, homeowners removing cast-iron tubs will need to break or cut them apart on-site to assist with removal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">The effect of climate in DC\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The DC area can get hot\u2014<em>really<\/em> hot. While DC&#8217;s spring weather is pleasant, the summer climate turns quickly\u2014with record temperatures over 100 F and averages in the 80s. DC\u2019s high humidity keeps everything wet, especially moisture-prone bathrooms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Explore with a general contractor the full range of measures to keep condensation in the bathroom at bay:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Adequate bathroom exhaust fan<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Openable window, if possible<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Dehumidifier<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Heated flooring<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Wall heater<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Mold-resistant paint<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Install a moisture-resistant ceiling<\/li>\n<li>Use moisture-resistant materials such as waterproof drywall or ceramic tiles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Permits for Washington DC remodels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Bathroom remodeling permits are required in the District, Montgomery County, and Fairfax County.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">District: An Alteration and Repair Permit from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) is required. You must submit architectural plans. Since your bathroom remodel will likely be under the Department\u2019s 1,000-square-foot cut-off, you can have your bathroom remodel project fast-tracked with a counter review.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Montgomery County: The Department of Permitting Services will require a Residental Alteration permit. You may need additional electrical and mechanical permits, too.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s2\">Fairfax County: Land Development Services requires a permit for interior alterations, as well as for individual projects related to bathroom remodeling such as installing new plumbing fixtures.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Building approvals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC proper generally will be more involved than in the suburbs due to the larger number of condos and other board-controlled buildings. Within DC, this will be less of an issue as you move northward to Tenleytown, Petworth, Chevy Chase, and Takoma since more single-family residences are located there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Even though you own everything within the walls of the condo, condo boards typically require that you submit alteration plans for approval or attend meetings to discuss your proposal. Bathroom remodels are of special interest since these projects touch on critical services such as electrical and plumbing that affect other units. Logistics like parking for workers, elevator usage, and demolition removal must be considered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Condo boards each have their own personalities and requirements. Board approval can be tricky. But if you are working with an experienced general contractor for the bathroom remodel, they will help you navigate the approval process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Remodeling a bathroom in Washington DC? Now is the time.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Don&#8217;t let the possible challenges of remodeling a DC bathroom stop you. There are clear benefits of remodeling to consider; like creative exploration, personal enjoyment, and higher resale value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to\u00a0<span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovate with the best contractors<\/a> in Washington DC<\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46413\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post a Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
