With the costs of buying my first home, renovating wasn\u2019t something I could take on immediately.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This summer, however, my fianc\u00e9 is moving in. So,\u00a0after a year of living with a less than optimal kitchen, I did a bit of financial planning and I decided to bite the bullet and take the leap to do a renovation-on-a-budget.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-cabinets-black-floor-before-renovation\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48016 mb-48\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg\" alt=\"small kitchen with white cabinets and square backsplash tiles and black floor before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>The Planning Process\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I started planning in early April, starting with where I would purchase my kitchen (easy, Ikea), whether I would replace my appliances (initially no, but then decided it would be better from a resale perspective to have \u201clarger\u201d appliances), and how I would find a contractor (um, who knew?).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets<\/strong><\/span> &#8211;\u00a0<\/i>I planned a day out to Brooklyn Ikea with my fianc\u00e9, sister, and friend, mostly for moral support, but also because who doesn\u2019t like to spend a day hanging out in Ikea?\u00a0 I had at that point pored through the catalogue and had a general idea of what I wanted, which ended up being what I chose: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AKURUM in Lidi White<\/a>.\u00a0While at Ikea, I learned more about the planning services they offer, and I was happy to pay $99 for someone to come over and measure my kitchen and upload the specifications into the Ikea Kitchen Planner (more on how this worked out below)\u00a0before I started playing pretend architect and interior designer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Appliances<\/strong><\/span> &#8211;\u00a0<\/i>I decided to replace my 20 inch range with a 24 inch range, my small white refrigerator with a shiny new LG \u201cskinny\u201d fridge, keep my 17 inch wide dishwasher because I had never actually used it, and install a range hood (even though it wouldn\u2019t vent outside, I thought it must help somewhat to circulate the air above the cooktop).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Contractors<\/strong><\/span> &#8211;\u00a0<\/i>I spoke with 5 contractors, each of whom I found via a different source.\u00a0 The first was through Ikea\u2019s primary contractor, which was the company that came to measure my kitchen.\u00a0 The second, I found while trolling through ikeafans.com.\u00a0 The third was an independent contractor, introduced to me through a friend.\u00a0 The fourth was a contact of my mother\u2019s.\u00a0 The last was through a submission to Sweeten, which I had read about in a blog post on Apartment Therapy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ultimately, I made the decision to go with #5, Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros, who I was matched to by theSweeten.\u00a0 Peter was professional, thorough, and committed to staying within our agreed upon budget.\u00a0 He even sat down with me prior to my big purchase at Ikea just to make sure I didn\u2019t miss minor things like toe kicks and hinges and the like.\u00a0 As we all know, going to Ikea for small items is a big pain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Countertops, Flooring and Backsplash<\/strong><\/span> &#8211;\u00a0<\/i>I also ended up going through Peter\u2019s contact for my countertops. It was something I had not originally planned for, but I am glad I decided to go with quartz as opposed to the laminate that Ikea sells. It took me two trips to Williamsburg and a comparison trip to Home Depot, but I now have amazing gray stone countertops that really lift the whole look and feel of the kitchen, I love it.\u00a0My backsplash and floor tiles were a simple purchase made on homedepot.com, since I already had an idea of what I wanted \u2013 gray stone-like laminate tiles and a clear glass backsplash.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"demolished-kitchen-during-renovation\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48014 mb-48\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg\" alt=\"demolished kitchen with only sink remaining during renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/Lisa-GuestPost-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>The Renovation Process<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All I have to say is that your choice in contractor drives your overall experience, because you must trust that things will get done according to your expectations from a quality and time-frame perspective.

Not only was everything done on time, which I have heard almost never happens, but it was really pretty painless.
