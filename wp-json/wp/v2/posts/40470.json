At Sweeten, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors, we take a pretty hard stance on that fact. Numbers also show that homeowners often regret taking on DIY projects.

To see real-life examples of those ideas, check out these Sweeten remodels below, where renovators completed a few small DIY projects themselves, plus DIY jobs that ultimately led to the homeowners hiring a contractor.<\/p>\n<h3>DIY: Painting cabinets<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-21436 size-full\" title=\"black kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg\" alt=\"black kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As architects, Kate and Arthur know a thing or two about renovations.

The couple also decided to take on a few small projects themselves, including building out the IKEA kitchen cabinets and painting the fronts (26 panels, some over 10 feet tall). They warned potential DIYers: only take on a do-it-yourself project like this \u201cif you have the time, patience, and space.\u201d While it was a money-saving exercise, it took a took almost a full month to paint the cabinets, plus they had to do the work in their own apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>DIY: Installing wallpaper<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32900 size-full\" title=\"wallpapered bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg\" alt=\"wallpapered bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-10-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flipping the floors of a Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone to move the rental apartment to the garden-floor was no small project.
