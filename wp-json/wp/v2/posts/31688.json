Olivia, a journalist, and Greg, a lawyer, thought the neighborhood would be perfect for kids with\u00a0its beautiful parks, play areas, and museums. The apartment had great details\u2014large windows, plenty of light, built-in bookshelves, and nice moldings\u2014but needed a serious refresh.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/20608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">They posted their project<\/a>\u00a0on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found the right\u00a0contractor<\/a>\u00a0to create the contemporary look they were after. They wanted to update the kitchen and\u00a0a bathroom\u2014which later became both bathrooms\u2014with new tiles and fixtures, plus enlarge the master bathroom. In the\u00a0master bedroom, they needed a brand new built-in closet. But the pressure to finish before their baby&#8217;s birth added an extra layer of stress and it all came down to the wire.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31699 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31826 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7407-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Olivia-Cabinet-GIF.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31873 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"white-glass-panelled-kitchen-cabinets\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Olivia-Cabinet-GIF.gif\" alt=\"white glass panelled kitchen cabinets over marble countertop and closed kitchen cabinets underneath after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their previous kitchen in the West Village was small and they were excited to trade up to the larger space in their new home. Pipes in the walls made it difficult to move anything, so to keep costs down, they kept the same footprint. The existing kitchen cabinets were a mismatched black-and-white assortment, and Olivia imagined her dream space as a modern, all-white kitchen. They decided to reface most of the cabinets, painting them white with new hardware. The cabinets above the sink didn\u2019t correctly fit the space, so custom cabinetry was\u00a0crafted for the uppers as well as the lower cabinetry in the midsection of the kitchen, where pots and pans\u00a0used to hang. There, another piece was designed to fit the space better with more storage built above, featuring glass doors to display their wedding china and glassware.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31700 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7415.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31827 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7415-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The shower was so tiny, Olivia said, By the middle of my pregnancy, I could barely fit in it!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7439.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31828 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/MG_7439-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the couple loves to cook and are big cookbook collectors, they created a nook to display some of their favorites. They kept the appliances, which were brand new. For the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floors<\/a>, porcelain tile resembling dark wood that was more durable and stain-resistant replaced the\u00a0old red tile.\u00a0\u201cDefinitely a plus with a new baby,\u201d\u00a0Olivia said. Now, the wood look matched the rest of the apartment.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31767 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Before\u00a0of the master bathroom<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath07-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31712 mt-24 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath07-1-723x978.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"978\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both bathrooms were outdated. In the master bath, the shower was so tiny, Olivia said, \u201cBy the middle of my pregnancy, I could barely fit in it!\u201d The fixtures were old and the shower floor was plastic rather than tile. They really wanted a larger, more luxurious master bath and their dream was to have double vanities. To achieve this, they took space from an existing hallway and a closet in the master bedroom.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31704 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their Sweeten contractor was able to design a seat in the shower to look like it was floating, sizing it just right so it wouldn\u2019t take up too much space. \u201cWe wanted something that looked good but was also functional so that I could shave my legs and relax during a hot shower,\u201d Olivia said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath18-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31715 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath18-1-723x1000.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Guest bathroom<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31707 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath19-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath20.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31708 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath20-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They ended up adding the guest bathroom about two months into the project\u2014it was not in the original budget. \u201cI ended up convincing Greg that if we didn&#8217;t update it now, it would never get done, especially with the baby coming when we would be very preoccupied,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cOur contractor was able to work with us to get it done in a cost-effective and timely manner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The walls were painted dark gray in stark contrast to the bright white vanity and shower subway tiles. Olivia\u00a0was inspired by the restaurant Union Fare in Union Square and wanted to replicate the style. \u201cThe contractor initially thought we were crazy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he ended up liking it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before09.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31703 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation Manhattan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above, inset) Before of the master bedroom closet wall<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Olivia-Closet-GIF.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31874 mt-24 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"gray-closet-niche-tv\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Olivia-Closet-GIF.gif\" alt=\"gray closet with handles in bedroom with niche for tv after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To replace the lost closet in the master bedroom, their contractor\u00a0created an envy-inducing new unit from California Closets. He was meticulous in his measuring to make sure that they could still have a king-sized bed, two nightstands, and closet doors that wouldn&#8217;t open up into the bed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Designwise, they wanted\u00a0adequate space for\u00a0the two of them to hang clothes and for well-spaced shelving to fit items like sweaters. \u201cI\u2019m also pretty short,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cso we had to make sure that the hanging bar was low enough that I could still access my dresses and sweaters. The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/closet-renovation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closets<\/a> are amazing and really feel like a huge luxury.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As if remodeling isn\u2019t stressful enough, the pressure to stay on schedule was ever present. They <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moved out<\/a> during the renovation. \u201cWe had tools and dust littering the baby\u2019s nursery just two weeks before Olivia&#8217;s due date, which definitely made us all nervous,\u201d Greg said. Luckily, their Sweeten contractor was extremely responsive to them any time of day. \u201cAs <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/how-5-couples-renovated-together\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first-time homeowners<\/a>, we had a million questions, and he couldn&#8217;t have been nicer and more professional to deal with,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHe also has an incredible eye for design, so we didn&#8217;t need to hire an outside designer to help us make decisions for items like the backsplash or tiles.\u201d They shared their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/sweetenhome\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a> boards and their contractor pulled materials matching their inspiration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even as newbies, though, the couple had faith in the process. They learned to be patient and to check up on the work as often as they could to get in front of any problems. They discovered that \u201crenovating can be addicting! Once you start, you&#8217;ll begin to realize all the imperfections in your home which could add on tens of thousands of dollars to your project,\u201d said Olivia. \u201cBut don\u2019t get distracted. Stick with the original plan; you can always renovate again at another point.\u201d In the end, it all worked out. The renovations were done in early December and Max was born the day after Christmas.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Olivia and Greg, for sharing your home with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Kitchen: Cabinet hardware: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.richelieu.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Richelieu<\/a>.
