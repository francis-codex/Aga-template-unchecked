In this guide, Sweeten shares key tips to how to smooth the process to close projects and getting signed contracts. These practices will reduce time and effort for you while reducing anxiety for the homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Establish a process and communicate it early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019re the pro\u2014it\u2019s up to <em>you<\/em> to know everything you\u2019ll need from the client, and when you\u2019ll need it. Having an established process will help you show confidence and authority, which earns confidence from clients. You may find it helpful to map out the process in writing, even if those notes are just for your own use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you sense you\u2019re getting positive feedback from the client, you can start discussing next steps as early as the site visit. At the latest, you\u2019ll want to start these discussions when you deliver your estimate.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Communicate clearly and transparently<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t be shy about discussing your process with the homeowner. Most clients, especially first-time renovators, will be comforted by a confident contractor who leads them through the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some GCs avoid bringing up critical steps, like contracts and payment plans, out of fear that this will scare the homeowner away. Don\u2019t fall into this trap! It\u2019s always better to be upfront. Your transparency inspires confidence and will help you avoid springing surprises on the homeowner at the last minute.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Consider these points:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Are you asking for a large payment upfront? <\/span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">If yes, explain why\u2014for example, to order materials early and avoid delays, to secure your crew, etc. Conversely, if your payment schedule is flexible or you are asking for a relatively low percentage upfront, use that as a selling point.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Will you take care of permits? If so, which ones? Will there be any costs associated with this work? <\/span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Be sure to clearly communicate what will be on the homeowner\u2019s plate to manage and pay for versus what you are providing as value-added services.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Encourage questions!\u00a0<\/span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Homeowners appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and a healthy dialogue gives you the chance to demonstrate your expertise and listening skills. An informed client is a good client.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Some questions to be prepared for:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><i><\/i><span class=\"s3\"><i>Can you revise the estimate (itemizing, reorganizing, taking things out, or adding additional line items in, etc.)?<br \/>\n<\/i><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Be sure to set boundaries. Let the client know how many revisions you&#8217;re willing to make.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><i><\/i><span class=\"s3\"><i>Is the estimate negotiable?<br \/>\n<\/i><\/span><span class=\"s5\">Emphasize that you&#8217;ll work with them on revising their project scope to fit the budget. Set limits on how much time you&#8217;ll invest for free without a commitment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><i><\/i><span class=\"s3\"><i>Can I get a discount?<br \/>\n<\/i><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Here it&#8217;s usually best to stand behind your work, and emphasize that you&#8217;ve already made your bid as competitive as possible. But make sure this is the truth! It&#8217;s always best to start with a competitive bid than with a high or low estimate or other sales gimmick.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Explain the contract<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before you send the contract, let the homeowner know what to expect beforehand.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Will you send a digital contract or paper one?\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li><span class=\"s3\"><em>Pro Tip: Most clients prefer digital documentation. Use Sweeten&#8217;s e-signature feature to get contracts signed faster.\u00a0<\/em><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Tell the homeowner that you\u2019re comfortable with answering their questions about your contract.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">If you use a standard boilerplate contract, send it with your estimate\u2014don\u2019t wait for the client to beg!<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">If you include your contract with the estimate, be sure to remind the client that it\u2019s there.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Always include a time limit in your contract\u2014 &#8220;This estimate is good for 60 days,&#8221; etc. Make sure the client understands this. This speeds the process along, and protects you from a client showing up years later expecting the same deal.<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In summary<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Knowing how to close projects with clients takes practice and care. <span class=\"s1\">Always think about what you can do to inspire confidence and trust. Taking the lead, being open and honest, transparent in your communications, and clearly explaining your contract will all help you win the client\u2019s trust\u2014and win the job.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/general-contractor-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to know how to close projects?
