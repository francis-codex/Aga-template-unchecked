This is because painting is mainly about labor\u2014and it does require skill if your walls need a lot of prep work. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Phil<\/a> says that this job is a good candidate for a DIY because it\u2019s \u201cconfined, not noisy, and relatively easy. Prep work is the hard part, so a homeowner could outsource that part and just do the painting.\u201d Importantly, \u201cit\u2019s at the end of the project, you don\u2019t hold anything up.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>DO: Work that requires minimal tools<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a patient person with attention to detail, you can also assemble your own modular kitchen cabinets and closet systems, while outsourcing the installation to a general contractor. Many modular projects, such as those from IKEA, are geared toward homeowner assembly, so they require minimal skills and tools.\u00a0 You can now find wallpaper that is installation-friendly. In general, though, you may need a second set of hands to help with this detailed-oriented task.<\/p>\n<h2><b>What to Leave for the Pros<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Demolition<\/li>\n<li>Plumbing or electrical work<\/li>\n<li>Any kind of structural work<\/li>\n<li>Skim coating<\/li>\n<li>Tilework<\/li>\n<li>Flooring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Often, it may not be advisable for a homeowner to take on renovation projects, even if they feel capable. In many urban apartment buildings, for example, you are governed by co-op, condo, and city regulations that require a professional to undertake any contracting work. Your building will require your contractor to provide a license and insurance information to hold the firm accountable for the work being done in your home. If you do the work yourself, you could get yourself and your general contractor into trouble.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Follow Sweeten on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sweeten_home\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a> for endless renovation inspiration<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sweeten_home\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43094 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Instagram-Grid-Blog-Strip.jpg\" alt=\"Sweeten Instagram\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Instagram-Grid-Blog-Strip.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Instagram-Grid-Blog-Strip-300x60.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Instagram-Grid-Blog-Strip-600x120.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>DON\u2019T: Take on demolition, plumbing, or electrical<\/h3>\n<p>Rules and regulations aside, there is also the matter of safety. Sweeten general contractor Phil told us that he\u2019s had clients ask to do their own demolition in the past. \u201cIt may seem easy, but actually, there\u2019s a lot to consider,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You create a lot of garbage; how do you get it out? What if you damage something that you have to preserve? What if you get hurt in the process?\u201d These considerations also guide our recommendation that anything structural, or involving plumbing or electricity, is best left to the professionals.<\/p>\n<h3>DON&#8217;T: Consider skim coating<\/h3>\n<p>Skim coating is a process that hand-applies a layer of mud used in construction over the surface of your walls and ceilings and is then smoothed by hand. General contractor Walter strongly advises against a homeowner from taking on this task. &#8220;Spackling takes a lot of skill and practice that should be left to a professional,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If done incorrectly it would ruin the finished product of the job.&#8221; Jean talks about <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skim coating here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>DON\u2019T: Install flooring or tiles<\/h3>\n<p>Flooring and tile work are other areas that homeowners often consider DIYing. Depending on the level of difficulty and your own experience with this type of work, you may attempt to take it on. But if you\u2019ve never done it before, you may not be able to execute it properly. Any mistakes will have to be fixed by the contractor, which delays the project and costs everyone time and your money.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/clean-up-after-major-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43105 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg\" alt=\"clean up after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"85\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/CleanUpAfter-BlogPost-Embed-1-600x51.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>DON\u2019T: Take on projects that may cause delay<\/h3>\n<p>The final consideration that Sweeten contractors point out is timing. If a DIY project is something that must happen in the middle of the project and be finished before the rest of the work can continue, homeowners must complete the DIY project when they say they will. Otherwise, the entire project falls behind.<\/p>\n<p>General contractors are responsible for scheduling their workers, as well as any subcontractors for electrical or plumbing work, to make sure everyone\u2019s job is completed in a timely fashion. If you, as the homeowner, have not finished assembling the kitchen cabinets, they can\u2019t be mounted, the countertops cannot go in, the backsplash cannot be installed. (You get the picture.) These delays can be very costly. For this reason, the best DIY projects tend to be those that happen at the end of a renovation (like painting!).<\/p>\n<p>With these do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts in mind, go ahead and take on the tasks that give the professionals the space they need to keep your renovation moving along on schedule. You\u2019ll soon be enjoying your new space with a touch of your own handiwork.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Here are the top remodeling projects to consider if you&#8217;re <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/renovating-your-home-for-resale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">renovating for resale<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
