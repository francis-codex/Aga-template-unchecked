They were drawn to the unique history of the Clinton Hill Co-ops built in 1941 by the U.S. Navy as housing for workers at the then-bustling Navy Yard. They bought a unit on the second floor that hadn\u2019t been renovated since the mid-&#8217;80s.<\/p>\n\n<p>It had the original parquet floors, faux-granite Formica countertops, and a badly-configured floor plan that wasted valuable space. While the non-functional kitchen\/dining space was the reason for the project, by the end, every wall, ceiling, and flooring had been either gutted or resurfaced.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-26.jpg\" alt=\"living room with slatted room divider\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-18.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-18-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-25.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Tom, a Brooklyn real estate agent, knew that a more functional, ergonomic space with better flow and storage could be achieved. For their own apartment remodel, the project enlisted Sweeten homeowners and also designers Casey and Kumar of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.studiomilleratre.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studio Miller Atre<\/a> for a conceptual design that matched their lifestyle and design taste. Their Sweeten contractor, along with their architect, David, completed the professional team.<\/p>\n<p>Casey and Kumar established a mix of materials that would include the mid-century decor they loved. Throughout the home, original art from family members, Braniff International Airways collectibles from the &#8217;60s, and textiles from designer Alexander Girard personalized the space.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Not only did it feel like 300 square feet was added to the apartment but realized after this project was complete that it was worth every single penny.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-17.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-17-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-16.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-16-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Living room and kitchen\u2014separate but unified<\/h3>\n<p>Since the dining\/kitchen area opened directly into the living room, a partition was created to allow for visual flow while defining the two spaces. Vertical, floor-to-ceiling walnut slats complemented the surrounding mid-century decor. The wood slats would tie the walnut seen in both rooms\u2014the kitchen cabinets and floating walnut decorative wall panel in the living room.<\/p>\n<p>A favorite purchase was a modular Vitsoe 606 unit that became their workspace in the living room. \u201cIt was designed by German industrial designer Dieter Rams, and first produced by Vitsoe in Denmark in 1961,&#8221; said Alex. &#8220;We were looking for a simple, highly flexible desk\/wall unit that also looked really good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the dining area, the designers dropped the ceiling by five inches to install wiring for the dining room pendant and a recessed light dimming system. The outdated electrical system was often overloaded by modern-day appliances. A new electrical panel supported heavier usage. More electrical outlets were added in convenient locations throughout the apartment.<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century kitchen\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-09-10.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-09-10.gif\" alt=\"mid-century kitchen\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century kitchen\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Bringing the kitchen up-to-speed<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seen through the walnut slats, the kitchen\u2019s white-and-walnut theme was offset by a geometric <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-materials-101\/kitchen-backsplash-materials-for-your-kitchen-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tile backsplash<\/a> and quartz countertops. Matte black hardware provided simple, linear contrast while wooden pendants added warmth. The dishwasher and sink were moved to more logical locations, while full-height uppers and the wall of cabinets surrounding the refrigerator provide ample storage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the new island, there are deep pull-out drawers for pots and pans, as well as integrated plastic bins for trash and recycling, making it simple to wipe crumbs and other debris from the island directly into the trash can. The extra countertop surface allows multiple people to work in the kitchen at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century bathroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century bathroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century bathroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A multi-textural bathroom<\/h3>\n<p>In the bathroom, the bathtub was converted to a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower\/\">walk-in shower<\/a> with a large, sliding glass door. A pedestal sink replaced a vanity with storage. The walnut, white, and black palette anchored by a bold leafy wallpaper along one wall lends a luxurious feel. They also indulged in a washlet toilet, with a heated seat and dryer.<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century bedroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"mid-century bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"mid-century bedroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A functional bedroom with mid-century decor<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, the bedroom received a refresh. Closet doors went all the way to the ceiling, powder-coated wire shelving was added, and automatic lights were installed\u2014a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d said Tom. Behind the headboard, the couple pulled in a textured grasscloth wallpaper at Casey\u2019s suggestion. \u201cShe brought us countless options for material choices we never would have considered on our own,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Her solid design instincts allowed her to really tune into our personal tastes and preferences.\u201d A Braniff Boeing 707 model, built from a plastic kit, now hangs from the ceiling in the bedroom.<\/p>\n<h3>The renovation process<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their Sweeten contractor was the perfect choice for executing their vision\u2014in personality, budget, and in his attention to detail. \u201cHis team was brilliant in their execution of Casey and Kumar\u2019s design concept. He was always available when we needed to work something out, and consistently offered the solutions we required. The quality and finish of the work are both top-notch,\u201d Alex shared.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking back, the homeowners share that the most difficult issue about the renovation was \u201cwrapping our heads around spending bigger sums of money. Neither of us had been through this process before, and there was a certain trepidation even after we had committed to construction.\u201d They were, however, able to finance the project with equity that they had built since owning the apartment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And as a real estate agent, Tom knew that the substantial increase in the apartment\u2019s resale value justified the overall cost. \u201cIn the end, we reminded ourselves that we are both staunchly home-centric people who place a great deal of value on the comfort and serenity that only a beautiful, functional home can give us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not only did it feel like 300 square feet was added to the apartment but realized after this project was complete that it was worth every single penny.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Materials<\/h3>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: PID Engineered wood flooring: custom.
