Here&#8217;s everything you need to know.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47745 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Sweeten-Screens-GC-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sweeten wants general contractors who can do all of the construction work for every type of renovation project, right? Actually, wrong! While prior construction experience is great, many factors go into the process of hiring general contractors and adding them to the platform. Want to know what goes into vetting general contractors at Sweeten? Here, we outline the key factors <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> considers when vetting general contractors and approving them. (Plus, there&#8217;s a breakdown highlighting the difference between a general contractor and subcontractor!)<\/p>\n<h3><b>What is a general contractor?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A general contractor finds and manages experts to complete a construction project. Sometimes, the contractor themself may have background experience in construction. Or, the contractor may actually do some specialized work, like framing a room or doing tile work. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The kind of general contractor you&#8217;ll need depends on the type of project you\u2019re doing! If you\u2019re starting a ground-up project for a brand-new office building, you\u2019ll need a contractor with experience in commercial construction or office buildings. If you were starting a luxury home bathroom project, you&#8217;d want a contractor who specializes in luxury bathrooms. (Luckily, Sweeten does this homework for you by expertly matching individual projects with the right type of contractor!)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>General contractor vs. subcontractor<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>General contractors<\/strong> organize experts from other trades and then bring them together to complete a project. For example, for a bathroom remodel, a general contractor would find experts in electrical, plumbing, and potentially painting work for the job.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Subcontractors<\/strong> are the experts specifically trained in a trade. In the bathroom remodel example, subcontractors would do the actual electrical, plumbing, or painting work. MEPs (Mechanical, electrical and plumbing) are the most frequently subcontracted trades, mainly because these trades are highly skilled and require special licenses or registrations. General Contractors may choose to subcontract out various trades depending on the scope of the project.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>How does Sweeten choose general contractors?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten considers several factors when reviewing contractors:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That they have proof of insurance and licenses in Sweeten&#8217;s service areas<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photos of previous work<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">References from previous projects<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contractor\u2019s online presence, from professional websites to reviews or social media business accounts\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication style\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Length of time in business (a minimum of 6 months)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have insurance?<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors are required to carry insurance.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a contractor is in a state that doesn\u2019t require them to carry insurance, (Texas, for example,) Sweeten still requires that they get a certificate of insurance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Sweeten offers up to $50,000 in financial protection, that coverage is in addition to the separate insurance policy required of all Sweeten contractors.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li>The three most common types of insurance carried by contractors are general liability, workman&#8217;s compensation, and auto liability insurance.<\/li>\n<li>Workman&#8217;s compensation is useful for projects that require a crew to be on site.<\/li>\n<li>Auto liability insurance is useful for when a general contractor is parking on your property.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have licenses?<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors carry licenses when available for residential renovation projects where they work.\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that different states have different licensing requirements? It&#8217;s true! Fortunately, Sweeten checks licenses at both the state and\/or county level.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, Sweeten actively monitors the expiration dates of general contractor licenses. In fact, any general contractor with an expired license is not matched to new projects. This does two things:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensures Sweeten contractors are staying up-to-date with their licenses<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prevents Sweeten contractors from working on projects until their licenses are up-to-date<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>What kinds of contractors work with Sweeten?\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, Sweeten works with general contractor teams of all sizes! From single-person firms who subcontract out labor to contractors with dozens of employees on their payroll.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regional trends also affect the size of firms. Some markets, like Los Angeles, tend to offer more one-stop-shop firms. This is compared to cities like Atlanta and Chicago, who have a wealth of independently-owned &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; firms<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Does it cost money to join Sweeten&#8217;s network?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It is completely free for all general contractors to join the Sweeten platform.<\/li>\n<li>Contractors do not pay for access to leads on Sweeten.<\/li>\n<li>General contractors pay a fee, from 3% to 6%, of any awarded contracts they win on Sweeten.<\/li>\n<li>In this model, contractors only pay when they win projects on Sweeten&#8217;s platform.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now you have all the information that goes into vetting general contractors at Sweeten!
