New management and budgets cuts were taking place. At the time, I was also interning at the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulations. I learned about the lack of women-owned construction companies in the state. It just clicked: With my father&#8217;s remodeling experience and my desire to create a more stable future for our family, there was an opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">I asked my father if he would partner up with me to start our own construction company. He would lead the field team and do installations. I would spread the word about his knowledge and experience to home remodelers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Our first project was with a homeowner who hired us to build a small kitchen pantry. Little by little, we were recommended to neighbors and became known as a reliable and easy-to-work-with contractor in the community. Over time, we took on an array of projects in DC and Virginia, from simple build-outs to full bathroom, kitchen, and basement remodels. We grew into the experienced company we are today!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you love most about what you do as a general contractor?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The best part of our job is getting the chance to change the sometimes negative narratives about contractors. From time to time we have customers come to us after bad experiences. We aspire to leave all of our customers with good impressions and a first-hand example of what a good experience with a great contracting company can look like. I like to treat my customers how I would like to be treated, with respect, good communication, and quality service. &#8220;Do good unto others&#8221; are words I live by.<\/span><span class=\"s4\"> <\/span><span class=\"s1\">We enjoy putting that into practice in every aspect of what we do. Ultimately, I love being able to make people feel happy with the remodeling experience as a whole.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The biggest misconception is that a renovation is going to be overwhelming and complicated. With proper planning, preparation, and communication, a renovation can be fun the entire way through!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite renovation project that you\u2019ve done and why?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We recently completed a full condo remodel in Arlington, Virginia. The homeowner was a woman who wanted to work with a woman-owned contracting firm, a woman-owned interior design company, and a woman-owned virtual assistant company. From beginning to end, the remodel was spearheaded and completed by a team of women-owned companies. The project turned out gorgeous and it was truly so much fun. We celebrated with a fabulous housewarming party that our customer invited us to. It was really neat to be able to experience the space we helped create!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC\/Arlington\/Fairfax, VA building?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">My favorite building in the Washington DC area is the Spy Museum building. It is designed to look very modern and futuristic. I can appreciate the architecture and the way it stands out in the landscape. It&#8217;s worth checking out!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC\/Arlington\/Fairfax, VA restaurant?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">MoMo Sushi in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. They have the most delicious and fresh sushi I have ever had. It is also nestled in the cutest neighborhood close to the Old Town waterfront with great views of the Potomac River and Washington, DC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>If you weren\u2019t a general contractor, what would you be doing?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If I weren&#8217;t a general contractor, I&#8217;d own a coffee shop. You can find me trying a new latte and reviewing plan sheets at all of the local coffee shops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Originally published October 19, 2021<\/p>\n<p>Updated July 20, 2023<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\"><i>Check out S<\/i><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><i>weeten general contractor <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7193#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jennifer&#8217;s portfolio of work<\/a>.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Jennifer has been a Sweeten contractor since August 2021.\u00a0<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text] This DC-based, woman-owned general contractor strives to do good for others At\u00a0Sweeten, the experts in our network are experienced contractors and design pros we\u2019d be thrilled to have working in our own homes.
