The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we\u2019d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye<\/span><span class=\"s2\">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn\u2019t stand showering in there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn\u2019t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black-owned general contractors<\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted my project<\/a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/meet-sweeten-contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">woman-owned general contracting firm<\/a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48164 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg\" alt=\"blue bathroom with vanity and toilet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, \u201cWhat does a bathroom remodel cost?\u201d We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor\u2019s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom remodel Atlanta with subway shower tile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48171\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg\" alt=\"in-shower storage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor\u2014in marble\u2014as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Coaching and seeking economy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There were moments when I felt like, \u201cWe just can\u2019t afford to do this the right way,\u201d but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). <\/span><span class=\"s1\">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction\u2014including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48289 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg\" alt=\"color in bathroom\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The final budget\u2014and excellent outcome<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cost for a bathroom remodel<\/a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The final result feels larger and is the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spa bathroom<\/a> of my dreams. It\u2019s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It\u2019s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality.
