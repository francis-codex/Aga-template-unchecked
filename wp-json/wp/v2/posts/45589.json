Every project seems to announce itself with equal priority. Unless you\u2019re awash in money and time, you cannot address all at once. You need to sift through your priorities\u2014starting with knowing where to splurge vs. save during a renovation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Below, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> helps you understand where to splurge vs. save so you can define your priorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What does splurging mean?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurging doesn\u2019t mean overspending. It can mean shifting money from one project to another. Or placing one project higher on the to-do list than other projects. Splurge on things that you touch or see often. Splurge on things that are meaningful to you or which make you happy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What does saving mean?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Saving doesn\u2019t mean to skip or ignore. It means that you can safely put it on the back burner for now. Or if you want to do it, you can dial down on the cost a bit. Many times, after the project has been on the back burner long enough, you might see it in a clearer light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you think in terms of splurge vs. save during a renovation, all of these home projects fall into an order that makes perfect sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: Kitchens<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Splurge: Kitchen Countertops<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Every day, you touch, see, and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/primer-kitchen-countertops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">use your kitchen countertops<\/a>. Whether you choose quartz, solid surface, natural stone, laminate, or wood, your countertop choice is semi-permanent. After the design, fabrication, and installation, changing out your countertop shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. If you want a certain type of quartz countertop, but choose a shade or pattern that you don\u2019t feel strongly about, ask yourself: How will I feel about this in a year?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Kitchen Appliances<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen appliances are better designed than ever. The rising tide of improved kitchen technology lifts all boats\u2014even for lower-priced appliances. With research, you can find lower-cost refrigerators, dishwashers, cooktops, and ranges that fit your needs. These appliances often match or exceed the quality of higher-priced versions from only a few years ago.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Bathrooms<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Bathroom Fixtures<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Bathroom fixtures are more than just mechanical devices. They aren&#8217;t just knobs and levers that start and stop the water. Fixtures are ornaments that complement a beautiful shower, tub, or sink. Spend more to splurge vs. save for bathroom fixtures that make you happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Bathroom Technology<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Technology has entered all parts of our lives, so why not the bathroom, too? IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a concept that describes how common things within our life are now Internet-equipped. Bathroom technology and IoT are not gimmicks! IoT devices can track water usage, regulate heating, and allow the bathroom to better adapt to your needs. Bathroom technology has its place, and it is the future. But for now, you can limit your bathroom smart devices or put them on the back burner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Living rooms<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Paint<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">That designer paint that you\u2019ve been eyeing? Now it can be yours. You can easily justify spending more on the premium paint that you want in the living room. That\u2019s because the living room gets so much facetime, and it\u2019s so public. Poor quality paint may flake, chip, or fade over time, costing more in the end. When you decide to splurge instead of save on your desired paint, you\u2019ll be happier in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Lighting<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Living room lighting, while necessary, does not need to be expensive. Prioritize the shape and the finish of the lighting fixture over the brand name. One trick of designers is to over-scale lighting fixtures for a dramatic look. Just make sure that all of the in-wall wiring for sconces and ceiling lights is complete first!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Bedrooms<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Bedroom Closet systems<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">An unfinished closet is an empty box waiting for your stuff. However, that stuff has no place to go unless you create a system. Gone are the days of the closet rod with one shelf above it. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/closet-renovation-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Closet storage systems<\/a> belong in all closets now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Reach-in closets benefit from a shoe fence or shoe cubby, two or three drawers, and plenty of open shelving, plus a closet rod. Walk-in closets should be outfitted with the same and more: additional shelves and drawers, pull-out baskets, multiple hanging areas, and lighting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Millwork and trim<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Custom millwork and trim are the finishing touches for homes. If yours is a home of architectural significance, custom trim throughout is practically required. But if you want to save money, you can ease back on the fancy millwork in the private areas of the home. Save the ceiling medallions, crown molding, chair rails, dentils, batten, and picture rails for the dining and living areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Basements<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Basement Flooring<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Moisture is usually the deciding factor when you consider <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whether or not to finish your basement<\/a>. Prevalent moisture can turn an expensive basement remodel into an uninhabitable area best used for storage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">An attractive, moisture-shedding floor covering and a subfloor system can make a world of difference. Begin with the subfloor system, interlocking 24-inch squares that elevate your floor covering about 1-inch. Then, choose a basement-ready floor covering that you love, whether ceramic or porcelain tile, luxury vinyl planks, engineered wood flooring, or laminate flooring.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Guest bedrooms<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Building out a guest bedroom in your basement is a wise move when you know that it will get frequent use, either by friends and family or as a rental unit. But if you want a guest bedroom in your basement only for the occasional visitor, you\u2019re taking up valuable space best used for other activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs. Save: Attics<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Built-in storage<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Built-in storage doesn\u2019t often rank high in priority in other parts of the house, but this is not the case for attics. Attics are starved for space to begin with. Once you add furniture, you have even less storage room. Knee walls are the short walls that extend from the floor to the rafters. Knee walls that have built-in storage should be built during the remodeling process, not later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Full bathrooms<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Full bathrooms\u2014toilet, sink, and shower or shower\/tub\u2014are a rarity in attics unless the intent is to build out an entire suite with living quarters. Otherwise, attics used as offices or children\u2019s play areas work well with just a half-bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Splurge vs Save: Decks<\/span><\/h3>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Splurge: Deck Flooring<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Your choice of deck flooring can easily make or break how much you end up using\u2014and loving or avoiding\u2014your deck. With that in mind, you\u2019ll want to prioritize decking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For the best in looks and maximum strength, choose a premium wood such as ipe or mahogany. Both are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and they return maximum resale value. Composite wood\u2014a mixture of wood fibers and plastics\u2014is smooth, splinter-free underfoot, and looks remarkably like wood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Save: Deck Built-ins<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Built-ins such as benches, tables, and planters are wonderful additions to decks. Built-in benches are especially valuable because they tuck away to the side, opening up more space in the center of the deck. Yet one way to pare down your deck-building budget is to save the built-ins for a later day. The same builder (or a different one) can always come back and create those built-ins that your heart desires.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Splurge vs. Save in a Renovation: Conclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Almost every room in a home would gladly use a piece of the budget. Knowing what projects can wait until a later date, or what may or may not maximize the full breadth of the room, can help guide on where to splurge vs. save in your renovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/clean-up-after-major-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimize the mess during a renovation<\/a> and how to clean up after it&#8217;s finished.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
