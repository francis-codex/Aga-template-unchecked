No, it was not finished to our standards but the bones of the house were perfect for us. It is about 2000 sq ft, three bedrooms, a large living room and kitchen, and windows on three side allowing for more light than a standard Brooklyn brownstone. The draw-back was that the last major remodel was done in 1910! That meant all new plumbing, electrical, heating and layout.<\/p>\n<p>The layout included this &#8220;maid&#8217;s&#8221; room only accessible by stairs from the kitchen or through the bathroom. As much as I&#8217;d like a little help now and again I don&#8217;t have a cleaning person let alone a live in maid. The electrical and plumbing work had been redone by the previous owner using, what\u00a0 I assume are all the skills\u00a0 he learned from our local hardware store. The heating was done mostly by wood burning stove in the living room.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-676 mb-10\" title=\"Maids Room Kitchen Wall After\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg\" alt=\"Maids Room Kitchen Wall After\" width=\"540\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg 540w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\">Maid&#8217;s Room 2009, same view as above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The maid&#8217;s room, like the rest of the house, was reworked to keep the character of the house but make it livable for years to come.
