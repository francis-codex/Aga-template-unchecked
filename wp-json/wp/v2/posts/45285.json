That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen.

We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">island would offer storage<\/a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen display ideas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-17-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with natural wood cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45101\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house\u2019s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg\" alt=\"Bertazzoni stove\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-18.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-18-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen storage ideas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45100\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>Balancing the kitchen structures<\/h3>\n<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen\u2019s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn\u2019t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.<\/p>\n<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn\u2019t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house\u2019s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let\u2019s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.<\/p>\n<h3>Odd-ball elements<\/h3>\n<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they\u2019d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink\/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It\u2019s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Amanda-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg\" alt=\"Brown drip dishware\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45099 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room\u2019s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.<\/p>\n<h3>Turning closets into a powder room<\/h3>\n<p>There was <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no bathroom on the first floor<\/a>. We combined two closets\u2014approximately 4\u2019 x 4\u2019\u2014and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.<\/p>\n<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg\" alt=\"wainscot bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45093 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tried-and-true general contractors<\/a> to vet. In the past, we\u2019d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn\u2019t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-4.jpg\" alt=\"powder room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45094 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Amanda-Pantry-9.gif\" alt=\"kitchen pantry with peg hooks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45111\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Veteran renovators share advice<\/h3>\n<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.<\/p>\n<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.<\/p>\n<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It\u2019s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.<\/p>\n<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Amanda and Cory, for sharing your Colonial home remodel story with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation materials<\/h3>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Textile 24&#8243;x24&#8243; floor tile in Sand: <a href=\"https:\/\/cancostileandstone.com\/\">Cancos Tile<\/a>.
