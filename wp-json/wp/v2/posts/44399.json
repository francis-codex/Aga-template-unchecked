But there is another option. Take a look at two or three-flats. Consider a deconversion, where a multi-family building is converted into a multistory, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">single-family home<\/a>. We outline<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> what you should know about making a multi-family your very own. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractors share their insights on what they&#8217;re seeing on the remodeling front.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Avondale, Lincoln Park, Logan Square, Lakeview, and Andersonville there is an abundance of multi-family housing stock, with a price range of just under $500,000 to just under $900,000. Many multi-family homes, typically built between 1900 and 1920, are brick or Greystone, and have two or three stories, with an <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/chicago-condo-remodel-of-a-fixer-upper-new-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment on each floor<\/a>. There&#8217;s often a bay in the front and rear porch with exterior stairs on the back and an unfinished basement or garden apartment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the advantage of deconverting a multi-family home?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The neighborhood is the main attraction. Potential homeowners may already rent there and like it or are attracted to schools, shopping, and the overall architectural \u201cfeel\u201d and mix of a streetscape or area.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What makes a good candidate for deconversion?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, says Sweeten general contractor Ryan, the bones of a two- or three-flat will be good for deconversion, especially in brick construction. Another <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/remodeling-old-house-vintage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advantage is that older buildings<\/a> often have original woodwork, crown moldings, hardwood flooring, and features like fireplaces, in addition to plaster walls.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How long does it take?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six months is an average time frame for deconverting a multi-family home. If there\u2019s a garden apartment, some homeowners opt to live in it <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">during the construction<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s involved and what\u2019s an average cost?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That depends on the condition of the building. If you\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s little to do on the exterior\u2014unless windows or skylights are being added, roof repaired or replaced. In the simplest deconversion, it\u2019s a matter of reconfiguring space, some gutting, rerouting, or adding in new plumbing and electrical. Be sure to work with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the right general contractor<\/a> who is licensed, insured, and up-to-date with local codes and regulations. You&#8217;ll want to meet and compare estimates from at least three <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/chicago-renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractors in your area<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA typical multi-family deconversion project will include opening the first floor, building out a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new kitchen along with its costs<\/a>, replacing the second-<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">floor kitchen with a master suite,\u201d says Ryan. The cost is similar to a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/2020-home-renovation-costs-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole-house remodel<\/a>, so a mid-range two-flat deconversion is around $250,000. But for smaller buildings, say around 2,500 square feet, the work can be done for under $100,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44418 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Chicago-Interior.jpg\" alt=\"multifamily_home_chicago_sweeten\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Chicago-Interior.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Chicago-Interior-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Chicago-Interior-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> (<em>Above<\/em>) Wicker Park deconversion by <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6179#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Ridas<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Opening up the first floor<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard Chicago city lots are 25 by 125 feet. Most two- and three-flats have a load-bearing wall that runs the length of the building, which chops up the layout and minimizes the size of rooms. Removing that wall to maximize space requires shoring up, which can be accomplished by several means, such as sistering floor joists.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s not a disadvantage to scare you off of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-midwest\/renovating-design-trends-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">designing a home<\/a>,\u201d says <span style=\"color: #333333;\">Sweeten contractor Ryan<\/span>. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a significant cost when you\u2019re talking about gaining more living space.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Expanding the kitchen<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you begin the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-midwest\/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">planning for an upgraded kitchen<\/a>, these rooms are in the back in most buildings; so borrowing space from smaller rooms allows for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expansion of the kitchen&#8217;s<\/a> footprint. For example, some old buildings have enclosed back porches that can be opened up. Reorienting and combining spaces usually requires taking walls down to the studs and planning for updated appliances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Reconfiguring the second floor<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a master bedroom suite, which includes a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new or existing bathroom<\/a> and a walk-in closet, is a top priority. There may also be an existing sitting room, which doubles as a family room. One large or two small bedrooms with a bath also suit the plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Moving stairs<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are two separate entries, with two sets of stairs, one obviously needs to go. The other set might be retained\u2014or rebuilt in a new location. Porch or fire stairs on the backside of the structure are often removed. If the foundation is good, that space might be incorporated into the first and second-floor plans. On the first floor, that could mean extra room for the kitchen, or perhaps a breakfast room. On the second level, extra square footage might translate into a master sitting room.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Finishing a basement<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the plan is to make your <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/basement\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basement a living space<\/a>, older buildings typically have a ceiling height under eight feet. However, the ceiling can be raised eight to 10 inches without underpinning; that is, excavating beneath the existing foundation and pouring new footings, which is a necessity when raising a foot or more. This usually is done by lowering the floor down to the footings\u2014which can be as much as 12 inches\u2014then pouring a new concrete floor. Buffing, staining, and polishing that concrete may be a more cost-effective solution than installing high-quality vinyl tile, carpeting, or engineered hardwood.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Toxic materials<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With older buildings, launching into any major alteration can result in unanticipated costs. Sometimes there are happy surprises\u2014like finding beautiful pocket doors that have been buried in walls. But with any structure more than 50 years old, there may be toxic or health-threatening materials that are dangerous when not properly removed. Paint containing lead, for example, needs to be stripped carefully. Asbestos is another material that may be present in pre-1980 insulation and ceiling tiles as well as older linoleum flooring and vinyl tile backings. To remove it requires encapsulation (sealing the surface to prevent fibers from becoming airborne) according to EPA standards.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>HVAC systems<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two or more apartments designed for multiple families, infrastructure is in place. There will be as many heating and\/or cooling systems. Depending on age, they may need to be replaced to improve efficiency. Here are the average lifespans:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furnaces: 15 &#8211; 20 years. Consider two furnaces that are zoned for efficiency and energy savings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central air conditioning units: 10 &#8211; 15 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hot water heaters: 7 &#8211; 10 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tankless water heaters: 20 years<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Upgrading electrical and plumbing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buildings more than 50 years old probably are candidates for upgrading mechanicals. If there\u2019s not already a 200 amp service in place, this is an obvious upgrade. Depending on how high end the project is, and how many electrical systems, devices, smart lighting, and dimmers there are, you might consider a 400 amp service. Even if you didn\u2019t need this much power, planning for the future\u2014with a $3,000-$4,000 additional cost\u2014may be more cost-effective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plumbing may need to be upgraded with the addition of fixtures and new plumbing lines for a second sink or a second-floor tub or shower. New sewer and water systems can range between $15,000 and $25,000 but are necessary when adding fixtures and will also boost pressure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Adding insulation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe try not to touch plaster walls,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cIt\u2019s a big expense. But plaster also is well-insulating in temperature and sound. Spray foam is used in areas where it\u2019s undesirable to remove walls.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Flooring<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Original hardwood flooring can be sanded and re-stained, or damaged boards may be replaced; which is necessary to transition between rooms that have been eliminated. With standard 2 \u00bd inch-wide oak flooring, it\u2019s pretty easy to match. Even maple, sometimes found in older properties, can be matched.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Deconverting a multi-family home into a single home is an undertaking that leads you to even more square footage of living.
