Perhaps you&#8217;re tired of neighbors stomping above you and dealing with your restrictive co-op board, or you are drawn to the dream of owning your very own roof terrace and backyard\u2014aren\u2019t we all? Or maybe you\u2019d also like rental income to offset the cost of home ownership, or you\u2019re an investor looking to maximize rental income.\u00a0 Whatever your motivations, your townhouse renovation search should be narrowed to the properties that will allow you to create the lifestyle you\u2019re looking for. Here are the questions to ask during your search.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4><b>1.) What\u2019s the building\u2019s history?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where you gather information about the soundness of the property. New York City\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/buildings\/index.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Department of Buildings (DOB)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a great site where you can look up the history of the property and see the violations, complaints, as well as applications and permits for prior work done to the property. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for red flags, and use the information to determine whether prior work\u2014especially structural changes or alterations to the plumbing, electrical, and mechanicals\u2014has been executed properly. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.propertyshark.com\/mason\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property Shark<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another place where you can access comprehensive, publicly available information about the property in question.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-kitchen-brown-floor-white-kitchen\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31419 mb-10 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen with brown floor and white kitchen cabinets with recessed lights on ceiling after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>(Above)\u00a0<\/em>AJ and Ray\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">townhouse renovation<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4><b>2.) What\u2019s the actual square footage versus the buildable square footage?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many townhouses are on lots much larger than the current building footprint. For example, brownstones are often on 100-foot lots, but the building itself may only be 20\u2019 x 35\u2019. Chris explains that these properties can often be built back with extensions ranging from ten to 30 feet long, depending on the floor area ratio (FAR). The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/planning\/zoning\/districts-tools\/residence-districts-r1-r10.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAR is determined by the zoning designation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and in New York City, the Zoning Resolution designates ten residential districts. For example, a lot that is 20\u2019 x 100\u2019 in an R7-2 zone that has a FAR of 3.44 allows you to put up a 6,880-square-foot building.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also be able to expand vertically. This is almost always a given, Chris says, although you may be constrained by landmark preservation requirements (see below). Similarly, you should explore excavation possibilities for creating a cellar. While below-grade space is not counted in the square footage, it is often useful to add space below for mechanicals or storage, even if it is not livable. By storing these elements underground, you can free up space above grade to maximize your living space and\/or rental income potential.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-29890 mb-10 size-full\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>(Above)<\/em> Marsha and Adam&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">townhouse renovation<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4><b>3.) What are the existing conditions?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the information that you gather via city databases, pay attention to the existing conditions of the building. Are there signs of water damage, mold, or termites? Also be aware of outside forces beyond an owner\u2019s control\u2014is there a lot of ongoing or planned construction in the area?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If there is an empty lot next door, find out what is happening there. Chris points out that the construction of tunnels for the Second Avenue subway expansion was a major issue for surrounding properties, not only in terms of noise and inconvenience but also with structural damage related to shifting foundations.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it currently a single-family dwelling that you intend to turn into a two-family? Or vice-versa? Be prepared to hire an architect if so.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E1bZ07c4-A0&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40881 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"85\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h4><b>4.) Is the property landmarked or in a historic district?<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/lpc\/about\/about-lpc.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landmark Preservation Commission<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is New York City\u2019s governing agency for preserving buildings and sites that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant. Many brownstone townhouses happen to be in designated historic districts\u2014there are a total of more than 36,000 landmark properties in 141 historic districts and extensions throughout the five boroughs, according to the LPC\u2019s website.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If the townhouse you\u2019re considering is protected, you will need to submit any planned changes to the LPC for review at the same time that you submit plans to the DOB. Chris explains, \u201cAnything that the LPC approves will be approved 99 percent of the time by the DOB. But it\u2019s not the case vice versa.\u201d In particular, any changes to the fa\u00e7ade will be scrutinized by the LPC. For example, while a back extension will not affect the view of the building from the street, adding floors will. If you want to add to the top of the building, you may be required to start 20 feet back from the front of the building, so that the additional floor can\u2019t be seen from the street.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An LPC review will add extra time to your townhouse renovation, so this should be a consideration, especially if you are looking to bring in rental income on a deadline.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32953 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom remodel blue subway tile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Financing Your Townhouse Renovation<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obtaining financing for a townhouse purchase and renovation is essentially the same process as a condo purchase and renovation (co-ops are the outlier here). This is because a townhouse, like a condo, is real property. You can consult <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/financing-home-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this Sweeten guide on financing home renovations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you are financing both the purchase of the property as well as the renovation, you have a few options (Jean advises consulting a professional to see what\u2019s best for your situation).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Apply for a construction loan and a permanent mortgage separately. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means you will need to research two separate loans and pay for two sets of closing costs. Some lenders only provide construction loans, while others will only make combination loans. Construction loans typically run for 12 months or less and are subject to an adjustable interest rate that resets quarterly or sometimes monthly.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><b>OR<\/b><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Apply for a construction-to-permanent loan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This combination instrument simplifies the process because you only need to take out one loan and pay closing costs once. It\u2019s the more popular option for this reason. While construction is ongoing, you only pay interest on the outstanding balance, and then it is converted to a mortgage after the renovation is complete. You may, however, pay more for the permanent mortgage because the need for a combination has reduced your lender options.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25528 mb-10 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse doorway renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><br \/><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>(Above)\u00a0<\/em>Nazli and Larry\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brownstone renovation<\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong>Who You\u2019ll Need On Your Team<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When searching for a townhouse to renovate, it\u2019s important to gather the experts who will not only help you get the job done right, but who can help you assess whether it\u2019s a project worth tackling in the first place. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, you\u2019ll need to line up several professionals early on, including structural engineers, electricians, and plumbers.

Townhouses tend to be multi-floor units with private entrances. Townhouses share one or more walls with adjoining townhouse units; which differentiates them from single-family homes. Townhouse units may have small front or back yards, balcony spaces, or covered porches.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1639150942067\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong>What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse?<\/strong><\/strong>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">A \u201ccondo\u201d (short for condominium) is a style of housing usually located within a community of buildings owned by individuals. A \u201ccondo\u201d community may have shared amenities like a gym, pool, garden, or adhere to rules set by an HOA. A townhouse is a style of home; generally multi-floor with shared walls with other townhouses.
