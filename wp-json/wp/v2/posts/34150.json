Typically installed throughout, wood floors cover a large square footage. It has a substantial impact on your home&#8217;s personality and design style. No surprise, then, the perennial wood floor is often chosen for its unifying qualities and timelessness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, Sweeten renovators show how their hardwood floor ideas added to their home overall. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A herringbone wood floor in Crown Heights<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe style dining area next to the door leading to the roof deck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43646\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/JanetJerry-entryway-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/JanetJerry-entryway-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Janet and Jerry<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> lived on Long Island but bought <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a multi-story fixer-upper in Brooklyn<\/a> as an investment property. Plus, it serves as a place to stay when they work late in the city. They updated the townhouse, keeping the small fourth floor as their own. For their one-bedroom unit, the goal was to create an open, airy studio. One of their pressing challenges was the hardwood floors. They were covered by old vinyl and carpeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">They chose white-oak flooring that would be custom laid in a herringbone pattern. Unfortunately, the lead time was two months just to get the wood custom cut. So, they adjusted their plans and found a pre-cut herringbone wood floor that could be installed quickly. Their quick fix became a beautiful solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Herringbone pattern wood enriches a kitchen<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25566\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Nazli and Larry<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living\/\"><span class=\"s2\">, updating their historic Brooklyn brownstone<\/span><\/a> was a labor of love. They wanted to merge modern and traditional styles. The challenge wa<\/span><span class=\"s1\">s how to do so within the townhouse\u2019s long and narrow dimensions. The couple also struggled between managing their budget and getting their absolute must-haves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, some things Nazli wouldn\u2019t compromise on. One was the wood floors. They wanted to make a statement in the kitchen so they splurged on walnut and installed it as a herringbone pattern. It gives the kitchen a rich, finished look, which extends into the parlor. To stay within budget, they used a less expensive white oak for the upstairs\u2014an area that sees much less traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pro tip: There are a variety of wood floor species\u2014all at varying price points. Oak, maple, and cherry are popular choices as well as bamboo, walnut, ash, and mahogany. Shop around to find the one that fits your budget and style.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Wide-plank wood flooring<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these Sweeten renovators, redoing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their Greenwich Village condo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> included gutting the place and adding a second bedroom. The plan was to maximize their 16-foot ceilings to make the 850-square-foot space larger and more modern. They turned it into a gallery-like space with black steel accents contrasting bright white walls. They kept the finishes simple giving an airiness to the space. One major design detail that achieves this is the contemporary-looking wide-plank wood flooring in a neutral stain. The home became more open, expansive, and refreshed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro tip: By definition, a wide plank is wider than today\u2019s standard 2\u00bd\u2013 to 4\u2013inch boards. And they are believed by many to increase property value due to their current popularity and relatively expensive price.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Wide plank flooring in white oak<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-49428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working from home was the reason for moving into their 1950s home in Los Angeles.

So the 1,538-square-foot house was perfect even if it was in need of a little TLC. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They hired a Sweeten contractor to fix up the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. But first things first. They started by laying down new flooring throughout the house. \u201cWe chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks to showcase the oak\u2019s natural grain and make the house\u2019s interior feel cohesive,\u201d says Amy. And a bonus: The lighter floors compliment the living room\u2019s natural wood ceiling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Classic wood floors in a Westchester County compound<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg\" alt=\"living room with hardwood floors large windows and fireplace and track lights after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51202\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/36758-Shana-House-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/36758-Shana-House-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shana Sandberg of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.revelcraft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revel Craft and Design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came to Sweeten to help <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">renovate her client\u2019s home in Harrison, New York<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The homeowners wanted to turn the 1953 estate into a convenient, multi-generational gathering spot for their family. The home needed an overhaul of the kitchen and bathrooms. The renovation plans also called for a new 750-square-foot addition to act as a large family room. The look of the home is contemporary classic brought together by the beautiful white-oak classic wood floors seen throughout. The homeowners chose variegated coloring to create a sense of refreshed modernity with a nod to the classic.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro tip: Variegated wood coloring and mixed-width patterns add versatility and work well with both classic and contemporary designs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
