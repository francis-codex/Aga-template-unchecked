How do you find a contractor to trust? Who are some of the vetted contractors you could meet? How do you choose timeless materials? <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The culmination of these questions is revealed in our homeowners&#8217; renovation stories\u2014and the questions answered. These homeowners were guided through the renovation process by their Sweeten contractor. Then they graciously shared their new homes and journeys on our blog.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> matches home renovators with vetted general contractors, offering advice, backup, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The best home remodeling tips to get you started<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"kitchen-under-renovation\"  data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen under renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-24166\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1-723x481.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/01_300-Riverside_1-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many moving parts when considering a renovation.

Should you accept a friend referral for a contractor? At Sweeten, we carefully <span class=\"s3\">vet the general contractors<\/span> in our network\u2014each with their own strengths in the types of projects they do. A friend referral won\u2019t check off the most important boxes when looking for the right team. This includes securing multiple bids and knowing whether a contractor is the right one for your specific project. If you&#8217;re considering a friend referral, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/should-you-use-a-friends-general-contractor-for-your-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here&#8217;s more information to know<\/a> before you decide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten also supports you from start to completion.

These entrepreneurs found success in a traditionally male-dominated industry. The job of the general contractor is a complex one. It is a delicate balance of communication and logistics, with many plates spinning at once. \u201cUsing these executive functioning skills, women are great at that,\u201d notes Sweeten\u2019s founder and CEO Jean Brownhill. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/meet-sweeten-contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our blog post series on Sweeten&#8217;s contractors<\/a> who are changing the narrative.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Renewed and remodeled kitchens that inspired us<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-50273 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a kitchen with patterned floor tile and blue cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Jena-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">This <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/a-90-square-foot-manhattan-kitchen-revives-in-color\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s3\">small-space kitchen in a 100-year-old co-op<\/span><\/a> is proof that you can do a lot with a little. While the space measured 90-square-feet, the kitchen proper required compact-sized appliances. Highlighting the value of reassessing a space&#8217;s layout, this Sweeten homeowner was even able to install a small dishwasher for the first time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovating also requires flexibility. While the homeowner had a vision in mind, plans changed when they discovered that plumbing and electrical upgrades were necessary. The budget had to be redirected and materials costs cut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A bold color palette brought her personality into the kitchen: a purple island, blue-and-white floor tile, and cabinets in Brittany Blue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-kitchen-patterened-floor-tiles\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen with patterened floor tiles and golden oak cabinets and butcher block countertop and range hood after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51357 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/plywood-cabinets-moroccan-cement-tile-in-kitchen-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s3\">Chrissy and Matt\u2019s kitchen<\/span><\/a>, their renovation would result in a customized cookspace that was still within budget. Thinking outside the box, they combined a mix of complementary materials. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">They chose plywood cabinet bases for their cost-effectiveness and simple aesthetic look. Natural clay backsplash tile provided texture while a <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Moroccan-patterned cement tile floor would add the graphic pop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A good tip when designing your kitchen cabinets: measure the cookware, small appliances, and tableware you\u2019ll be using. Because the couple was able to customize their cabinet dimensions, they <\/span><span class=\"s5\">took measurements of items such as the height of the coffee grinder and Chemex pitcher, and custom-fit <\/span><span class=\"s5\">exactly where they would be stored.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The right remodeling materials for a big impact<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">When choosing materials, many surfaces and finishes may look similar.

White marble is no doubt on many \u201cmust-have\u201d lists as the look complements every finish, era, and style. But Carrara and Calacatta each have their own nuances\u2014and their own fan clubs.

Each floor would be open-concept, so walls, bricks, and joists would be removed. It was a major investment and alteration, with added complexity: nothing existing was good enough to keep. To tackle this complete gut, they found the right professional renovation team to help them through the process from start to finish. An architect and a Sweeten design-build firm recreated a live\/work home. New features included radiant-heated floors, a custom kitchen, and a relocated building entrance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;Throughout the job, we enjoyed a collaborative exchange with the architect and contractor,&#8221; said Steve and Lewis. &#8220;As first-time (and last!) renovators, we\u2019d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had chosen our team carefully.&#8221; Looking back, they share this advice, &#8220;<span>Issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in.
