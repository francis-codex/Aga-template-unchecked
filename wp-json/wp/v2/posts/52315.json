We made the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first round of renovations<\/a> out of sheer necessity after buying the house with a long list of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">structural and systemic issues<\/a>. The experience of trying to line up dependable contractors had been stressful\u2014even getting quotes. We\u2019d hired the one contractor we could pin down. It was that experience that prompted us to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">work with Sweeten<\/a> this time around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg\" alt=\"Natural toned garage living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-14-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg\" alt=\"Garage work space and orange leather couch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We renovated the garage when we did because we planned to sell the house. But working from home during Covid made us realize that room to spread out would benefit us while we still lived there. We posted our project and waited to see <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ca\/los-angeles-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which contractors were interested<\/a> in taking on a garage remodel in Los Angeles.<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Inspecting the garage&#8217;s structure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The job wouldn\u2019t be easy. We needed to solve the garage\u2019s long-standing structural issues. The building was more than 80 years old; the roof had begun to sag and we were unsure of the extent of the damage. Perhaps the job would involve replacing the ceiling\u2019s support beams and installing a new door. Or it might require an entire rebuild. We needed someone to inspect the structure and advise us of what was needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Luckily, that wasn\u2019t as difficult as we anticipated. The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractor we chose determined that the original beams had been too narrow, and spaced too far apart, to fully support the garage\u2019s ceiling. He also informed us that the two existing single-car garage doors were rotting away and termite-ridden. Our biggest question was, \u201cDo we have enough money\u201d to fix the problems? Turned out the answer was yes, and then some!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"garage-to-living-with-concrete-floors\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-07.jpg\" alt=\"garage converted into a living space with storage cabinets and wooden ceiling with beams and white walls and window and concrete floors after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-07-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg\" alt=\"Garage white cabinets with television\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Creating a new living\/working space in the garage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We had several goals beyond shoring up the garage. First, we wanted to replace the existing two one-car garage doors with a fully automated two-car door. Second, we needed to install a new outlet for plugging in our electric car charger. Finally, we sought to create a space that would be more than a storage area\u2014as comfortable as our living room, but (because local building codes required it) still functional as a garage. No layout changes would be necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We decided to give the space the look of a loft. We envisioned exposed wood beams lining the ceilings, crisp white walls, and a lot of natural light. In keeping with that aesthetic, we <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used a lot of the existing materials<\/a>, including the wood ceiling beams (they are the actual structural supports that already existed with some additional wood reinforcing them) and the original concrete slab floor (we filled in cracks with a special cement caulk and painted it gray).<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Custom doors for a small space<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One big challenge was the garage door. We have discovered that with a small house comes the joy of everything being undersized and therefore not standard. Doors and windows had needed customization, and the garage door was no different\u2014it was narrower than the norm. In addition, we discovered that the garage floor sloped, necessitating a custom panel on the bottom of the door that sloped side-to-side with the floor, ensuring a weatherproof seal. The panel, though surprisingly expensive, has been worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The walls offered no straight lines, either, but our drywall installer was a true artist. The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years. There wasn\u2019t a single straight, vertical wall, and some bowed or curved. The cabinets<\/span><span class=\"s9\">\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">provided a good deal of storage and brought a domestic air to what might otherwise just feel like a garage. The countertop is an unfinished pine board and is, like the ceiling, a little rustic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg\" alt=\"natural toned garage living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"Blue garage with closed door\" width=\"1000\" height=\"618\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-52359 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-600x371.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">The right contractor for a garage remodel in Los Angeles<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Our Sweeten contractor had a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clear communication style<\/a> and was immensely helpful throughout the process. We could always count on him to respond promptly when we sent him a text or email. More often than not he\u2019d call us back to talk via phone, which I appreciated. He kept us informed of when the subcontractors were going to be working and who specifically would be at our house. And best of all, he stayed on budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our contractor was so good that we didn\u2019t need Sweeten&#8217;s support too much.

Even though the garage is now a living space, we also needed to make sure there were attractive places to store things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thanks for sharing your new garage renovation story with us, Saima and Tom!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovation Materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s10\">GARAGE RESOURCES: Garage doors: <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.garagedoor4less.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garage Doors and Gates 4 Less<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s10\">Windows: <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdsupplyhis.com\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HD Supply<\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s10\">Paint in Chantilly Lace: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s11\">Benjamin Moore<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Sektion base cabinets with Haggeby doors; Nydala pulls in black; paper lantern with light kit l<span class=\"s10\">ight fixture<\/span>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ikea<\/a>.
