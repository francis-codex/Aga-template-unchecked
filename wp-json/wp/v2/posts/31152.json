It had everything I had been looking for\u2014two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/flooring-options-and-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">putting in new hardwood floors<\/a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question\u2014and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn\u2019t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn\u2019t exactly scream a clear solution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31285 size-feature\" title=\"happy-homeowner-renovated-kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait-936x667.jpg\" alt=\"happy homeowner in a renovated kitchen\" width=\"936\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, \u201cbrilliant\u201d plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an island, then a peninsula<\/a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn\u2019t) working for the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31161 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif\" alt=\"blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04.jpg\" alt=\"integrated cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31160 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen04-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg\" alt=\"blue cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31162 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the \u201centry,\u201d but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-31159\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg\" alt=\"dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Adding a drop ceiling<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I\u2019ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31166 size-full\" title=\"kitchen sink\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen remodel Brooklyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen16-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31165 size-full\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen remodel Brooklyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Two prep zones<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and\u00a0keep it close to the cooktop\/oven. By doing this, I <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thekitchn.com\/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">created two zones for prep<\/a> on each side of the sink.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop\/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop\/oven,\u00a0and the refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers\u00a0earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg\" alt=\"living room renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31169 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on the way my apartment \u201cboundaries\u201d were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design,\u00a0there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and \u201copen\u201d storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a \u201cpiano\u201d finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I\u2019m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01.jpg\" alt=\"pendant lighting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31168 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg\" alt=\"dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31170 \" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Consider all possibilities<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I optimistically planned for a \u201cquick\u201d two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<h3>Brighter and more functional home<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Renovating my own space as an architect<\/a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I\u2019m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,\u00a0 and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they\u2019re coming for dinner.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Lauren, for sharing your Brooklyn Heights kitchen remodel story with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Materials<\/h3>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Cabinets: Custom.
