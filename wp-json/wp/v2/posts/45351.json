While renovating a condo is usually a more limited proposition than renovating a house, Sweeten offers guidelines on a few special considerations you\u2019ll need to take into account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First,<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0you will need to obtain the proper city and building approvals before beginning your project. Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6622#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miami contractor Sandra<\/a>, who is based in Miami, tells us, \u201cThe typical process takes about 4-8 weeks for a mid-sized project. [Usually,] the office management has pretty much the same requirements as the city.\u201d You must apply first to the city, and once the city approves the permit, the information is submitted to the management office for the condo. The most common permits required in a condo remodeling Miami project are <\/span><span class=\"s1\">floor soundproofing, plumbing, electrical, and framing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Building requirements\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In addition to obtaining city permits, many new building projects must also meet new building requirements. You must usually meet and comply with regulations around work hours, rubbish removal, gas installation, and more. Licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/miami-renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractors in Miami<\/a> with experience would be able to navigate any building paperwork and restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything you should be mindful of during your project:<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">1) Working hours<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">These are more limited than in a free-standing house. Typically, buildings will permit workers access between the hours of 9AM &#8211; 4PM (occasionally, until 5pm) on weekdays. This translates into shorter working hours. As a result, a condo renovation may take longer than that same project in a house.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">2) Prepping common areas<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">Buildings will require workers to protect the common lobby, hallways, and elevators. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Just note, this can keep the GC from working on the actual project on any given day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">3) Rubbish removal<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">As in all large buildings, trash removal presents a bigger obstacle than in a free-standing house. As Miami-based Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6382#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miami contractor Adrian<\/a> explains, due to the more protracted process, \u201cthe cost of removing the trash is much higher in a condo than in a single-family home.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost for a\u00a0trash removal service is based on the number of \u201cpulls\u201d it takes to remove debris. According to Adrian\u2019s experience, to remove and replace floor tile in a 1,000-square-foot condo, he estimates it would require four pulls (2-3 for old tile, and one pull for new tile waste). The cost would be around $3,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten contractor Sandra concurs: \u201cWe spend a lot of time doing this and do it on a daily basis. That means we need to reserve the elevator every time we have to bring it down. We cannot use the building dumpster, so we need to put it in our truck and haul it away.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">4) Altering the slab<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">Since even the oldest Miami condos date only back to the \u201850s and \u201860s, they are largely concrete structures. Sweeten contractor Sandra explains, \u201cIt is possible but very complex. We would need a structural engineer affidavit and structural plans.\u201d Management will likely be strict about this aspect of the renovation. After all, altering the slab can affect the building&#8217;s other units. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s1\">Technically, it is possible to trench or drill to lay plumbing or electrical. However, you would need to prove that you will not compromise the integrity of the slab. Oftentimes, buildings will require \u201cscanning\u201d (via a professional vendor) of the area where the proposed alteration will occur. Sweeten contractor Adrian estimates that it usually costs approximately $600 to scan 100-200 square feet. <\/span>\u201cIf you are going to core drill, the building may not require an engineer to sign off on the alteration,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cBut if you are going to trench along the slab then they most certainly will.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">5) Gas<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s4\">Most Miami condos feature electric stoves and dryers. That said, gas stoves are becoming slightly more common in new luxury buildings. Our Sweeten contractors do not know of buildings that permit gas dryers. If your condo unit does not currently have a washer\/dryer in-unit, there\u2019s a 50\/50 chance that it\u2019ll be permitted. Again, this is up to your management company\u2019s rules.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">6) Windows<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s4\"> Due to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the seasonal hurricanes<\/a>, building codes require impact windows. Luckily, this isn\u2019t the responsibility of the individual renovator because windows are typically a building-wide project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">7) Fees<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span class=\"s4\">Lastly, expect the management company to charge you a fee for renovating your condo. Just note, these fees are paid in addition to any permit and approval charges. These fees aren&#8217;t unique to Miami, this is standard in condos across the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, you should have a sense of what to look out for in your Miami condo renovation. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to\u00a0<span class=\"s2\">renovate with the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best general contractors in Miami<\/a><\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries<\/i>: If you\u2019re on a tight timeline,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jdoqocy.com\/click-100545793-15162279\"><span class=\"s1\">Appliances Connection<\/span><\/a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
