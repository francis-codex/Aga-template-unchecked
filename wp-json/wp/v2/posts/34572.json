It can be tricky if you are updating a kitchen or bathroom. Living without some elements will make surviving a renovation tough (running water, electricity, Wi-Fi), so moving out while work is being done is probably your best option. But if the renovation won&#8217;t affect your needs in a major way, then you might be able to stay.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> <span class=\"s1\">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Here are <\/span>six Sweeten homeowners who moved out\u2014or stuck it out\u2014during their renovation.<\/p>\n<h3>Moving out during demolition<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-industrial-stairs-living-room\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44895 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Carly-living-room-3.jpg\" alt=\"black industrial stairs leading to a living room with orange couch after renovation\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> (<em>Above<\/em>) Carly&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/studio-loft-balcony-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new apartment<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carly had been looking\u2014and saving\u2014for years to buy an apartment of her dreams. So when she found this 500-square-foot co-op in Greenwich Village, she snapped it up. It was a studio with a\u00a0 lofted bedroom and balcony\u2014what more could she ask? It did need work, however. She wanted to literally raise the roof in order to enclose the loft bedroom and redo the kitchen. The entire renovation took five months. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the interest of surviving her renovation, Carly decided to move out during the messiest part of the process: the demolition and raising the roof.\u00a0 &#8220;For much of it, though, I was there,&#8221; said Carly. &#8220;I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases.&#8221; But she doesn&#8217;t regret &#8220;slumming it.&#8221; &#8220;The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Airbnb-hopping<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33695 mb-10 size-chrono\" title=\"brown-wooden-floor-breakfast-nook\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"brown wooden floor for breakfast nook and living room with blue wall separator after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"><\/a><span class=\"img-label\"> (<em>Above<\/em>) Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apartment combination<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/combining-apartments-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Combining their apartment<\/a> with the unit next door eliminated the option of living at home when work began. Since the scope of work extended beyond demolishing walls and the two existing kitchens to build a new one,\u00a0 Zoe and Arvid moved into a short-term sublet. The couple embarked on an Airbnb-hopping adventure when their lease ended before the work was done.

They previously had remodeled their kitchen but were wary of redoing their bathroom. The couple only has one in their apartment so they thought it being out of commission would be tough. Sharon and Laurence ultimately decided to stay in the apartment during the renovation. It wasn&#8217;t ideal but they used a neighbor\u2019s apartment for bathroom access. Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Moving into a rental<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"large-minimalistic-living-room\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44897 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"large minimalistic living room with black framed glass door and two large windows after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Jessica-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Jessica-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\">(<em>Above<\/em>) The light-filled renovated <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">living room<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For their family of five, these homeowners wanted an open and airy space.
