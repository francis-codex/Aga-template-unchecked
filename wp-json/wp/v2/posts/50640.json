Here are our tips for setting expectations\u2014the key to happy clients and great reviews.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/general-contractor-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Be upfront and transparent about how you work<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Explain early that you have <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crews working on multiple jobs<\/a>, and that it\u2019s normal, say, for the electrician to run off to work on a different project. And that it\u2019s normal for there to be hours\u2014or even days\u2014when there are no workers on site. Explain that some work may have to wait for materials to be delivered, or for adhesives to dry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Make it clear that circumstances often force schedule changes. Then let clients know ASAP any time there\u2019s a delay or if work has to pause. An informed client is a happier client.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Be patient and open-minded during client conversations<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Remember that your client has probably never done this before. Questions that could seem insulting often just come from a lack of understanding about construction, or anxieties about their home being jackhammered. Please don\u2019t take these questions personally! Answer as patiently and clearly as possible.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Tips for Emerging Contracting Firms<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">If <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/what-types-of-general-contractors-does-sweeten-work-with\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you\u2019re new to Sweeten<\/a>, you might feel tempted to bend over backward to make clients happy. We\u2019ve seen GCs perform work outside of scope without creating a change order, etc.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t go crazy\u2014you\u2019re a business, and you need to treat clients as clients.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Stepping outside the bounds of the contractor-client relationship can lose money for you, and can create false expectations. Clients who think you\u2019re a friend doing them a favor can feel betrayed when you start acting like a business!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Tips for Established Contracting Firms<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Be patient and clear when explaining why you can\u2019t comply with a request. If it\u2019s a technical or a code restraint, the client will be much more satisfied if they understand. Don\u2019t let them think you\u2019re just inflexible. You might be able to work together to find a compromise.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Remember your Sweeten Account Manager<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">If you\u2019re having trouble communicating something to a client, talk to us!
