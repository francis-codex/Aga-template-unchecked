The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless\u2014sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.<\/p>\n<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn\u2019t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner.<\/p>\n<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project<\/h3>\n<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3730\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Sweeten general contractor<\/a> in Philadelphia.<\/p>\n<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Like all home renovation projects, it\u2019s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6576#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor<\/a> in the Miami area.<\/p>\n<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3191#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Santi<\/a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.<\/p>\n<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling<\/em>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost vs Value<\/a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home\u2019s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.<\/p>\n<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen<\/h3>\n<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your general contractor can likely assist<\/a> you with the design.<\/p>\n<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the \u201cwork triangle\u201d for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">existing decks will need to be assessed<\/a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"stone-counter-granite-countertop\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg\" alt=\"stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> (<em>Above<\/em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4277#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor John<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens<\/h3>\n<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench\u2014a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances\u2014is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to cabinets, don\u2019t install too many as you\u2019re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.<\/p>\n<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances<\/h3>\n<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you\u2019re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don\u2019t hold back on price, Dennis advised. \u201cYou want to make sure you have a quality grill\u2014and fridge\u2014because if they break you aren\u2019t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. \u201cSome fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,\u201d Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.\u00a0 But don\u2019t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens<\/h3>\n<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens\u2014such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system\u2014Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There\u2019s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.<\/p>\n<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens<\/h3>\n<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.<\/p>\n<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you\u2019re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.<\/p>\n<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen<\/h3>\n<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but \u201cif a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the waste water into the ground,\u201d said Jose, \u201cIt needs to be connected back into the house\u2019s sewer.\u201d Use of a <a href=\"https:\/\/homesteady.com\/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dry well,<\/a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.<\/p>\n<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits<\/h3>\n<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don\u2019t want to use gas tank lighting, you\u2019ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.<\/p>\n<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. \u201cIt would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,\u201d Dennis said.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to turn your outdoor space into a hub of outdoor entertainment?\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Start getting matched<\/a> with your ideal Sweeten general contractor today!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">ADUs or <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu\/\"><span class=\"s2\">accessory dwelling units can transform<\/span><\/a> into home offices, living space for family or as a rental, or a retreat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
