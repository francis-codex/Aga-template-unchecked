Firm principal Bryan Young (photographed above) launched his practice in 2010, and in just 3 years, the small team has rallied some big achievements, including last month&#8217;s award of the <a href=\"https:\/\/archleague.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013 Architectural League Prize<\/a>.\u00a0In practice, the team pursues unique considerations of materiality, assembly, &amp; craft\u00a0through a method of experimentation that\u00a0embraces\u00a0all levels of technology; the resulting architecture, while stylistically modern, elicits qualities of\u00a0warmth &amp; tactility. We were interested in learning more about Young Projects&#8217; work, so we met up with Bryan on the site of a project that is currently under construction in Williamsburg, the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/portfolios\/Gut-Renovation\/Photographer-s-Townhouse-Williamsburg-Brooklyn-NY\/602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"graphic-rendering-of-two-storey-house\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48042 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg\" alt=\"3d graphic rendering of a two storey house backyard with swimming pool before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse project is a gut renovation &amp; new addition to an existing, 2,300 sqft masonry\u00a0townhouse. The century-old building had deteriorated to a state of disrepair before it was purchased by a local photographer. After a thoughtful collaboration between the Young Projects team and the homeowner, the first phase of construction began earlier this year. On site, Bryan walked us through some of the highlights of the project design and development. One of the most prominent features of the new design is the exterior; by their use of materials, the designers have created a strong juxaposition between the old, restored brick facade, and the new addition &#8212; an elevated mass behind a screen of perforated, corrugated zinc. You can see the exterior in the above rendering.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"2d-design-rendering\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48038\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg\" alt=\"2d design rendering of a two storey-house\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This section drawing gave us an idea of the proposed interior space. Unlike the sharp contrast on the exterior, the distinction between old and new is more subtle on the interior &#8212; a &#8216;conceptual fault line&#8217; creates a slip in the floor level at the intersection of the old &amp; new zones. On a functional level, by elevating the addition, the designers provide space for parking. With this arrangement, the back yard is replaced by a series of rooftop courtyards that will allow the perfect amount of privacy on the corner lot.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"room-during-renovation\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48041 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg\" alt=\"photo of a room with beams during renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here, on site, we&#8217;re standing near the center of the old townhouse looking toward the back where the new addition will be constructed.

Here you can see the changes in the floor height, indicating where the new addition begins. Opposite what we saw on the exterior, the designers have created continuity across the slip with the conscious use of materials, so that on the interior, we read the old &amp; new as a fluid space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"townhouse-exterior-during-renovation\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48044 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg\" alt=\"three storey townhouse exterior during renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the old masonry building, the construction crew started prepping the foundation for the new addition.
