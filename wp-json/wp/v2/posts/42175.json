The survey of past, current, and future renovators across seven major U.S. cities gave us insight into what makes renovators\u2019 hearts race\u2014not in a good way\u2014and how they approach a major project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, seeing that 85% of homeowners consider remodeling stressful is not a shocker (though the fact that Los Angeles homeowners top the list of saying it\u2019s \u201cextremely stressful\u201d was of note). Below are just some of the highlights from a hefty report that includes interesting geographical differences. We read every word to problem-solve and make the process as transparent as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Planning is the most stressful stage.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, even more than demolition or relocation. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed placed planning in their top three most stressful renovation steps. The good news? Our blog has plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/category\/renovation-101\/\"><span class=\"s2\">guides on pricing, timing, and other must-knows<\/span><\/a> to make renovation easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47779\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-1-300x120.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-1-600x240.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>2.<\/strong><b> Going over budget is a top concern<span>\u2014<\/span><\/b><b>but most people don\u2019t do that.<br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not so surprising, but important nonetheless. Of those who said they went over budget, the majority actually only spent 10% more than they\u2019d budgeted, so even though missing the money mark is a big-time fear, the amount overspent is less than you\u2019d think. We actually advise renovators to build in a 10% cushion to the budget on all projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">NOTE: When you post a project on Sweeten, our platform pre-populates the various elements involved and pricing down to every last detail, from cabinet installation to floor replacement, providing a much simpler way to look at the big picture (and granular) costs. Our platform also provides a bid-leveling service to compare contractor estimates for an apples-to-apples analysis to make the smartest decision for what you\u2019re trying to accomplish.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>3.<\/strong> <b>Renovation shows and videos are a major learning source.<\/b>\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While a renovation is really not like what you see on a 30-minute TV show, 57% of survey participants watch homes transform on TV and\/or the Internet. Our advice? Get inspiration and ideas, get a sense of what a post-demolition space looks like\u2014but don\u2019t make assumptions about how your own project or experience will turn out based on the made-for-screen remodels. (You don\u2019t REALLY believe you can overhaul your living space in 48 hours, right?)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>4.<\/strong> <b>Men are more trusting; women need a call.<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When it comes to general contractors (GCs), men have a higher overall opinion of them (68% vs. 62%). Women place the highest importance on contractors returning calls quickly (67% to 58%) and are most often deterred by a contractor who\u2019s difficult to get ahold of (67% to 58%).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At Sweeten, we agree that communication and chemistry are key!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47783\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-2-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-2-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-2-1-600x300.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.<\/strong> <strong>Where you live affects what you worry about.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Check out our map below!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47781\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"940\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-3-300x282.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Stats-3-600x564.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dream homes are universal and renovators have similar questions and concerns across various cities nationwide\u2014some might even be ones you have now. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> is a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors.
