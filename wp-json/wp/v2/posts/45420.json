This allows the replacement of cabinets and countertops from big-box stores, a stocked appliance package, and tile flooring.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For a mid-grade kitchen, expect starting costs between <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><strong>$30,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$40,000<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"s1\">.

This works out to be <strong>$340<\/strong> psf. About 60 percent of the cost is recouped in the value it adds to your home. With a budget of this amount, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with countertops, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also allows the addition of a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Other than<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\"><span class=\"s2\"> adding a kitchen island<\/span><\/a>, the layout, such as where the oven and dishwasher are installed, must remain the same as the original design.

The psf cost is <strong>$675<\/strong>. This project can add 58 percent of the budget to your home\u2019s value. A high-end kitchen remodel can consist of custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported ceramic or glass tile backsplashes. The appliances would also kick up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood.

For this price,\u00a0 you can remodel a 35-square-foot bathroom. It includes adding a porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.

Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding square footage to your DC home\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enlarging living space to an existing floor plan starts at <strong>$120<\/strong> psf and can easily go up to <strong>$20<\/strong>0 psf. The most economical addition is adding square footage over a crawl space. An extension where you are adding or adjusting the foundations will come in around <strong>$150<\/strong> psf.

The Council of the District of Columbia issues building permits for this area. Permits cost two percent of the budget for work over <strong>$1,000<\/strong>.
