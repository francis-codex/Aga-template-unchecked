Envisioning the kitchen as the heart of the home, Cody designed a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">six-foot-long island<\/a> as a place for the family to gather around. He also combined a few closets in the living room into one, large closet to make better use of the space. \u201cWe felt most comfortable with our general contractor from day one,\u201d Marissa said, \u201cHe and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication.

No problem!<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As an architect, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/general-contractors-dream-apartment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ana<\/a> developed the plans for her 2-bed, 2-bath apartment and met with several contractors on her own. She was ready to hire one of the general contractors until a background check led to the shocking conclusion that their office address was an empty storefront. Rather than start a new search from scratch, Ana came to Sweeten. The renovation&#8217;s most impactful update was opening up the office\/guest bedroom to connect it to the living room and installing <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom sliding panels<\/a> that could be used to close off the space whenever privacy was needed. Many of the professionals Ana spoke to said that the sliding panels couldn\u2019t be done because of the oversized dimensions, which would make them too heavy, but their Sweeten contractor took on the challenge and executed them beautifully.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg\" alt=\"architect contractor relationship\" width=\"723\" height=\"483\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A tight renovation timeline for a baby on the way<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tina was eager to customize her new home (see <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">part 2<\/a> of her renovation), but with a fixed deadline fast approaching\u2014the birth of her first child\u2014she needed to\u00a0act quickly. To personalize the space, she planned to open up the kitchen, re-tile bathrooms, refinish flooring, add molding\/casing, and replace interior doors. \u201cThanks to our Sweeten contractor and his crew, the renovation process was relatively quick and painless. By having the design decisions completed before work began, we eliminated on-the-go decision-making and were able to work with the team and budget effectively,\u201d Tina said. Her contractor was considerate of the tight <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">timeline<\/a>, and despite minor delays,\u00a0the job wrapped just in time for the couple to schedule their move-in a week before the baby\u2019s due date.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-21436 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"architect contractor relationship\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>A couple and contractor teamed up to tackle a kitchen remodel<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking to renovate their newly-purchased fixer-upper, architect couple <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kate and Arthur<\/a>\u00a0called upon Sweeten to\u00a0enlist their team. \u201cArthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don\u2019t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation\u2014we needed help finding someone!\u201d Kate said. While the contractor\u2019s team handled the major work\u2014installing wood floors, tiling, lighting, and appliances in the kitchen and bath, as well as removing the built-in loft in the bedroom\u2014Kate and Arthur chose to paint and assemble the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IKEA cabinets<\/a> in the kitchen (a decision that Kate does\u00a0NOT recommend for future renovators). The outcome was well worth the effort. \u201cWe are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it\u2019s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn\u2019t have done it without our Sweeten contractor,\u201d said Kate.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_BradCApt-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30463 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_BradCApt-06-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"architect contractor relationship\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Custom red, glossy bathroom cabinets come to life<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After experiencing water damage in their home for the third time, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/homeowner-guest-post-brad-and-michelles-modern-fort-greene-apartment-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad and Michelle<\/a> needed to provide realistic estimates that could be used to challenge his insurer\u2019s predictably low ones. Sweeten helped Brad, an architect, find a general contractor who understood the situation completely. While the couple took a week-long vacation, their contractor got to work on gut-renovating their bathroom. Expanding <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage<\/a> in the bath became a challenge when they discovered that the existing glossy red IKEA cabinets had been discontinued. Taking matters into his own hands, Brad designed new ones and worked with Sweeten to find a millworker to execute his vision. Once the cabinets were ready, his Sweeten contractor took care of the installation.<\/p>\n<h4>Ready to find the right general contractor for your remodel?<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46413\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post a Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Want to see the renovation process broken down step by step?\u00a0Check out our remodeling guides for the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bath<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
