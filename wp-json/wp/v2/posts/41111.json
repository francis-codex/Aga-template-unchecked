Homeowners come to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> to find a general contractor who can reimagine their homes and sometimes bring along an interior designer who can help them visualize the new space. Other times, interior designers come directly to Sweeten to hire a general contractor for their clients\u2019 projects. How a designer and contractor work together on a project varies case-by-case, sometimes they\u2019re involved from the get-go, and other times a designer will come in post-construction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGeneral contractors are essential to our work,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nysid.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NYSID<\/a> faculty member Harry Heissmann. \u201cWhile we can dream up and lay out rooms and houses, we need help executing our vision and while all of us are perfectly capable of supervising a job, the GC takes a lot of pressure off and organizes the different trades on a job according to a schedule.
