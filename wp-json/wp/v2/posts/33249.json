In the\u00a0document, your board lays out all of the rules and guidelines for renovating in your building to ensure there is minimum disruption to your neighbors while a renovation is in progress. This\u00a0can include\u00a0rules on\u00a0the allowable work hours (to limit noise) and when the freight elevator will be open for deliveries or materials. When you&#8217;re buying, or if you&#8217;re thinking about renovating in a co-op or condo, you should read your alteration agreement immediately before talking to a general contractor; you&#8217;ll need to share\u00a0those guidelines right from the start.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another important piece of information usually found in the agreement is how much insurance your building requires.\u00a0This amount is usually from $1 million to $3 million,\u00a0which you&#8217;ll want to relay to any contractors you&#8217;re\u00a0speaking with in order to make sure that they have that coverage in place before they even step foot inside your home. If you <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post your project on Sweeten<\/a> and include this\u00a0amount in your profile, Sweeten will make sure to only match you to contractors who can cover the requirement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have more questions on the topic, check out our\u00a0blog post\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Renovating?
