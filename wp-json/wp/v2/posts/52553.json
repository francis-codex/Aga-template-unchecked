A three-bedroom fixer-upper, we chose it knowing we could renovate it to our exact specifications. The unit had, curiously, two front doors, neither of which was in a logical location, and we wanted to find a solution to that problem. We needed to renovate the two <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bathrooms<\/a>, which had been largely untouched for decades. And finally, we wanted to redo the living-room fireplace fa\u00e7ade as a finishing touch to our renovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg\" alt=\"Living area with window alcove and fireplace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">The apartment is a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full-floor unit<\/a> in a three-flat building; it\u2019s around 1,575 square feet and has a 160-square-foot rear deck. We have two French bulldogs and wanted the condominium for its generous size, but we also appreciated its historic status and original character. We\u2019d noticed that historic properties often had their period aspects stripped out. We wanted to bring modern updates to the space, maintain its vintage features, and incorporate mid-century touches into our design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">We\u2019d recently completed a challenging remodel of the condominium\u2019s kitchen, and felt we needed a new contractor to tackle the next phase. We posted our project on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, fielded responses, and soon found a contractor we believed was well-matched to the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">Solving an odd problem: two front doors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">Moving our home\u2019s entrance door was perhaps the change that required the most thought. Originally, the apartment had two front doors! One went into the living room, and the other opened into the smallest of our three bedrooms, which we think was the housekeeper\u2019s room at some point. Door No. 1 limited the wall space in our relaxing and entertaining room. Door No. 2 made that tiny bedroom even smaller and less functional.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg\" alt=\"Entryway leading into the dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><span class=\"s8\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\">Initially, we\u2019d decided to make the door to the small bedroom our primary front door, converting that room to a foyer. We\u2019d tear out the door leading to the living room and drywall over it. This approach would have required only a slight expansion of the width of that door opening to the bedroom, and replacing trim in a couple of spots. But in the end, we decided the quick fix wasn\u2019t the best option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s8\">Remodeling a new apartment entry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>After discussing it with our Sweeten contractor, we decided on a plan to create yet a third door. We would close off the two original entry doors and move the apartment\u2019s front door to a new location in the dining room. These changes would give us full walls in both rooms. Closing Door No. 1 ultimately allowed for a friendlier, more functional furniture arrangement in the living room. Eliminating Door No. 2 created space for us to install a large storage system comprising a Murphy bed and a desk in the former housekeeper\u2019s room. Two absolute wins.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Bed.gif\" alt=\"Gif of the murphy bed closing and transforming into a desk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52415\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s8\">Now our apartment needed an entirely new entry. For the new opening, we chose a modern front door that contrasts with the vintage character of the dining and living rooms within. We\u2019re particularly happy about the contrast between \u201cnew and old\u201d as you enter our home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">Two black-and-white bathroom upgrades<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s9\">Next, we moved on to updating the two <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/bathroom-renovations\/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s8\">small <\/span><span class=\"s9\">bathrooms<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s8\">. We wanted to update the plumbing, tiling, and fixtures, plus add exhaust fans to both baths. We planned to source and provide all fixtures, including a bathtub, faucets, lighting, fans, and more. To stay on budget, we asked our contractor to provide only the rough materials and labor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with white tiles, black tiled floor, and glass paneled shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-16-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"s8\">&#8220;We found Sweeten\u2019s detailed contractor reviews helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">Aiming for a clean aesthetic consistent with our just-completed kitchen, we chose to tile every wall surface from <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ideas-and-inspiration\/white-subway-tile-bathroom-7-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">floor to ceiling with white subway tile<\/a>. We\u2019re pleased with the way this brings attention to our 10-foot ceilings. We chose similarly timeless black marble hex tile for the floors, hoping it would conceal dirt, hair, and other buildups between regular cleanings. Finally, we indulged our love of mid-century furniture, integrating matching bathroom vanities of that era\u2019s style.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with white subway tile and matte black fixtures\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52411\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-15-600x398.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with white subway tile and small wooden vanity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1555\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-193x300.jpg 193w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-14-579x900.jpg 579w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\">Achieving a sleek subway tile fireplace<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s8\">The last idea we wanted to implement was in the living room, where we\u2019d decided to add decorative subway tile around the original fireplace. When we purchased the apartment, the walls around the firebox were drywalled; <\/span><span class=\"s9\">we wanted to reclaim the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fireplace\u2019s role as a focal point<\/a> for the living space. We chose a glossy white subway tile for the new fireplace fa\u00e7ade to brighten the space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">The key to finding the right general contractor in Chicago<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s8\">Everything went remarkably smooth with the string of projects. Our Sweeten contractor was professional and provided clear <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">advice on issues big and small<\/a>, including the placement of fixtures, the color of the grout, and more. We leaned heavily on our contractor\u2019s expertise. We experienced no real challenges\u2014this was in contrast to our experience during other phases of our broader renovation, with different contractors. We\u2019ve renovated before, and we know: The wrong contractor can add unnecessary stress, delays, and cost. The right contractor can make the process relatively painless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg\" alt=\"White tiled fireplace with decorative clock above\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of the home in Chicago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1472\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52413\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-204x300.jpg 204w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96250-Stephen-Apt-17-600x883.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">We found Sweeten\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovators-reviews\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detailed contractor reviews<\/a> helpful, and credit those in part for our successful hire.
