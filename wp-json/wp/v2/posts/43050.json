Knowing <span>how to add a home addition in Los Angeles <\/span>means growing families have an option of not moving into a different, bigger home. And it doesn\u2019t impinge on your yard space!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s no doubt that adding another story is a big undertaking, both financially and in terms of its timeline. It\u2019s also likely that the renovation will force you to relocate (at least for part of the project.) But to balance that out, it can add a lot of value to your home. Also, many homeowners find it worthwhile to consider a long-wanted first-floor renovation as well. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Here, we outline the ins and outs of adding a second-story addition to your home.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><em>(Photo above) Second-story build in Los Angeles by Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5891#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general contractor Cecille\u00a0<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How long do second-story additions take?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A typical second story that includes a least a bedroom and a bathroom takes at least three to five months, according to Los Angeles-based <span class=\"s2\">Sweeten <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5830#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">contractor Tami<\/span><\/a>. Many elements can increase that time including which county your property is located in, if it is a hillside lot, how much the first floor walls need fortifying as well as how big you want it and other design features. If the addition is extensive and complicated, a 12-month timeline is much more feasible, according to <span class=\"s2\">Sweeten <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5852#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">L.A. contractor Shannon<\/span><\/a>.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since some of your roof will be removed, you should start this type of project in early Spring, said Tami. This is so you can ideally have the project completed by the winter, which is the rainy season for L.A. Forest fires fueled by the Santa Ana winds\u2014which blow October through April\u2014can also hinder a renovation project in affected areas.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much does it cost to add a second-story addition?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Expect to pay at least $100,000 for a second-story addition, Tami said. Contractor Shannon put the starting cost to add a second story at around $200 a square foot. Some <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractors in L.A. have completed second-story additions for as low as $300 a square foot, and up to $700 a square foot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two key factors that will determine your costs to add a second story:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>If it&#8217;s structurally driven<\/strong>: In L.A., <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-guide-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovating on a hillside lot<\/a> will take more time and cost more money. This is especially the case for second-story additions, Shannon said. The project will require a soil engineer and a soil report to determine if any additional foundation work needs to be completed to support the addition.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The walls of any home, regardless of whether it sits on a flat lot or on a hillside, will also need to be assessed and most likely reinforced to support the additional story. Your first-floor ceiling which must now do double duty as your second story\u2019s floor also needs added help. \u201cThis usually requires supporting beams and posts,\u201d said Tami.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>If it&#8217;s client-driven<\/strong>: This means your tastes and what you want or need will have a big impact on your budget, according to Tami. Do you want <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a bathroom<\/a> or even <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a kitchenette<\/a>? Multiple bedrooms? How expensive will your finishes be? The good news is that, unlike structural elements, the client-driven aspect of your budget is all within your control.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46413\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post a Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/h3>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do second-story additions increase your home\u2019s value?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Slapping on a second story isn\u2019t all money out. It does add value, and in some cases, a <em>lot<\/em> of value. To calculate how much you can recoup when you eventually sell your home, figure out what your second-story renovation will cost per square foot. Then, compare it to the square-foot price of homes in your area that match the size and amenities of your home once the planned renovation is completed.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another factor to consider is the cost of moving. For many growing families, a second-story addition is a remedy to finding a bigger house elsewhere. Selling a home isn\u2019t free. Nor is moving. When you sell a home, it generally costs at least six percent of its value. Then, add to that several thousand dollars if you enlist a moving company.\u00a0 For the family mentioned above, the cost to move would have been at least $50,000<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What is the impact on your first floor?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">It\u2019s very rare that the first floor of a home will have the muscle to support a second-story addition without help. \u201c<\/span><span class=\"s1\">In my experience, doing a second story involves the first story,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ca\/los-angeles-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Los Angeles contractor<\/a> Shannon. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pop on a second story.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As stated earlier, the walls and ceilings of your original home will need added beams and poles to hold the extra weight. Your foundations will be examined too, especially if your lot is on a hillside. As you can tell, your first floor will be thoroughly disturbed. Because of this, many homeowners opt to renovate part of their original home by <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expanding kitchens<\/a>, giving a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bathroom a facelift<\/a>, or adding new rooms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One necessity that homeowners often forget about is where to put the staircase, according to Shannon. Unless you\u2019re intending to use a ladder, be prepared for the staircase to eat into some of that first-floor living space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Getting permits for a second-story addition renovation<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The majority of second-story additions involve an additional bedroom and bathroom. That means, on top of a general building permit, your project will require electrical, plumbing, and mechanical (if you have an HVAC system).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The length of time for permits to be approved will vary from area to area. For example, the permits required for a second-story addition can take about 12 weeks for the City of Los Angeles. Paying an expeditor can always reduce wait times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As with all other remodeling projects in the State of California, your second-story addition must be Title 24 compliant. Title 24 puts an energy consumption limit on your home and impacts factors like what light bulbs you use, to the efficiency of your air conditioning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Negotiating zoning rules for second-story additions\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For most second-story additions, zoning is not an issue, but there are some cases where it can impact your plans. Here are a few rules to look out for:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">In recent years, some L.A. counties have gone to war against mansionization, where new builds create massive, box-like houses. These ruin the look and feel of areas historically filled with quainter structures. For example, the Los Angeles City Council reduced the floor area of new homes or proposed remodels to 45 percent of the lot size, Curbed <a href=\"https:\/\/la.curbed.com\/2017\/3\/1\/14783162\/los-angeles-mansionization-rules-mcmansions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">reported<\/span><\/a> in 2017.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">If your home is in a historic preservation overlay zone (HPOZ), then any proposed changes to the outside of your building will be scrutinized. Any changes will either not be allowed to move forward or permit approvals could take a long time. A neighborhood association can also hold sway over your second-story dreams.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other factors you need to consider are height restrictions and whether you will block your neighbor&#8217;s view. This is often the case with hillside lots, said Sweeten contractor Shannon. One of her Malibu clients wanted to add a second story to a home that already had high ceilings. However, due to <a href=\"https:\/\/qcode.us\/codes\/malibu-coastal\/view.php?topic=local_implementation_plan-6-6_5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">height restrictions<\/span><\/a>\u201424 feet for flat-roofed homes and 28 for pitched roofs\u2014the client couldn\u2019t fit the second story in.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Powerline clearance is also something to watch. Typically a residential structure needs to be at least <span class=\"s2\">15 feet below<\/span> any overhead powerlines. This might not be an issue if you\u2019re adding a second story to your home, which is unlikely to be under powerlines. However, when it comes to another floor for your garage, this is something to watch out for.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re dreaming of a bigger home, but you love the house you live in, consider second-story additions.
