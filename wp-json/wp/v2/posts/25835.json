While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced me to a few contractors<\/a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.<\/p>\n<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Working with everyone on my contractor\u2019s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor\u2019s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn\u2019t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn\u2019t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naivet\u00e9, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif\" alt=\"ladder to garage attic\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Building a ladder to the attic<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/live-large-small-apartment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage, we utilized the space<\/a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That\u2019s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I\u2019m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn\u2019t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when \u201cflushed,\u201d then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the bathroom is a small 3\u2019 x 4\u2019 space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg\" alt=\"garage bathroom remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.<\/p>\n<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/5-tile-trends-every-surface\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">next big project was the backsplash<\/a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which direction I wanted the French doors<\/a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she\u00a0can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.<\/p>\n<p><i>Thank you, Michelle, for sharing the story of your she shed, The Shak with us!
