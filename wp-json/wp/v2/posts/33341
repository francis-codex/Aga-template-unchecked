She spent several years, on and off, going to open houses and scrolling through endless listings. When she came across this apartment in a prewar co-op building on West End Avenue, with beautiful light from a southern exposure and the right amount of space, she knew it was the one. It was a one-bed, one-bath and measured about 500 square feet. More happy changes were in store for Melissa, however. Between the time that her offer was accepted and the final approval from the board, her boyfriend proposed! They now had to ensure that the apartment could accommodate both of them and their belongings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33421\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-Before-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-Before\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33420\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-After-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-After\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33422 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Before-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Before-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33423 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"built-in storage\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given the challenge of creating a functional layout and enough storage for two people, Melissa <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/21282\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turned to Sweeten<\/a> to find an architect who would help them \u201cuse every inch of space in the best possible way.\u201d They chose to go with <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Sweeten contractor<\/a> with architectural services to transform the space. Originally, the apartment had what was likely the world\u2019s smallest kitchen\u2014so tiny it could have easily fit into a coat closet. Its appliances were typical of those found in dorm rooms: a mini-fridge, a compact range, and an unsightly microwave mounted to the underside of one of two sets of upper cabinets. The bathroom was also too small, with a sink that you could barely wash your hands in and no space to turn around. To top it off, the apartment had just one closet.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brown-wooden-custom-cabinets\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33426 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset10.gif\" alt=\"brown wooden custom cabinets with open and closed shelves after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"wooden-veneer-custom-cabinets\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33425\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset09.gif\" alt=\"wooden veneer custom cabinets on light brown vinyl floor after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having identified the problems that they needed to solve, Melissa worked with her architect and contractor (whom she hired separately) to achieve her goals: a kitchen that could hold full-sized appliances, plenty of closet space, as well as a larger bathroom. Fortunately, there was space to be taken from the large bedroom to create a more spacious bathroom. Her Sweeten architect also designed a full wall of storage space, faced with simple oak slab fronts in each the kitchen and the bedroom. By establishing aesthetic continuity throughout the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen<\/a> and the storage wall, the architect was able to make all the additions Melissa and her fianc\u00e9 needed without making the apartment feel cramped.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The cabinetry directly across from the bathroom door opened to reveal built-in hampers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33428 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset08-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"built-in storage\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"wood-veneer-custom-cabinets-kitchen\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33429 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset05.gif\" alt=\"wood veneer custom cabinets in kitchen and bedroom after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n(Above) Looking from the kitchen toward the bedroom<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the far corner of the living room, the storage wall included open shelving as well as hidden storage for a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bar and a wine fridge<\/a> underneath. As the wall progressed into the kitchen area, the wall accommodated a counter-depth refrigerator directly across from the sink and stove area to create a kitchen nook.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"custom-cabinetry-wood-veneer\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33430 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset07.gif\" alt=\"custom cabinetry in wood veneer with long nickel handles after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"natural-wood-veneer-custom-cabinets\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33431 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset11.gif\" alt=\"natural wood veneer custom cabinets for a walk in closet in bedroom after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"wood-veneer-cabinetry-small-compartments\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33432 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset16.gif\" alt=\"wood veneer cabinetry and small compartments for light swiches after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n(From top) Hampers across from bathroom; closet in the bedroom; light switches in the bedroom<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the wall continued past the kitchen, the cabinetry directly across from the bathroom door opened to reveal built-in hampers. Immediately beyond a blackened-oak pocket door was the bedroom. The storage wall continued here, concealing various more drawers as well as a full walk-in closet that was customized to the homeowners\u2019 needs. Some utilitarian details got swept up in the design. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have space to move the switches, so we left them as is and then just added the small compartment,&#8221; Melissa said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33433 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset18\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"porcelain-tile-kitchen-brushed-nickel-fittings\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33434\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset23.gif\" alt=\"Porcelain tile kitchen with brushed nickel faucet and white vessel sink along with wood veneer custom cabinet after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aesthetic carried through to the now-enlarged bathroom, which incorporated a larger shower area and\u00a0yet more <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage<\/a>\u2014artfully tucked between an immovable beam and the far wall of the shower.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that the renovation is complete, Melissa shares that the biggest challenge was the time it took to get approvals from the DOB (Dept. of Buildings).\u00a0On the\u00a0final design,\u00a0Melissa tells us, \u201cAll the materials were chosen with the idea of making the space feel larger, which seems to be driven by a more modern look. However, my fianc\u00e9 and I are more traditional, so our architect looked for transitional pieces. The woodwork has modern lines, but the hanging light fixtures in the kitchen are more traditional. We were looking for a unique backsplash in the kitchen and ended up picking something that&#8217;s reminiscent of a tin roof in many original NYC ceilings. I love the feeling of a\u00a0spa, so we chose bathroom tiles that appeared like stones.\u201d Mixing styles to bring function and design together\u00a0has helped make the couple&#8217;s apartment exactly what they needed.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Melissa!
