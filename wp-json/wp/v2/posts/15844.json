Brooklynite Laura is not one of those people. When Laura decided it was finally time to overhaul the 1950s kitchen of her Windsor Terrace co-op, she took on the project with complete pragmatism. After renovating the kitchen of a prior home and watching the process drag and get buried in minutiae, Laura had no interest in obsessing over decisions\u2014she wanted a contractor who could help her bring the kitchen into this millennium while explicitly guiding her on what was needed and when. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/lauras-kitchen-renovation-sweeten-in-windsor-terrace\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16203 mb-0\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/laura-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn\" width=\"600\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/laura-kitchen.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/laura-kitchen-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laura lived in her two-bedroom, two-bath co-op for about five years before taking on the old-school kitchen. The kitchen\u2019s footprint gave her a good bit of storage space, but the floor was shot and only looked serviceable in the five minutes after it was mopped. Laura had real affection for the original stove (complete with warming oven), but an update was clearly in order. After hearing positive things about <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from a renovation-obsessed friend, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/2820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">she posted her renovation<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and we matched her with <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1169\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten Expert Kris<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who had also worked on that same friend\u2019s home.<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15833\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laura had ambitious plans to carve out a pantry from space in the dining room, but Kris explained that the move might be too expensive. Instead, they worked together to create a plan that would be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">structurally identical to what was already there\u2014but vastly improved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI am someone who cannot read an architect\u2019s drawing. The details of all the things that you are expected to keep track of, down to buying knobs for the cabinets, just drove me crazy,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI wanted the contractor to take care of as much as possible.\u201d And so Kris did. He started by creating a plan that she could read and then set to work installing custom maple cabinets, translucent subway backsplash tiles, and a cheery aqua paint finish to brighten the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laura chose sturdy granite countertops and Kris added a new corner built-in along with open shelving above to stash cookbooks\u2014ending a habit of running to the study anytime Laura wanted to check a recipe. Neutral ceramic floor tiles ensure Laura won\u2019t have to mop often for the kitchen to look its best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire renovation cost about $35,000, with no big surprises thanks to Kris and his straightforward plan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15837\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-04-05.gif\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn sweeten\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15834\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn sweeten\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-01-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-15836 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn sweeten\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-03-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kris was so efficient that the project initially came in under budget, so he was able to slip in some targeted updates in the bathroom and still keep the total budget on track. He replaced delightfully pink-and-white (but badly damaged) tiles with extra floor tiles from the kitchen and re-tiled the walls with simple white subway tile and high-contrast dark grout. Kris removed a throwback wall-mounted laundry shoot and added a new sink, mirror, and vanity light fixture &#8211; all within Laura\u2019s original budget! <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process rolled along smoothly, minus a snowstorm that delayed the speedy six-week schedule by exactly one day. Laura credits the truncated schedule to slotting her soup-to-nuts demolition in the dead of winter and to Kris. \u201cKris was very good about letting me know what needed to be done and when it needed to be done,\u201d Laura said. \u201cI didn\u2019t wind up with things I couldn\u2019t use or make mistakes, which is what I was afraid of.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15835\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn sweeten\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-02.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-02-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15838\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation brooklyn sweeten\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-06.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-15839 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen renovation bodum\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-07.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SWEETEN_Laura_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laura\u2019s best advice for those renovating?
