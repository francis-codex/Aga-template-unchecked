But when you&#8217;ve optimized every inch and <em>still<\/em> need more space, the question becomes: <strong>how do you make a galley kitchen bigger?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Demolishing the entire kitchen and its surrounding walls is not always a realistic option. Bringing down walls partially provides some openness while not eliminating all walls which are important for storage. Another way to expand a galley kitchen layout is by allowing the kitchen to extend into nearby living spaces. See how the five Sweeten renovations below snuck in a little more outside their two walls.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A countertop extension perfect for parties<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24796\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of taking down walls to open things up, Joel and Eric worked with their designers to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wraparound kitchen countertop<\/a> to join the kitchen and nearby dining room. The one-piece counter is perfect for hosting parties: it provides a spot for pouring drinks and serving buffet-style dinners without leaving the kitchen. As a bonus, the extended storage helps mitigate the build-up of clutter.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Simple solution: a pass-through<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"built in oven in a kitchen pass through\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-42267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-585x878.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-1170x1755.jpg 1170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Gina and Andrew\u2019s kitchen was closed off from the rest of their apartment. As a layout, being closed off isn\u2019t always undesired. However, the couple wanted to move beyond their dark galley kitchen, which also had an awkward layout. Their plans required moving a load-bearing wall. Therefore, architectural drawings needed to be submitted for approval. It was worth it for their Sweeten contractor to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two-seat breakfast bar<\/a> (and fit a stackable washer and dryer). The pass-through gave a new dimension to the galley layout. It also created a welcomed social aspect between the kitchen and dining area. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A patio comes inside<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43703 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"bay window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Laura-kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Laura-kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Laura and Tim were ready to trade in their \u201cold and grungy\u201d kitchen in their 1929 brick townhouse.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 They <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/kitchen-patio-house-extension\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remodeled their galley kitchen<\/a> and kept the layout\u2014with one major change. They enclosed an outdoor patio at the back of the kitchen that had a drafty door which was also poorly located. The new plan was to envelop the patio into the cook space and the adjacent dining area. What started as a kitchen remodel turned into a full-blown extension project. A skylight in the new enclosure brought in a stream of natural light.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Galley kitchen inspiration: Turn the corner<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28650 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Melissa and Blake's kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"how to make a galley kitchen bigger\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shifting the location of a nearby closet allowed Melissa and Blake to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enlarge the galley kitchen<\/a> into the living room. This created space for more cabinets, a wine rack, and counter space. Their Sweeten contractor removed a second closet also outside the kitchen and built a bar counter with seating in its place. By &#8220;turning the corners&#8221; off the galley, the couple gained a lot more kitchen space.<\/p>\n<h3>Separating the dining area from the kitchen<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27107 size-chrono\" title=\"Lisa and Chris' kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"how to make a galley kitchen bigger\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nMoving the eating nook outside of the kitchen allowed Lisa and Chris to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extend their cabinets<\/a> along the back wall. The sink and stove remained in the same locations. However, the fridge was relocated allowing the opposite wall to have a long continuous countertop. A part of the wall was partially removed to create a large, eat-in peninsula.
