These accounts will help you to establish a custom online presence in communities where your past and potential clients already spend their time. Whether you have already created pages or you are looking to start from scratch, business pages allow your audience to easily find your company, increasing the credibility of your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">a service that connects qualified <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/signup\/expert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general contractors, builders, and remodelers<\/a> with homeowners and design professionals with renovation projects, offers\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this guide to help you establish an online presence. When speaking with clients, frequently referenced sites include Facebook and Instagram. Pulling together cohesive messaging and showcasing past projects on these platforms can help give your firm a leg up. Ready to grow your business\u2019s presence on social media?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Facebook Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Establish your profile<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before creating a Facebook business page, you must establish an individual profile on Facebook if you do not have one already. You can use an existing individual profile to create a page for your contracting business or start a new individual profile specifically for the purposes of setting up your company page. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that there is some overlap in login information between company pages and individual profiles, so if you want team members to have access, it may make sense to start an individual account that is solely for business purposes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Create your business page (or clean it up!)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve established an individual profile, \u201cCreate a Page\u201d for your business. Upload a Profile Picture and Cover Photo &#8212; pages with cover photos typically get more page likes and visits! Choose photos that showcase your work and that you\u2019d be proud to have potential clients see. This is where you want to show your best work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already have a profile, take some time to remove any content or posts that don\u2019t support or strengthen your business profile. A good gut check is to ask yourself, would I show this photo to potential clients? If the answer is no, take it off your business page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your services<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Description: Write a brief description that will appear in the search results. This is where you can let people know <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they should engage with your business and what neighborhoods you operate in. What are your specialties and in-house capabilities? How will you help clients achieve their goals? Evaluate this description once a year and consider using it across your online profiles including in your Sweeten company description!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Use quality pictures that showcase past work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should choose 3 or 4 projects (like you did to join Sweeten!) that showcase your strengths and the beautiful work that your company does to get your business page started. In general, post valuable content that will resonate with your audience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have an awesome project underway? Post photos of in-progress projects or completed projects so your audience can get a taste of your work experience. Pick a few photos and write up a few sentences to describe the scope of work that you accomplished for each project. Again use that gut check, if you wouldn\u2019t show the photo to potential clients &#8212; don\u2019t upload it to your page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Promote your page<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You now have a Facebook business page that will give potential clients a feel for your firm.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When people like your page, it&#8217;s easier for others to discover it.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use your other channels like your website or Sweeten profile to promote your page. You can even connect it with your firm\u2019s Instagram account so you can update both simultaneously. Linking the page can be one way of minimizing upkeep, but remember to check in on the account at least every 6 months to make updates and add new photos of recent work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Instagram<\/strong><strong>\u00a0Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Establish your account\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the Instagram app as there are many features not available on the desktop version of their site. Pick a username or \u201chandle\u201d that represents your business. Try to use some combination of your company name or initials and keywords for the industry (think \u201chome,\u201d \u201cremodeling,\u201d \u201cGC,\u201d \u201ccontractor,\u201d etc.) <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you just signed up or already have a handle, switch the account to \u201cprofessional\u201d and review the privacy settings to set your account as public so potential clients can easily find your account.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Define your business and a company bio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add your company name so clients can identify or search for your firm. Write a brief company bio and try to stick to the 150 character limit. Include where you are based, and highlight your firm\u2019s strengths, goals or accolades.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fill up the grid<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick at least nine photos that you are the proudest of to get your profile off the ground. Once you\u2019ve filled up the initial grid, you\u2019ll have a great base to build off of. If you already have an account, consider deleting any posts that don\u2019t support the services you are trying to convey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Provide captions for your photos<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write a short caption for each posted photo to let clients know why that photo is significant. Don\u2019t be afraid to use hashtags in the caption or tag other accounts in the photo. Engaging with other accounts through hashtags, tags, and comments can help others find and follow your account. You can also add geotags so potential clients can see the general location of any projects that you post. These features can be edited or updated at any time, so they\u2019re ideal you\u2019re looking to refresh old posts with photos.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Follow others in your industry<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sweeten_home\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@sweeten_home on Instagram<\/a> and then follow any industry contacts that you might have, including designers, architects, subcontractors, or showrooms.
