Broadway runs through it, and landmarks like the Apthorp, the Dakota, and Lincoln Center lend their impressive architecture to the texture of the neighborhood. The\u00a0brownstone-lined blocks are quiet in the early mornings and evenings,\u00a0making it an ideal spot for city dwellers seeking solitude.

They found an apartment on the Upper West Side that satisfied their desire for pre-war architectural details. However, living with modern amenities meant updating the electrical wiring which was not expected, but had to be done. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adding a washer\/dryer<\/a> and a dedicated home office space were top of their list. After living in the suburbs with easy access to laundry units, they never wanted to be without them in Manhattan again. The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen was overhauled<\/a> and they loved ditching the bathtub for a large shower stall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they had past renovation knowledge, every experience had its unexpected nuances.

To put the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen plan into action<\/a>, she hired a woman-owned contracting firm through Sweeten. The plan included replacing the electrical box and addressing plumbing issues before installing a new sink and faucet. Another top focus was purchasing small-sized appliances such as an 18&#8243; dishwasher, a 24&#8243; fridge, and a 20&#8243; range.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The homeowner appreciated the way her <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractor worked with her<\/a> during the remodel; it was a solution-based approach. When they ran into budget issues, the contractor offered alternative solutions that proved just as effective. Constant communication was highlighted as the reason for her smooth renovation. Similarly, we also checked in periodically with the homeowner. While no issues arose with the contractor, the homeowner found comfort in having us available to step in, if needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A penthouse overhaul<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp\" alt=\"Penthouse remodel on the Upper West Side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-58105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-600x400.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Film director and novelist <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jan Eliasberg made the decision<\/a> to purchase a penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side. Few were willing to undertake the dual challenge of acquiring a property and renovating it in the third month of the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1,750-square-foot apartment presented numerous challenges, including roof leaks, asbestos-laced glue under the linoleum, mold, and a perplexing layout. With the help of her Sweeten contractor and a designer, they strategically modified the apartment, creating a seamless flow that emphasized the elegance of the tall ceilings and original windows. While addressing code violations, asbestos hazards, and water damage, the contractor&#8217;s professionalism and expertise proved invaluable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping within the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">parameters of the co-op&#8217;s remodeling budget<\/a>, Jan successfully completed her project despite unforeseen obstacles, including Jan being the first homeowner to have central air installed in her apartment in the building\u2019s history.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A small bathroom remodeling success<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg\" alt=\"black bathroom on the upper west side with walk in shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-58107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/bathroom-renovations\/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veronica&#8217;s bathroom remodel<\/a> was always on the to-do list, but it felt overwhelming and expensive. However, things took a turn when she received a complaint from her downstairs neighbors about a leak from her tub. This incident prompted Veronica to take on the challenge of renovating the entire bathroom. She met with several Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/manhattan-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractors who did work on the Upper West Side<\/a> and chose the right one to partner with. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of her favorite additions was the walk-in shower, which not only made the space feel more open but also gave it a modern touch. She further improved the room&#8217;s aesthetics by opting for a wall-mounted sink instead of an 18-inch vanity, which wouldn\u2019t have stored much anyway. Although she initially planned to install a wall-mounted toilet, it didn\u2019t fit the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc\/\">bathroom remodeling budget nor the permit costs<\/a> it would require.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Vital communication skills<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg\" alt=\"apartment remodel on upper west side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-58115\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apartment-on-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apartment-on-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tijesh, an experienced renovator, discovered his 750-square-foot <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/upper-west-side-apartment-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted his project<\/a> to find a GC.

For example, a peninsula connected the newly-opened kitchen to the dining room space.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plan for the bathroom upgrade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proved challenging with no ability to rearrange the plumbing. Therefore, the solution was a rip-and-replace with streamlined fixtures and a glass-enclosed walk-in shower. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were some unexpected hiccups and delays during the remodel but his Sweeten contractor kept the project moving along.

The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">remodeling budget for the kitchen<\/a> facilitated the removal of the walls and connected it to both the living and dining rooms on either side.
