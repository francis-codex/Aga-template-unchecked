It felt livable, and that\u2019s why these finance execs-cum-parents of now high-school-age daughters put the finishing touches on their renovation nearly a decade after buying it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They did it by listing the project on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Sweeten<\/span><\/a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, combing through bids and hiring <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1368#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">this design-build firm<\/span><\/a>. The result: an eclectic redo that delivered this trad home straight into the 21st century.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The single-family house, built in the early 1960s, is like many in this Westchester County suburb. Its layout featured a formal entry hall and a dedicated dining room, plus <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a finished basement<\/a> that boosts the total square footage. When the family of four and their pets moved into the home, it had just received a round of pre-sale renovations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The kids were in elementary school. \u201cWe always knew we\u2019d update it and make it more our style at some point,\u201d the owner said, \u201cbut we weren\u2019t in a rush.\u201d They\u2019d lived happily in Manhattan for 15 years, and then in a rental in Scarsdale for three more before committing to the new home. \u201cWe wanted,\u201d said the owner, \u201cto live in our home long enough to find a clear vision.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">When the goal of the project crystallized, it was fairly simple: They wanted to preserve the home\u2019s great bones and traditional features\u2014including old hardwood floors, large windows with a diamond grill pattern, some stained-glass touches\u2014and blend in a modern-classic feel. Some plans were solely functional. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The bathrooms, which had not been renovated since the home was built, were outdated and slated for a full redo. But the rest of the house would get a gentle, progressively modern update that would play off and enhance what was already there.\u00a0 They decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/renovate-home-once-pieces-expert-192016677.html?guccounter=1\">renovate their whole home at once<\/a>, instead of in pieces.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43506 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg\" alt=\"Foyer stairs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Jaahred-stairs-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Jaahred-stairs-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">We now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe were excited about the job as a whole,\u201d the owner said, but \u201crelieved to know we could do a lot just by just adding a few touches.\u201d In the end, they did a bit more than that. The home\u2019s spacious foyer, already a stunner, got a dramatic makeover, featuring daring large-slab marble tile and a deco-style beaded chandelier. Those bathrooms got their gut-jobs, redone with glass-walled showers, gleaming fixtures, and statement lighting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The mudroom received a sleek redesign, with functional storage, and whimsical bright-blue penny-round floor tile. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen received a playful update<\/a>, with a painted hardwood floor, a boldly mirrored backsplash, and a wraparound marble overlay on the existing peninsula providing a stylish second life for the high-end cabinetry that was already there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The process, the owner warned, was grueling at times, especially since the family of four lived in the house throughout. \u201cWe expected some inconvenience\u2014especially since we have a dog and a cat\u2014but it was a big challenge,\u201d the owner said. \u201cTowels and blankets under doors went a long way, but dust found its way around.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Despite inconveniences, the project also bore happy surprises, like the ugly, thin carpet in the office that lifted to reveal a beautiful parquet floor. The Sweeten contractor cleaned it up and stained it white, which markedly opened the space. \u201cWe now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor,\u201d the owner says. While to some this might sound like a nightmare scenario, these little-bit-of-everything-loving homeowners find the mixed-up style \u201cvery cool.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because one never knows when a gorgeous discovery will save the contractors a few days\u2019 effort, this homeowner suggests taking time to map out the renovation process in detail, with contingencies. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">And ask for the tough love you need to maintain your timeline: ordering deadlines for materials so you\u2019ll have them before they\u2019re needed; assignments for moving things around the house as work carries on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur contractor,\u201d the homeowner says, \u201cwas patient and thoughtful about what needed to be ordered. More important, he completed work on time, if not early. He was easy to work with, responsive and flexible. We also knew that, should that attitude change, Sweeten had our backs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46407\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png\" alt=\"Get Matched With Contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Opportunities for efficiency and satisfaction can be found by playing an active part in the project, the homeowner said. Living in the house throughout the process, he says, allowed the family to see it day-to-day. \u201cMy favorite part,\u201d he said, \u201cwas watching the rooms finish one by one and seeing the larger picture slowly emerge.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>WATCH VIDEO:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EcJCSuhGrd8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the end, he said, the family stayed close to their budgeted figures and felt real satisfaction in the job\u2019s completion. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be done and the house finally feels like our home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vision we had came together, and now we can build on it with details like family photos and objects we love.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you for sharing the new face of your family home!<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Ready to start your own New York home renovation?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46413\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post a Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">FOYER RESOURCES: Astra Turchese Blue High Honed 23\u201dx23\u201dx3\/8\u201d floortile: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.artistictile.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Artistic Tile<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Stair paint:<\/span><span class=\"s4\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finepaintsofeurope.com\/index.aspx\"><span class=\"s1\">Fine Paints of Europe<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">DINING ROOM RESOURCES: Eternity (AF-695) wall paint in semi gloss: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\"><span class=\"s2\">Benjamin Moore<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0 Sterling (1591) trim paint in high gloss: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\"><span class=\"s2\">Benjamin Moore<\/span><\/a>.
