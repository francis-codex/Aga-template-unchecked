Photos by Kate Glicksberg.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why is the scope of work important?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cScope of work\u201d or &#8220;scope&#8221; is construction lingo for the list of work that needs to be done in a remodeling project. When a contractor asks for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your project scope<\/a>, they\u2019re really asking, \u201cWhat are all the things you need me to do?\u201d Sweeten breaks it all down below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Sweeten<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What is the scope of work?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Early in your planning, like when you first post your project on the Sweeten platform or start talking to general contractors, your scope will likely be vague. For example, \u201cI want to renovate the master bathroom, including retiling and replacing cabinets and fixtures.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Later, when it comes time to ask general contractors for estimates, you\u2019ll work with them to fill in the details. These important details make up the scope of work! The details will cover the exact work that needs to be done, including materials and fixture specifics, and plans drawn for any changes to the layout, pipes, or wiring (see \u201cRenovation scope of work example\u201d below).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">All the specifics need to be in writing by the time you ask for a contract. Once you\u2019ve signed, additional changes to the scope of work are considered \u201cchange orders,\u201d and will bring additional costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finessing your budget and scope of work<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Often, you won\u2019t be able to move from a general to specific scope until you know the cost of all the options. We suggest making a list of everything you want, divided into <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/a-renovation-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cmust-haves\u201d and \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d<\/a> Your general contractor can help you decide on a specific scope that fits your budget, including as many \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>My scope exceeds my budget. Now what?<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">If your contractor makes <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/can-i-ask-my-contractor-for-a-revised-estimate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an estimate that exceeds your budget<\/a>, it\u2019s time to negotiate. Please don\u2019t just ask for a discount. General contractors operate on very low margins; you\u2019d be asking them to lose money. Instead, ask questions about how to adjust the scope to fit your budget. You might get some surprising and imaginative ideas. Sweeten general contractors are often wizards at this kind of creative problem-solving to make potential clients happy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A remodeling rule-of-thumb: The more rigid your budget, the more flexible your scope should be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If a scope of work isn\u2019t possible<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Occasionally a general contractor will tell you that something in your scope is impossible. This can be disappointing\u2014but we promise, they\u2019re not just being difficult. Sometimes there will be structural reasons that something can\u2019t be done. Other times there will be strict national or local building codes that have to be obeyed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Pro tip: Always ask why something in the scope can\u2019t be done. You might start a conversation with your contractor that leads to ideas that are just as satisfying as the original.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Prep scopes before the estimate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">You might want to consider more than one scope. For example, one version might be a kitchen remodel that includes changing the floor plan and opening a wall. Another version could be a simple rip-and-replace of the existing cabinets and finishes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s fine to present these alternate versions to your general contractor, as long as you do so before asking them to create any estimates. And you should keep it to just two variations. Beyond two, your contractor might ask for an additional deposit\u2014because drawing up detailed estimates is time-consuming work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Example of a scope of work in construction<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Replace toilet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Replace vanity cabinet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Change out sink<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Retile floor<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Relocate shower\u2014see plans<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Install cement board<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Tile shower\/tub surround<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Replace light fixture<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Add outlets\u2014see plans<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Paint walls and ceiling<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The scope of work, in summary<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Start with a general scope, with your must-haves and nice-to-haves. Moving on to your final, detailed scope requires negotiating many variables. Your Sweeten general contractor can be a valuable resource in this process. Be sure to communicate clearly, ask questions, and give as much information as possible before requesting a bid. And remember: the details in a contract finalize your scope. Any additions to the scope after you\u2019ve signed the contract will be considered a change order, which might push you over budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Sweeten matches you with vetted general contractors<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class=\"s2\">renovate with the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best contractors<\/a><\/span>. <\/span>You can email our renovation specialists with questions about your scope of work at any time at team@sweeten.com.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
