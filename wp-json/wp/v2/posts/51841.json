Our <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> general contractors offer advice on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sustainable home remodeling<\/a> in Los Angeles\u00a0with energy and water conservation in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy conservation in L.A.<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cEnergy conservation and cool conservation are the same thing,\u201d said L.A.-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten general contractor Chen<\/a>. If you can adequately cool the home, you have gone a long way toward conserving the heat, too. The best place to start conserving heat is with airtightness.<\/p>\n<h3>Airtightness<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThink of your house as a bucket of water,\u201d said Chen. \u201cIf you have any holes in the bucket, that\u2019s water escaping from the bucket. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/energysaver\/weatherize\/air-sealing-your-home\">Airtightness<\/a> is the same with your home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The aim is to prevent conditioned interior air from escaping\u2014whether cool or warm air. There are airtight home products that can help with this. For instance, caulk is used around stationary home elements like door and window frames. Weatherstripping is also used for movable components, such as the door itself or the window sash.<\/p>\n<h3>Home insulation types<\/h3>\n<p>Home insulation is a requirement for all new construction and remodeled homes. Whether holding in heated or cooled air, a wide range of home insulation projects can help.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6071#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten general contractor Jose<\/a>, also based in Los Angeles, noted that spray foam insulation is becoming increasingly popular. Spray foam insulation is especially good for vaulted ceilings since it conforms to voids in the building envelope.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore people are adopting spray foam insulation,\u201d said Jose, \u201cthough it is a little bit dirtier than some other types of insulation,\u201d meaning that foam will off-gas. But in the end, he noted, when you do a cost-benefit analysis, you might come out ahead environmentally.<\/p>\n<p>While fiberglass is still the main type of home insulation used in remodels, it\u2019s not the only product out there. Every so often, he will use denim insulation, mainly because it is eco-friendly and excellent for soundproofing.<\/p>\n<h3>Home heating and cooling systems<\/h3>\n<p>That traditional feature of Southern California side yards\u2014the hulking HVAC unit\u2014may soon pass into oblivion.<\/p>\n<p>VRF (variable refrigerant flow) units are far smarter and more green than central units, which heat or cool the entire house at once. \u201cThese are far better than traditional central air,\u201d said Chen. \u201cThese products adapt to the areas of the house where you need the heat or cooling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As an example, you might have <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-guide-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a 5-bedroom house<\/a> with separate variable refrigerant flow units in each room. All units are connected to one large outdoor unit. This unit senses the needs and knows how to provide each unit with the right amount of heating or cooling.<\/p>\n<h3>Underfloor heating<\/h3>\n<p>In extremely cold climates, underfloor heating exists only to make your bare feet more comfortable on tile. But in moderately cool climates such as L.A.\u2019s, underfloor heating can be used for heating rooms. The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most common installation<\/a> of underfloor heating is in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bathrooms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sweeten contractor Chen said, \u201cWhen you think about the physics of heating, heat goes up. So heat that starts at the floor is most effective.\u201d Chen finds that the most efficient and sustainable type is water-based (hydronic) radiant heating systems, rather than electric cable systems.<\/p>\n<h4>Using solar power for home heating and cooling<\/h4>\n<p>The final and necessary component of home heating and cooling is solar power.<\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles general contractor Jose does a lot of solar installations but it always depends on the clients\u2019 budgets. He added that many clients like to go off-grid in terms of power. But off-grid doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re isolated out in the country. These are homes in the metro area.<\/p>\n<p>Solar power helps reduce the power draw for heating and cooling systems. Robust solar power systems even allow the homeowner to sell back credits to the power company.<\/p>\n<h3>Water conservation at home in L.A.<\/h3>\n<p>With water being so precious in L.A. and across all of Southern California, water conservation in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home remodels<\/a> is no longer a choice; it\u2019s a given. Luckily, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractors have a number<\/a> of weather-conserving initiatives to use during remodeling.<\/p>\n<h4>What is greywater?<\/h4>\n<p>Greywater is any residential wastewater that isn\u2019t septic waste (water from toilets or urinals). Greywater can be drainage from bathtubs, showers, kitchen and bathroom sinks, washing machines, or dishwashers.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on clients\u2019 budgets, Sweeten contractor Jose often does greywater reuse installations. At this time, greywater reuse is only approved for irrigation in Southern California.<\/p>\n<p>Tax credits for greywater reuse may be available. But he cautions that credits likely won\u2019t cover the cost of the greywater reuse installations\u2014at least not for the first few years.<\/p>\n<h4>Rainwater collection<\/h4>\n<p>Contrary to popular thought, it does rain in Southern California. Just ask a resident during one of the El Ni\u00f1o periods from September to November. Some years get up to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laalmanac.com\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30 to 40 inches of rain<\/a>, according to the Los Angeles Almanac.<\/p>\n<p>Rainwater collection can be as easy as purchasing rain barrels on your own to collect water runoff from the roof. Or you can speak with your contractor about larger capacity water harvesting systems as a sustainable solution.<\/p>\n<h4>Los Angeles water conservation rebates &amp; credits<\/h4>\n<p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ladwp.com\/ladwp\/faces\/ladwp\/residential\/r-savemoney\/r-sm-rebatesandprograms;jsessionid=KyJZhcbFtkrjGLg79Lp998y7rMQYm8CLfVTnKsr2vcnsJJHJ2p55!415314039?_afrLoop=298325548010414&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D298325548010414%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dy0dogbh89_4\">rebate programs that may help compensate<\/a> you for water conservation remodels.
