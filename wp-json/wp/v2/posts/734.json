Cost was the second concern. Because I had other places to stay during construction, time was the final consideration.<\/p>\n<p>As I moved through the project, though, cost became the overriding concern.  Initially, flushed with optimism, I made payments for materials and services without a fuss.  But as the project moved forward and the total cost crept closer and closer to my limit, I became increasingly suspect about spending money and searched more passionately for less costly substitutions.<\/p>\n<p>This was especially true for the smaller, more ornamental elements.  I spent a little extra money to get a faucet set for my bathroom sink from a high end supplier.  But I didn&#8217;t order the supplier&#8217;s matching toilet paper holder and towel bars because I couldn&#8217;t justify the extra expense for such simple pieces of hardware.  I returned a beautiful towel shelf I had ordered because, when the time came to install it, it felt too opulent.  Instead of ordering kitchen cabinet pulls from the supplier I bought them in bulk at a hardware store.<\/p>\n<p>I was especially alarmed by surprise costs, which came fast and furious at the end of the project.  My building management company mailed me an invoice for the cost of their &#8220;Architectural Review,&#8221; which they had not told me about.  I had to order extra wood panels from the cabinet supplier to complete the installation.  And I needed a myriad of small, last-minute items from the hardware store like a shower curtain rod and a lever for my toilet tank.  Each time I pulled out my credit card I winced.<\/p>\n<p>As in many other things, what helped most was to step back and take a larger view. The remodel was an investment that would ultimately increase the value of my home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My old boss used to say that for every project an architect has three equally-important priorities: cost, quality and schedule.
