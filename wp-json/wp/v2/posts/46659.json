When you\u2019re looking for furniture, think, \u201ccould this also have another function, a storage function?\u201d That definitely helps.<\/p>\n<p>In a smaller space, having less furniture will help you. It\u2019s easy to be like,\u00a0 &#8220;Well, this is a small sofa and then I have this small chair and this small chair\u2026\u201d and sometimes all of that will actually end up making the room look smaller because it\u2019s busier. Think about bringing as little contrast as possible if you\u2019re trying to make a room feel and look bigger.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Avoid a focal wall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the desire is to have a focal wall, which I totally get. But it does chop up the space. It makes your eye feel like the space is smaller when it\u2019s chopped up. We have an accent wall rule, and we&#8217;ve blogged about it before\u2026essentially, if it&#8217;s a niche, if it&#8217;s a dedicated space that architecturally is addressed differently, then that&#8217;s a great opportunity for an accent wall. But if you have four walls in a room, don&#8217;t just paint one a different color\u2014it just kind of chops up the space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg\" alt=\"studio bedroom and living room\" width=\"800\" height=\"538\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48381 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg 800w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-300x202.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-600x404.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowners hired designer Julia Oddo for their <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studio apartment renovation<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Jean: When and who should be hiring a designer?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Emily:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lack of time and experience<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing a pretty big renovation, whether it&#8217;s a whole house or even just doing your kitchen, and you truly don&#8217;t have the time, the desire, or experience, it&#8217;s a good idea to<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> think about hiring an interior designer<\/a> strictly because you&#8217;re going to make mistakes. Even we make mistakes all the time. It&#8217;s a luxury service, but I would say if you don&#8217;t have the time to really do the research to figure out how you want it to look and have the experience, then an interior designer will benefit you.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Design on the next level<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Hiring an interior designer will take your house to the next level. You&#8217;ll probably get more custom pieces. It&#8217;ll look more unique than if you bought all from different big box stores, but you don&#8217;t have to do it. You truly don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>The internet has made an average homeowner able to buy a great sofa. And because of Pinterest and Instagram, people can really do it themselves. Again, you&#8217;re still going to probably make some mistakes, but that&#8217;s okay. Whereas I think 30, 40 years ago, they didn&#8217;t have the resources. We didn&#8217;t have the stores.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jean:<\/strong> You always talk about how you want your house to feel. Interior designers don\u2019t just create a vibe. They deal with the elements of the actual things that you feel and touch, like the sofas and pillows.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Emily:<\/strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s my favorite stuff for sure. It&#8217;s the layering that makes it feel like a unique home.<\/p>\n<h3>Jean: How do we save time and money designing a home?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Emily:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do the preliminary work<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re working with an interior designer, and you have a pretty clear vision, that saves them a lot of guessing, a lot of back and forth. If you have a sofa you love, show it to them, because they&#8217;re going to source 10 different sofas to show to you and that takes time. An <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-interior-design-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interior designer&#8217;s costs<\/a> for their time is usually on an hourly basis. So I think the more work you can do upfront, the better.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Spend on &#8220;wow&#8221; pieces<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I have a different philosophy on where to splurge and save than everybody I know. These days there are very good sofas out there that are not that expensive that will also last for years. I feel like you should splurge on the conversation pieces like that amazing rug that nobody else has or a really great piece of art that will create a conversation. They&#8217;re the pieces you typically see that are vintage or custom, where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, I need&#8230;&#8221; That is going to just shift everything in the room and elevate everything.<\/p>\n<h3>Jean: Can you tell us what to do with blank or boring walls?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Emily:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Personality for each wall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome DIY artwork out there right now. I do have a rule about decorating your walls. When designing a room, address every wall differently with a different style. One wall might be a gallery wall, one might be a mirror, one might be a diptych, and one might be a sculpture. Whether it&#8217;s a gallery, big single art piece or diptych, grid, sculpture, or mirror, those are the five go-to&#8217;s that we use to address all walls.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dining area with gallery wall and open shelves above a piano\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg 1707w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s dining area and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gallery wall<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Art is the key<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re looking around and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I have one small piece on that, one small piece on that wall,&#8221; that might be something that you could change pretty easily that would make your house feel more styled, more pulled together.
