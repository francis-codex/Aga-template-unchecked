The bathroom hadn\u2019t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue\u2014blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub\u2014all in white\u2014replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.<\/p>\n<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono\" title=\"$15k bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom renovation costs\" width=\"723\" height=\"1066\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom<\/a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mario and Joe\u2019s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-ikea-bath-vanity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IKEA vanity<\/a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.<\/p>\n<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono\" title=\"$17k bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom renovation costs\" width=\"723\" height=\"1064\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom<\/a> in Kensington, Brooklyn<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.<\/p>\n<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono\" title=\"$20k bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom renovation costs\" width=\"723\" height=\"1084\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom<\/a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the \u201880s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.<\/p>\n<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono\" title=\"$20k bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom renovation costs\" width=\"723\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom<\/a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">storage<\/a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional\u00a0new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2014<\/p>\n<p>For an in-depth breakdown of the costs involved in renovating your bathroom, check out our guide <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Budget Basics: Bath Renovation Costs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
