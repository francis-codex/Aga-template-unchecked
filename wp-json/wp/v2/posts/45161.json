What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The key is keeping your layout the same. This means replacing your oven and dishwasher without moving their location so plumbing and gas lines can stay as is. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, value-brand appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"><br \/><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">For a high-end kitchen, <\/span><span class=\"s7\">labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000<\/strong>. The costs increase from there with custom features, new cabinets and appliances, and reconfiguring the layout.<\/span><span class=\"s6\"><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #333333;\">Sweeten contractor Santiago is currently working on an <b>$80,000 <\/b>kitchen remodel. For that price, the homeowner is getting custom cabinets, a quartzite countertop (quartzite is the natural version of quartz, which is manmade), light fixtures worth <strong>$300<\/strong> a pop, and high-end appliances from Sub-Zero and Wolf. \u201cOne issue that pushed up the cost is that the plans were changed several times,\u201d said Santiago, which lost buying power and time, which costs money. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48222 mb-48\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Houston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Houston-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Houston-RemodelingCosts--300x228.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Houston-RemodelingCosts--600x456.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Houston bathroom remodel costs per square foot<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"s1\">For a budget, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000 &#8211; $15,000<\/strong>. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn\u2019t move. This budget won\u2019t include any <\/span><span class=\"s8\">issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s1\">. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe key to maintaining a low budget is to shop around and apply filters when searching through websites,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cThat way you prevent wanting an item that is not under your budget.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the Houston area, a mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000 &#8211; $25,000<\/strong>. The average cost of a mid-grade bathroom remodel is about <strong>$19,000<\/strong> or <strong>$542<\/strong> psf, according to <em>Remodeling<\/em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/west-south-central\/houston-tx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s9\">report<\/span><\/a>. Like kitchens, the key to a budget in this range is sticking to the same layout. This avoids costly and time-consuming plumbing work.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">This budget is for a 35-square-foot bathroom with a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add almost <strong>$12,000<\/strong> to a home\u2019s value, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/west-south-central\/houston-tx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s9\">recouping<\/span><\/a> close to 60 percent of the project\u2019s cost.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s6\">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000<\/strong>. <\/span><span class=\"s7\">This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub\/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5\u2019 x 7\u2019 space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.<\/span><span class=\"s6\"><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs for adding outdoor space<\/span><\/h5>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Houston is a great city for year-round outside entertaining. Crisp winter nights can be spent by the fire pit. Humid summer afternoons can be paired with a cold drink on the patio. An outdoor area is a project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #333333;\">\u201cA high-end patio that we worked on recently involved building an outdoor grill station with a roof,\u201d said Santiago, of the <b>$25,000<\/b> project. \u201cThe only thing that pushed up the cost was trying to find the specific brick that the client wanted.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #333333;\">Nathan recently completed an outdoor patio and kitchen with a budget of<b> $50,000.<\/b> It had a gas range, a fridge plus another one just for wine, ambient lighting, security cameras, a pergola and an area for the client\u2019s dogs that was covered in artificial turf.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also stick with something simple that has a restrained budget. A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$40<\/strong> psf or <strong>$13,000<\/strong> for something in the 320 square foot range. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost around <strong>$18,000<\/strong> for the same size or <strong>$56<\/strong> psf. This material tends to last longer with less maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h5 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Other remodeling costs in Houston: Permits<\/span><\/h5>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of building permits varies from place to place. There are nine counties that make up the city of Houston. Each one has its own building permit system and fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eng.hctx.net\/Portals\/23\/FC\/fee-schedule-w-fmo-operation-permits.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harris County<\/a>, most residential renovations attract a <span class=\"s9\">$130 fee. <\/span>The minimum fee in <a href=\"https:\/\/mcgtn.org\/building-codes\/fees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s9\">Montgomery County<\/span><\/a> is <strong>$15<\/strong> plus <strong>$.30<\/strong> per square foot of your renovating project. Depending on your remodel, there could also be a plan review fee (half the initial permit fee), a plumbing permit (<strong>$100<\/strong>), and a mechanical permit fee (<strong>$100<\/strong>).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #333333;\">Santiago calculates an average permit fee when doing a quote for a client. He takes the square footage of the project and multiplies it by $1 and then adds additional fixed permit costs such as plumbing, electrical or HVAC.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy making your Houston home your own.
