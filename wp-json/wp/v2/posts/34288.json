Rather than putting any of their plans on hold, the newbie renovators\u2014and\u00a0newly\u00a0engaged couple\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decided to go through with the remodel<\/a>\u00a0before the wedding. Focusing on the kitchen and new flooring throughout, they prepared for a tight timeline. When the seller delayed the closing, Heather and Eric rolled up their sleeves to keep things on track. \u201cWith this delay, we, along with our contractor, had to personally roll our new kitchen cabinets across two New York City avenues!\u201d Eric said. \u201cTruthfully, we look back and are still unsure how we were able to sketch, design, renovate, and implement all of our changes without any background or experience in any of these areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31709 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Olivia and Greg's kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"first-time renovator\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olivia and Greg <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-co-op-reno-designed-to-fit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kicked off the reno<\/a> of their Upper West Side co-op while expecting their first child. With a list of must-haves that included the kitchen, two bathrooms, and closet build-out in the master bedroom, the couple learned to be patient and check on progress as often as possible to avoid problems later down the line. One smart tip they shared with us: identify a set of priorities and keep your eye on the prize. \u201cRenovating can be addicting!\u201d Olivia said, \u201cOnce you start, you\u2019ll begin to realize all the imperfections in your home, which could add on tens of thousands of dollars to your project. But don\u2019t get distracted. Stick with the original plan; you can always renovate again at another point.\u201d The couple\u2019s fierce determination helped them complete their remodel just in time for the birth of their son, Max.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32888 size-chrono\" title=\"Bellamy and Zak's kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-18-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"first-time renovator\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One year after\u00a0buying a 2,400-square-foot brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Bellamy and Zak found themselves <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">planning their first major renovation<\/a>. They relocated the rental unit from the top floor to the garden level and got to work on updates throughout the first and second floors. While staying on budget was critical in order to get everything done, there were a few things that Bellamy didn\u2019t mind paying extra for. \u201cNow that the house is done, I am so thankful we splurged on what we wanted\u2014replacing the windows, skim-coating, and repointing the brick; those are some of my favorite things in the house,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31301 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"gray-dining-space-natural-floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"gray dining space in a natural wood flooring and a dining table with man working after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ten years after winning the housing lottery for an apartment near Manhattan\u2019s South Street Seaport, Kate and Saul returned to the apartment with the intention of making it their home. With an eye on future resale value, they painted walls, replaced flooring, and remodeled the kitchen and bathroom. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-affordable-housing-co-op-hits-a-reno-lottery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Looking back on the reno<\/a>, Kate let us know that she didn\u2019t feel prepared for all the work that their contractor&#8217;s team\u00a0needed to\u00a0do on a daily basis. Another thing she learned: you need to be ready to explain what you want in each space so that the contractor can execute it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Lindsay and Roger's kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"first-time renovator\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lindsay and Roger replaced the cabinets, countertops, and appliances in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their co-op\u2019s outdated kitchen<\/a> in Ditmas Park. In hindsight, Lindsay said she wishes she spent more time deciding on appliances and included items like the cabinet hardware, faucet, and sink in her budget from the get-go. \u201cThere\u2019s always something you forget or didn\u2019t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval,\u201d she said. Plus, there might an unexpected wait to get plans approved. Lindsay said: \u201cIt took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33423 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Melissa's apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"first-time renovator\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Longtime renter Melissa became a homeowner after buying a 500-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper West Side. Once her offer was accepted, her boyfriend proposed (we\u2019re seeing a trend here!) which meant that the home would need some serious storage to accommodate the two of them. The solution? <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving\/\">Adding built-ins to every inch<\/a> of available space. To keep the custom storage from feeling bulky and making the apartment feel smaller, Melissa said: \u201cAll the materials were chosen with the idea of making the space feel larger, which seems to be driven by a more modern look.\u201d A simple color palette and clean lines allowed her to incorporate some more traditional elements as well, like pendant lights, the kitchen backlash\u2014reminiscent of old-fashioned tin ceilings\u2014and faux-stone tile in the bath.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Read the first installment in our series on first-time renovators <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
