The previous tenant had lived in the home for nearly half a century, and during a walk-through, Kim and Ian discovered that the original plumbing and wiring were in need of an overhaul. Challenges aside, the space was just the right size for the two of them and full of good vibes\u2014not to mention a fortuitous discovery in one of the walls.

Many cross-Pacific flights later, plans were made for a wedding in Hawaii and the purchase of an apartment somewhere on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where we could live together when I was able to escape court commitments in Sydney.\u00a0With both of us having\u00a0been married before with adult children, there was no need for a large apartment, but there was a definite need for the best use of a small space.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/IMG_5482-e1517858044570.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30576 size-chrono\" title=\"Kim and Ian\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/IMG_5482-e1517858032829-723x542.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"542\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>Sweeten homeowners Kim and Ian<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30486 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Ian\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30496 size-chrono\" title=\"floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The search for an affordable apartment was challenging to say the least. But thanks to the StreetEasy website and FaceTime (for my wife in Bayonne and myself in Sydney), a studio apartment in a 1915 co-op was located and purchased. The 450-square-foot space was previously owned by a retired nun who had lived in it for some 45 years (long enough ago to remember John and Yoko walking down the street from the Dakota apartments). The old girl (the apartment!) required a total renovation but had a good vibe about it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30517 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30521 size-chrono\" title=\"during\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(During) Laying down pipe for the island<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30487 mt-24 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given that I am from Sydney and my wife is from Bayonne, locating a suitable contractor was also challenging. After much Googling, I located the Sweeten website and was immediately fascinated by the Sweeten concept. So much so, that more out of interest than any real expectation, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/16664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I posted a quick job description<\/a> on the website and a hopeful (very hopeful!) budget.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With hindsight, I understated the renovation work required to a significant extent. While awaiting responses from Sweeten, I also contacted contractors I had identified from various magazines and other websites. Immediate ballpark quotes of $150k upwards from these folks sent shivers through my bones. Then interviews with potential contractors were arranged by Sweeten with the search ending in a coin toss between the two final contractors. After\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deciding on the Sweeten contractor<\/a>, who won out largely because he was both a qualified architect and builder, the renovating process began. The detailed quoted price was more than reasonable and way under $150k quoted by others.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30520 size-chrono\" title=\"during\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Right) Hidden window discovered<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30519 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"during\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30489 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I suppose it&#8217;s axiomatic that the design stage of any renovation is not ideal when one of the players lives mainly overseas. But as luck would have it, a trial in Sydney collapsed and I was able to fly to New York for a thorough \u201cwalk through\u201d with my wife Kim and our contractor after the building contract was signed. I had two absolute requirements\u2014a new soaking <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/freestanding-tub-bath\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tub<\/a> and new <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solid oak flooring<\/a> throughout. Kim also had absolute requirements: a nice cooking area and island, and new everything else! After weeks of to-and-froing, preparing and amending the plans, work was ready to commence!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that what was required was, in effect, a gut renovation of the whole apartment. Laying new oak flooring was going to require the removal of two layers of old parquetry flooring. Hidden in the wall adjacent to the neighboring building (a contemporary high-rise) were two old large windows from a time when the building next door was an old brownstone. Our contractor\u2019s eyes lit up at the sight, explaining how he could remove the windows and use the cavity space for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storage cabinets<\/a> and counter space, both considered premiums in NYC studio apartments. I am a lover of wood, and the contractor proposed the cabinets and doors be made of American walnut and mahogany veneer. The final look and function of both pieces of furniture\u2014a matching clothes cabinet hangs at the foot of the bed\u2014are terrific and make excellent use of an otherwise wasted wall.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30494 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30493 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"pull-out storage\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Plans for the main space involved\u00a0splitting the\u00a0studio into a cooking\/dining\/working area and a living\/sleeping area. With the kitchen island as the primary divider, the plans were fine-tuned, including a design for a reconfigured bathroom. To be effective, a complete <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-electrical-work-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rewiring<\/a> and re-plumbing of the whole apartment was required. This also involved breaking into the ceiling of the apartment below ours to put in new pipes and ball joints as required by the co-op management. Our Sweeten contractor did all the arranging with the downstairs apartment owner and diplomatically handled inevitable noise complaints. The guts were ripped out of the apartment and walls replaced.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30498 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT14-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30499 size-chrono\" title=\"TV area\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30500 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"storage cabinet\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The price quoted by the contractor to do the building work did not include the appliances, bath fixtures and other items such as tile, lighting, and flooring. We made use of various websites and sourced mainly high-end products, all of which when installed look fabulous and add value to the overall project. The sourcing and purchasing of items over the Internet was a real boon, seamlessly saving both shoe leather and thousands of dollars in cost.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Timing became an issue. Our contractor\u2019s hope at the outset was for the project to be completed within three to four months. But with the unforeseen need for the gut renovation, including rewiring and re-plumbing, the project did blow out substantially in timing. Waiting for the soaking tub (Kaldewei) to come from Germany, the kitchen feature light (Vistosi) to come from Italy, and the kitchen faucet (Franke) to come from Switzerland also prolonged the completion date by months. Luckily, we both had other homes in which to live while the work took place. Now that the work\u2019s done, the angst with the delay seems trivial.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30518 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before07-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT17.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30505 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT17-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30504 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT19-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"studio renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We finally moved into the apartment in early December 2017 when I arrived from Sydney for an extended stay with Kim in New York. Living here has been terrific. And I\u2019ve put the tub to good use throughout the very cold winter! The layout, feel, and livability of the apartment has exceeded my expectations. We\u2019ve had some teething issues with bits and pieces (cracked tile, cabinetry needing adjusting, painting touch-ups) but our contractor has been most attentive to fixing any problem that has arisen. I must say though, as a Sydney-sider, the street noise in NYC coming into the apartment is a bit louder than I had expected. But as one of Kim\u2019s friends said to me, \u201cSoak it up mate, it\u2019s all part of the New York experience.\u201d Let the good times continue!<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Kim and Ian, for sharing your renovation journey with us.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Cabinets: Custom.
