Are the walls bowed or the floors uneven? Are there finishes that need to be matched to existing furniture or flooring? Other site variations can affect the price.

The good news is you\u2019ll definitely find a style to suit your style and needs. Some points to think about:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Solid wood<\/b> is the gold standard because it is both classic and timeless. While solid wood is usually strong and sturdy, some types may crack, buckle, or shrink when subject to heat and humidity.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>MDF<\/b> is a good option when you\u2019re on a budget or if you plan on painting the shelves. It is composed of dried, pressed recycled wood fibers and resin. It withstands temperature changes better than many kinds of wood. It also acts as an excellent substrate for veneers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Plywood<\/b> is an engineered wood like MDF but essentially made of pressed sheets of wood veneer, which is why layers are visible along the edges. Higher grades of plywood are used for cabinets and shelving, while lower grades are what you might see in housing construction and subfloors. As with solid woods, you can choose different types of plywood such as maple, pine, or birch.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>WATCH VIDEO:<\/strong><br \/>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/M46pF7SpsME\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finishes for custom bookshelves<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">After choosing the materials, decide how you\u2019d like your shelves finished. Options to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Paint<\/b> is the go-to option. With this route, there may be a price difference based on the method of application (brush, roller, or spray), and the quality and brand of the paint you choose.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Solid<\/b> <b>lacquer <\/b>is a popular choice, which provides hard, glossy finishes that range in the level of sheen from clear to colored. Lacquer produces an extremely damage-resistant finish. It\u2019s ideal for projects that see a lot of traffic, such as low shelving in a child\u2019s room.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Varnish<\/b> is usually transparent but also comes in a range of glossy to satin finishes. Like lacquer, it produces a durable finish.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Unfinished<\/b> shelving creates a more industrial contemporary look.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">A lot of labor goes into producing a high-quality painted finish. (For a case study, read about the time and labor spent on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Kate and Arthur\u2019s DIY cabinets<\/span><\/a>.) The entire process can take up to five days and include up to four coats of primer and finish. Compared to two to three coats of a high-quality clear lacquer that can be applied in as little as one day. The additional labor costs easily offset the savings of less expensive, \u201cpaint-grade\u201d materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/custom-built-in-bookcase-home-office.jpg\" alt=\"Custom built-in bookshelves in a home office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-56425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/custom-built-in-bookcase-home-office.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/custom-built-in-bookcase-home-office-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/custom-built-in-bookcase-home-office-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>(<em>Above<\/em>) A <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/apartment-combo-upper-east-side-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">built-in desk<\/a> and shelving for Sweeten homeowners<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Site conditions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">The type of building structure you live in\u2014house, apartment, walk-up, or elevator\u2014contributes to pricing differentials when it comes to built-ins. Projects in apartments often take longer to deliver and install than those in houses. \u201cLabor costs increase when materials need to be maneuvered in a walk-up building,\u201d Ilya said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">In addition to the logistics of parking and unloading on a busy city street, some apartment buildings have strict work hours for contractors. This can limit the amount of work that they can finish in one day, stretching a one-day installation into two.<\/span><span class=\"s3\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Features and components of custom bookshelves<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Simple open shelving is the least expensive built-in option. Most experts don\u2019t calculate costs per additional drawer or door. However, the more features you include, the higher the overall cost. Glass doors or shelves, a floating desk, and lighting all add cost in time and materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Custom built-ins may conjure up visions of grand homes but, in fact, are great space-savers in smaller homes.
