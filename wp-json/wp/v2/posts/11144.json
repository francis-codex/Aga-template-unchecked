The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it\u2019s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor\u2019s calendar.

Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cBudget\u201d kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from \u201cbig box\u201d stores or IKEA. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMid-grade\u201d kitchen materials balance cost with quality.

The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000<\/b> per linear foot. There are many other factors\u2014drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options.

Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Building requirements<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Building boards \/ HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren\u2019t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>City permits<\/h4>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 \u2013<\/b>\u00a0<b>$3,500. <\/b>\u00a0Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 \u2013<\/b>\u00a0<b>$5,000\u00a0<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Electrical permits: <b>$900<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500<\/b> \u2013 <b>$1,000<\/b> <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The City\u2019s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building\u2019s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design\/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000<\/b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you\u2019ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">These \u201csoft costs\u201d\u2014expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen\u2014can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of\u2014this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000<\/b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Installation<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation\u2014if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery\/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the \u201cgeneral construction\u201d or \u201clabor\u201d budget and be handled by your general contractor.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Overhead costs<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor\u2019s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4521#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s6\">Sweeten contractor Thomas<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s1\"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. \u201cInsurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors\u2014especially plumbers\u2014have seen an increase in their costs.\u201d This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be \u201cmore eyes on the project.\u201d Additionally, he mentions, \u201cBuildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Raw material costs<\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class=\"s2\">Sweeten contractor Thomas<\/span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-05.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-cabinet-with-kitchen-peninsula\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-05.png\" alt=\"White cabinets with an open shelf along with kitchen peninsula after renovation\" width=\"1080\" height=\"551\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51064 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-05.png 1080w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-05-300x153.png 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-05-600x306.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC<\/h3>\r\n<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room\u2019s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city\u2019s permitting process, or with permission from your building\u2019s board. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ll be changing the kitchen\u2019s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you\u2019ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you\u2019ll almost certainly need approval from the building\u2019s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they\u2019ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves. Next, you should think about your wishes for appliance quality, quality of materials and fixtures, and overall finish level. Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring\/plumbing\/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions\u2014like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.<\/span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?
