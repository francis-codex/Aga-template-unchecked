They purchased a 750-square-foot Park Slope co-op knowing they would renovate right away and before moving in. They closed in April and had a move-in date of May 31; any renovation had to go quickly. But they were optimistic because the apartment was in great shape, and other than replacing the floors and updating the bathroom, there wasn\u2019t anything major that needed doing\u2013or so they thought.

In our home search, we had developed a pretty thorough checklist of what to look for at every apartment we visited: \u201cWere bathrooms properly ventilated?\u201d \u201cDid windows need replacing?\u201d \u201cWere the floors even?\u201d In this apartment, which was probably built in the 1920s, the wood floors were uneven and noisy. We knew we\u2019d have to replace them, and it would be easier to do so before moving in. Since we were going to be redoing the floors, we figured we might as well redo the bathroom as it&#8217;s hard to live without one in a one-bath apartment!

There was no subfloor. There was nothing but air between our old floorboards and the ceiling of the apartment below. No wonder it had been so noisy!<\/p>\n<p>Since the building was old, there was the added challenge of trying to re-level an apartment where everything had been built or altered for a dramatically uneven floor. We weren&#8217;t able to get it completely level. There\u2019s even a section of brick wall underneath part of our bedroom floor. From what? We\u2019ll never really know. The floor is still noticeably uneven in parts, and we&#8217;ve had to get levelers for most of our furniture, but it\u2019s much better than when we started.<\/p>\n<p>We wanted a wood floor that would bring some warmth to our home and be durable for years of Squib running back and forth over it. We selected red oak because I love how it warms up the space, and plays off the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exposed brick<\/a> of the fireplace. Our contractor was helpful in guiding us to a good stain and style of baseboards. (There weren\u2019t any baseboards originally, but we liked having something to transition from the wall to the floor.) We also did do a bit of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">soundproofing under the floors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38261 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5839.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38262 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5848.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the kitchen, we replaced the water-damaged wood floor with slate tile which we felt would be more durable.

We wanted something simple and crisp. It&#8217;s not a huge bathroom and we didn&#8217;t want to overwhelm the space. We chose a classic white subway tile for the walls and slate tile for the floor. While I love the look of a honeycomb floor tile, it\u2019s too hard to keep clean and grime-free. To break up the subway tile, we added a little black edging under the chair rail. Thankfully our contractor had done something similar on a previous job so we were able to see an example of it before committing!<\/p>\n<p>We also wanted to maximize storage in the bathroom. We kept a wall cabinet in its place and repainted it. Our contractor built a little nook in the shower, which we hadn\u2019t even thought of, but ended up loving! The storage under the sink wasn\u2019t useful because of the pipes. We compensated by including a large medicine cabinet.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38257 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, bathroom, renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5774.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38258 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, bathroom, renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5783.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38256 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, bathroom, renovation, shower\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5758.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One thing we didn\u2019t anticipate was how hard it would be to find a sink without faucet holes. Since our faucet comes out of the wall, almost every sink without pre-made faucet holes had to be specially made. As a result, our sink didn&#8217;t arrive until after we moved in, and we had to settle for a vanity with drawers that weren&#8217;t compatible with our plumbing.<\/p>\n<p>We are in the process of having a friend modify it so we can actually utilize that space. Here\u2019s a tip: vanities are unbelievably expensive and you can really only use the Ikea vanities with Ikea sinks, or it will take a lot of modification to make it work. Listen to your husband when he tells you that.<\/p>\n<p>But live and learn. This was our first ever renovation. In the span of seven weeks, we closed on our apartment, renovated, moved, and started working 14-hour days. We also got married in the middle of all this! It was so hard to source things in a timely manner and, instead of having fun looking at lighting or tile or paint colors, we just wanted everything done so we could stop making choices.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38263 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, bedroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/MG_5866.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The high-speed ride led to fun miscommunications like me accidentally telling the painters to paint both bedrooms deep teal because I actually forgot that we had two bedrooms and told them to \u201cpaint the bedroom teal.\u201d Looks like we have a painting project ahead of us.<\/p>\n<p>Our contractor was somehow able to complete the majority of the work in our accelerated time frame even after laying a new subfloor for the whole apartment.

The Sweeten blog was helpful for finding design inspiration and sources when the full scope of products available on the internet proved overwhelming. The Sweeten cost guides helped us create a budget.<\/p>\n<p>We realized afterward that it would be great to have two budgets, an \u201con paper this is what we want to spend&#8221; budget and a &#8220;we cannot afford to go over this number&#8221; budget. That way you can assess what will be worth the money and what you can scale back on if something comes up. Start sourcing things early, if possible. It&#8217;s better to get the thing you want early and move it around your living room for a few weeks then to not get what you want because it won&#8217;t arrive in time.<\/p>\n<p>We were excited to finally have our own space to make our own! I grew up on the campus of a boarding school so I had never been able to paint my walls before, let alone really personalize a space. We love our apartment so much and are so happy with everything. The bathroom turned out perfectly and the floors are much more beautiful and practical than the original ones we started with.<\/p>\n<p>Like every homeowner, we have many more projects that we will eventually want to do, but I&#8217;m happy we started with just the flooring and the bathroom so we didn&#8217;t bite off more than we could handle with our first apartment purchase.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Katie, Marcus, and Squib, for sharing your home, sweet, home with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>LIVING ROOM RESOURCES: Wood flooring: sourced by general contractor.
