There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.<\/p>\n<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/colleenanderic.com\/\">Colleen and Eric<\/a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1306\/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg\" alt=\"COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3580\/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg\" alt=\"COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1188\/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg\" alt=\"COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3538\/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg\" alt=\"COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kwhfurniture.com\/\">KWH Furniture<\/a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.<\/p>\n<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3587\/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg\" alt=\"KWH BAR CART\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1404\/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg\" alt=\"KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm5.static.flickr.com\/4019\/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg\" alt=\"KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1317\/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg\" alt=\"KWH VANITY\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm2.static.flickr.com\/1274\/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg\" alt=\"KWH VANITY DETAIL 03\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3332\/4609363461_74f96200a4.jpg\" alt=\"KWH VANITY DETAIL 02\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Sunday Jean, Becky and I visited Bklyn Designs, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople.
