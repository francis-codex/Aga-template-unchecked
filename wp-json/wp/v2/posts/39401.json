When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we\u2019d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work\u2014and learned what a reno here really takes.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early\u2014we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we\u2019d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"cooking-range-chimney-custom-cabinets\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48612\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-06.jpg\" alt=\"White and gray kitchen with cooking range and chimney on dark wood floor after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"dark-wood-floor-gray-cabinets\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48610\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-04.jpg\" alt=\"dark wood floor and gray custom cabinets in foyer after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-gray-kitchen-wood-floor\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48613\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-07.jpg\" alt=\"White and gray kitchen with brown wood flooring and open shelves after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">&#8230;we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope.

So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48627\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif\" alt=\"Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building\u2019s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn\u2019t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix\u2014for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">put a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/banquettes-seating-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kitchen banquette<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in every possible corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough\u2014designed as an eat-in when 24\u201d of counter space seemed ample\u2014but the two doorways weren\u2019t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48614\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg\" alt=\"Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"gray-foyer-full-length bookcase\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48609 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg\" alt=\"Gray foyer with full length bookcase and brown wood floor after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Giving the foyer a purpose\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that\u2019s only 8\u201d deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There\u2019s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors\u2014the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar\u2014then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-ceiling-white-subway-tiles\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48619 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg\" alt=\"Black ceiling with white subway tiles in bathroom with white tub and shower glass and white hex floor tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries\u2014and taking advantage of our building\u2019s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-white-bathroom-shower-glass\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48621 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white bathroom with shower glass and wall sconces and white bathtub after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-pedestal-sink-console-legs\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48623 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-17.jpg\" alt=\"White pedestal sink with console legs in a white and black bathroom with large vanity mirror after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-17-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn\u2019t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn\u2019t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-white-kitchen-wall-sconces\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-48624 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white kitchen with wall sconces and shower glass after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Finding the budget for hardwood floors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at\u2014and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile\u2014the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment\u2014despite disliking their color\u2014or redoing everything. Our contractor\u2019s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Becoming comfortable with flexibility\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York\u2019s interminable series of permits, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">co-op requirements<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and engineering reports\u2014paired with the inelasticity of old spaces\u2014meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you\u2019re looking for before you start to remodel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It\u2019s not the disruption that\u2019s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more\u2014it\u2019s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we\u2019ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like\u2014at least to our taste\u2014we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you, Jeremy and Chris, for sharing your Hudson Yards home renovation with us!
