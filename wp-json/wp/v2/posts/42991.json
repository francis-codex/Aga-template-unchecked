It was \u201cupgraded\u201d by family through the generations based on what was popular at the time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The result is a space that looks like it\u2019s been here forever. We were very particular in the materials used to create something humble and honest, which is core to what Porcelain represents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Elizabeth:<\/strong>\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">We inherited certain important elements from the movie set left in the space by Martin Scorsese\u2019s film\u00a0<em>The Irishman<\/em>. The linoleum floor and the bar, both imbued the space with an early to mid-20th-century feel and we decided to embrace that era, but, instead of an old Irish bar, we felt that, in keeping with the neighborhood, we would look to the rich tradition of Viennese coffee houses with a humble grandiosity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">We designed a space that seems to have nearly been unchanged for 80 years so that people felt like they had discovered a place that time had forgotten. One that had developed organically throughout decades, not designed last week and installed. The stenciled walls and tattered chandeliers bring a sense of ornamentation that has weathered the years and softened with age. The restroom is a bit more &#8217;70s funky, as though the third generation of the original owners had done some modernizing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a great source for antiques and decorative items in Atlanta, so many of the light fixtures, hand-blown glass cake stands, and upholstered furniture were purchased in the area and trucked up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42983 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-2.jpg\" alt=\"sitting area, Queens cafe \" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Mike-Coffee-Shop-Seating-2-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Mike:<\/strong> Navigating the construction process is a complete maze and working directly with a good contractor is helpful.
