Each demands investing time and energy, and often cash. How do you choose? Of course, we&#8217;re biased\u2014we\u2019re pretty sure Sweeten is the best option for high-quality remodeling contractors. But it\u2019s more than a casual opinion: we&#8217;ve sharing data to show how working with Sweeten benefits contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with a 2020 average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s why we think you\u2019ll agree:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Sweeten does the most thorough job of vetting leads.\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We weed out single-trade jobs and handyman tasks. We make sure the client\u2019s budget fits the project scope. You tell us what kinds of jobs you want\u2014your service area, your preferred project types, your budget range. We\u2019ll only send you the right kinds of jobs. We only accept projects with budgets higher than $15,000 with rare exceptions. Our average job value for 2020 was $67,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why we\u2019re different:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We protect you from wasting time chasing dead-end leads. You won\u2019t get this level of vetting from word-of-mouth referrals. You won\u2019t get it from self-marketing on social media. You\u2019ll get some of it from some lead-gen services\u2014but you won\u2019t get it all from any one of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. With Sweeten, leads are free\u2014you pay only when you win a job.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We want you to win\u2014because we only get paid when you get paid. We will never waste your time by filling your inbox with inappropriate leads.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why we\u2019re different:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You won\u2019t get a win-win arrangement like this from social media marketing. You\u2019ll get it from a couple of lead-gen services. Keep in mind that with social media, you pay for each click, no matter what happens next. Most lead-gen services sell the same leads simultaneously to many contractors\u2014they maximize their income while maximizing your competition. They\u2019re invested in keeping you paying, but not invested in your success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. With Sweeten, you\u2019ll be part of an elite network of highly vetted general contractors.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners will know you stand out from the crowd just by your Sweeten affiliation. They know that only 1 contractor out of 7 gets accepted into our network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why we\u2019re different:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No one else vouches for their contractors\u2019 qualifications the way Sweeten does. All of our GCs have cleared a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/vetted-general-contractors\/\"><span class=\"s2\">multi-step vetting process<\/span><\/a> that includes license and insurance confirmation, portfolio reviews, a 30-minute live interview, and conversations with former clients. We tell our clients all about it!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Sweeten offers you a true partnership. We\u2019re in it long-term to help you grow.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because of our win-win business model, we\u2019re committed to your success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We give you a dedicated account manager who helps with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/the-renovation-sales-process-a-step-by-step-guide-for-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your marketing and business development<\/a> on the Sweeten platform. You\u2019ll also have a dashboard that shows up-to-date performance statistics for your firm, offering valuable insights you can act on to win more jobs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why we\u2019re different:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You won\u2019t get any of this from referrals, social media marketing, or other lead-gen services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">6. Project photography<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There may be opportunities to take professional photography of your work and with the consent of the homeowner, the project can be featured on Sweeten\u2019s blog.
