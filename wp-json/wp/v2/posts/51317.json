They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pro tip:<\/b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\"><b>\u201c<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">With the lockdowns from covid, we saw companies cut production and manpower with the expectation that construction would slow down (which it did not),\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s8\">Dallas-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6958#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s9\">Sweeten contractor Joel<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s7\"> said,<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> \u201cand it took awhile to ramp up production.\u201d With a large influx of people moving out of the coastal cities and into the South and Midwest, \u201cthere\u2019s been an increase in housing demand making quality labor more expensive.\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s7\">Overall, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6896#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s10\">Sweeten contractor Kyle<\/span><\/a>, who is also based in Dallas, <b>\u201c<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s11\">Costs are going up in today&#8217;s current environment for: the whole home, the kitchen, and the bathroom.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">Dallas home remodeling costs per square foot<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A total gut renovation in Dallas that brings your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking, starts at <strong>$80\u2014$100<\/strong> psf. For a home that has budget finishes, this means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You&#8217;ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">As a guide, <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Joel<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> advises clients to tie the price of their kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of their home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value \u201cto really cap the budget at the return on investment,\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Joel<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> said. So for a <strong>$300,000<\/strong> home, aim to spend between <strong>$30,000<\/strong> and <strong>$60,000<\/strong> on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">Before getting started, general <span class=\"s2\">contractor Kyle<\/span> suggests homeowners research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don\u2019t end up with a budget-level renovation in a high-end area or vice versa. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2021<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li11\"><span class=\"s13\"><\/span><span class=\"s14\">A kitchen renovation i<\/span><span class=\"s5\">n the budget range can start at <strong>$10,000<\/strong> and reach <strong>$15,000<\/strong>. This would apply to a 75-100-square-foot room. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Joel<\/span><span class=\"s5\">. To keep costs down, cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next upgrade is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li11\"><span class=\"s4\"><\/span><span class=\"s5\">A mid-grade kitchen remodel in Dallas at the same square footage has costs starting at <strong>$25,000\u2014$30,000<\/strong>. What does a mid-grade kitchen look like at this starting cost? The kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for a new one and your old sink for a new sink. You can get a stainless steel sink with a single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.<\/span><span class=\"s15\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s5\">\u201cA kitchen with upgraded material and selections, as well as special additions such pot fillers, custom-built islands, under cabinet lighting, etc. can drive up the cost to <strong>$50,000<\/strong> and higher,\u201d says Sweeten contractor Kyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li11\"><span class=\"s4\"><\/span><span class=\"s5\">For an upscale kitchen that is 75-100 square feet, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at <strong>$40,000<\/strong>.<\/span><span class=\"s15\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from <strong>$50,000<\/strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were custom-made cabinets as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. \u201cAdding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen\u201d also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">There are plenty of variables in most materials, according to Sweeten contractor <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Joel<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. For example, with quartz you can spend <strong>$2,000<\/strong> or <strong>$7,000<\/strong> depending upon the quality. \u201cIt just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s12\">Joel <\/span><span class=\"s1\">advised.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2021<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><\/span><span class=\"s5\">At the budget level, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at <strong>$8,000\u2014$15,000<\/strong>. These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms at 35 square feet. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn\u2019t move, Kyle said. This budget won\u2019t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.<\/span><span class=\"s6\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"><\/span><span class=\"s5\">In the Dallas area, a 35-square-foot mid-grade bathroom can start at <strong>$15,000\u2014$25,000<\/strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about <strong>$22,866<\/strong> or <strong>$653<\/strong> psf with the same dimensions, according to the 2021 Cost vs Value Report. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.<\/span><span class=\"s6\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. More than 55 percent of your budget <\/span><span class=\"s3\">can be recouped in the value the project adds to your home.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li11\"><span class=\"s4\"><\/span><span class=\"s5\">For a high-end bathroom remodel and expansion, the cost can start at <strong>$30,000<\/strong>. This budget includes a three-piece bathroom (tub\/shower combo, toilet, and sink) for a typical 5\u2019 x 7\u2019 space. The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.<\/span><span class=\"s15\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,\u201d said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">2021 costs to adding outdoor space to a Dallas-area home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it\u2019s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a hot summer evening. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It\u2019s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A basic wooden deck will likely cost <strong>$49<\/strong> psf or <strong>$15,678<\/strong> for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the 2021 Cost Vs Value Report. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under <strong>$20,857<\/strong> for the same size or <strong>$65<\/strong> psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">2021 Dallas remodeling costs: Permits<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The upmarket suburb of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hptx.org\/179\/Fees\"><span class=\"s2\">Highland Park<\/span><\/a> bases building permit costs on square footage. The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs <strong>$490<\/strong>, according to Highland Park\u2019s calculator.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the city of Addison,<span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/addisontexas.net\/sites\/default\/files\/fileattachments\/development_services\/page\/10881\/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">building permit fees<\/span><\/a> for a project with a budget between <strong>$2,000<\/strong> and <strong>$25,000<\/strong> will have a base cost of <strong>$115<\/strong> with an additional <strong>$23<\/strong> per <strong>$1,000<\/strong> for estimated costs over <strong>$2,000<\/strong>. That means the permit for a <strong>$20,000<\/strong> mid-grade bathroom remodel will cost <strong>$529<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building permit fees in <span class=\"s2\">Cedar Hill<\/span>, southwest of the city\u2019s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of <strong>$400<\/strong> for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by <strong>$.60<\/strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by <strong>$.40<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy making your Dallas home your own.
