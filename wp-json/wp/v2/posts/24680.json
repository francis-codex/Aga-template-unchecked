Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make\u00a0an apartment a home.

It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24\/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it\u2026the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #d8bc3a;\">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the \u201870s, and one tiny bath you didn\u2019t want to set foot into\u2026we wanted our dream apartment!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24686 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment_Horizontal2-1.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment_Horizontal2\" width=\"999\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment_Horizontal2-1.jpg 999w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment_Horizontal2-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment_Horizontal2-1-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-02-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24782 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-02-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-02-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-02-1-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24684 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-01.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24688 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-03.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24689 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the \u201870s, and one tiny bath you didn\u2019t want to set foot into\u2026we wanted our dream apartment!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We love\u00a0watching &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/t221YNSCFLE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open House&#8221; NYC<\/a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw\u00a0an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/8578\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">signed up on the site<\/a>.\u00a0Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to\u00a0three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design\/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn\u2019t cheap but I didn\u2019t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-03-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24783 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-03-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-03-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-03-1-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24687 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-07.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24691 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-01.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen\u2014and built an 8-foot-tall <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pantry<\/a> into\u00a0the wall to the left of the fridge. Don\u2019t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It\u2019s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lighting<\/a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We loved the exposed brick in the living room\u2014which had 11-foot-high ceilings\u2014and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall\u2014if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building\u2019s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel.\u00a0We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/wood-flooring-cost-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floors<\/a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky\u2014Benjamin Moore Grey Sky\u2014and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations\u00a0of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren\u2019t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder\u00a0was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-04-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24784 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-04-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-04-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-04-1-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24703 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-02.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24695 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-04.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-During-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-10-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24699 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-10-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-10-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24701 mb-24 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-13-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-13-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-13-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-13-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-12-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24700 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-12-1.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-12-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-12-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cabinets<\/a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver.\u00a0The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to\u00a0better fit the style of the loft apartment.

I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx\u2014it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It\u2019s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vanity<\/a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I\u2019m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It\u2019s spacious and comfortable\u2014I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I\u2019m only 5\u20198\u201d on a good day. My wife\u2019s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/washer-dryer-apartment-additions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">washer\/dryer<\/a>! I didn\u2019t even have to ask what it was\u2026at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24788 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-Before-07-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24713 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-33-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24712 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-19-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-24715 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-31-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the master bedroom, we redid\u00a0the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows.\u00a0They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was\u00a0the best way\u00a0to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it\u00a0feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we\u2019re done, I\u2019d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don\u2019t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, Meg and Brett, for sharing your incredible loft apartment transformation with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Cabinets: original (repainted white). <span class=\"s2\">Emtek<\/span> cabinet hardware and crystal door knobs: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seclock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Security Lock Distributors<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0Carrara marble countertops and backsplash: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon.com<\/a>.<\/span>\u00a0Stainless steel Kohler sink: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.efaucets.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">eFaucets<\/span><\/a>.
