These were our criteria when we selected Crown Heights as our new home. A few years ago, we had moved out of the city to Long Island, but immediately missed our friends and the shorter commute. Janet, who runs the New York School of Design, a fashion design school, wanted to have input on the layout and fittings of our new home. So we decided to limit our search to townhouses that needed a gut renovation. We only looked at listings which included the term \u201cbring your architect\u201d\u2014you know the type.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39964 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-20161 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"photo-of-jerry-with-wife\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39987\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-1.jpg\" alt=\"photo of jerry with his wife after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1448\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-1-207x300.jpg 207w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-17-1-600x869.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After many open houses and a fierce bidding war, we were given the keys to a four-family brownstone that \u201chad good bones\u201d but needed a little TLC. During our initial walk-through as new homeowners, it suddenly hit us\u2014the prospect of such a big renovation was really daunting! We used <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service that matched us to our <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">architects<\/a>.\u00a0Sweeten also suggested three different contractors who each made proposals. We chose\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our general contractor\u00a0<\/a>and together, we got started.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of our townhouse renovation was to create the perfect mix of old and new. We loved pre-war architecture and wanted to preserve as much of the original detail as possible. During this process, we worked with our architect to think of ways to match the original detail with newer materials. We wanted to rethink the apartment layouts and convert the two-bedroom units to large one bedrooms. In addition to updating the kitchens and baths, we hoped that an open layout would feel brighter and more spacious. Due to budget and timing, we decided to renovate the four apartments in two phases. At the time of this blog post, two apartments are finished. We are currently living in one of them and preparing to rent it out after the other units are complete.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39968\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the demo phase, a lot of time was spent assessing what could be restored and what needed to go. The contractor tried to salvage the original ceiling medallions, but they crumbled once the nearby popcorn ceilings were removed. In the kitchen, it was a pleasant surprise when we found excellent condition hardwood floor underneath the linoleum. We were elated when we discovered that the stairways were in great condition and could be refinished (apparently, new stairs are very expensive). It was a rough day when we found out that the main supporting beam for the building (wooden and over 100 years old) needed to be replaced with a steel beam\u2014a big unforeseen expense. But we were thankful that the general contractor was meticulous\u00a0and didn\u2019t take any shortcuts in safety.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39974 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39970 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39971\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We had weekly walk-throughs\u00a0with our architect and contractor.

Next came the framing of the walls to create\u00a0the new floor plan. The layout is what really makes the apartment special. We joined the living room and an adjacent closet so that the entire area is larger. This created a small alcove, which is now a quiet sitting area bathed in\u00a0natural light. The living room then flows into the kitchen and dining area. Eight-foot French doors separate the kitchen from the bedroom. The doors, even when closed, allow more light to flow into the apartment.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The kitchen was very important to us. We like to cook, so we really wanted\u00a0extra counter space and built-in butcher block. Gray cabinetry and shelving were arranged to maximize storage space, and we incorporated mixed-material countertops, as well as a sink, fridge, and dishwasher\u2014all\u00a0from IKEA. We chose a counter-depth refrigerator, which fit perfectly into <\/span>the space<span style=\"color: #333333;\">. A geometric\u00a0<\/span>tile<span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0backsplash brings\u00a0it all together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39978\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39977\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-09-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39979\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bedroom is large enough for a king-size bed.\u00a0We kept the existing wall between the kitchen and bedroom\u00a0but converted the old kitchen into a dressing room. The dressing room is Janet&#8217;s favorite space. It has a huge closet, room for seating,\u00a0and a full-sized washer and dryer. The bathroom has two entrances\u2014one from the kitchen\/dining area and a pocket door from the dressing room.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The window moldings and crowns are all original. We decided to paint them black to contrast with the lighter wall colors. All the doors are original and were reconditioned and adjusted to fit properly. We chose egg-shaped door knobs. Picture rail moldings and new ceiling medallions were added. In the hallways, we restored the original wainscoting and created new panels to fill in missing or damaged areas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39967\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-05-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>(<em>Above<\/em>) Existing kitchen becomes the dressing room<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-39983 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/HnfD0a_qqfY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40064 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/GenPost-Embeds-BA-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"193\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/GenPost-Embeds-BA-2-1.jpg 975w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/GenPost-Embeds-BA-2-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/GenPost-Embeds-BA-2-1-600x119.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-39984 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The bathroom was also designed to mix old and new. We chose a sink and toilet that\u00a0would go well with the traditional fixtures. For added towel storage, we installed a separate rack. We chose to use elongated tiles, a twist on the traditional subway tiles. The matte texture of the hexagon floor tiles feels amazing on bare feet!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The building exterior also underwent a facelift. We first removed the &#8217;70s screen door and awning. The exterior cornice\u00a0was repainted black,\u00a0allowing\u00a0its architectural detail to shine. We chose a color called &#8220;Velvet Plum&#8221; for the main exterior. We splurged and replaced the front door with historically-accurate mahogany double doors. While this was not cheap, it\u2019s one of our favorite things about the building.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39965\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-Before-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-39981 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-39982 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All this sounds like a lot of work and it truly was. During the build-out phase, we had weekly walk-throughs\u00a0with our architect and contractor. I realized that this was very important and ensured that the project progressed smoothly. Even though there were detailed architectural plans and specifications, there were often\u00a0unforeseen circumstances that would require a quick decision. These meetings and open communication with\u00a0the contractor helped avoid delays and insured that the build-out was to our liking.\u00a0Because we watched as things were being done, we often gave last-minute input and even changed our minds about things a few times.<\/p>\n<p>For those of you out there who are planning to do a similar project, I highly recommend that you be involved. I know it\u2019s tempting to think, \u201cHey, I\u2019m paying these people A LOT to do this for me and I just want to see the final result.\u201d That\u2019s understandable. But, although it\u2019s time-consuming and a bit of a pain, I guarantee that you\u2019ll get a better end result if you are involved in the process like we were. In addition, your choice of general contractor is extremely important. Since this was our first renovation, we had put a lot of trust in our team. We feel really fortunate that our contractor was honest and didn\u2019t try to nickel and dime us on every little thing.<\/p>\n<p>Looking back, we really didn\u2019t know what we were getting into with such a big project (we blame cable TV renovation shows for misleading us). But, fortunately, with guidance from our architect and general contractor, the process ended up to be very positive.
