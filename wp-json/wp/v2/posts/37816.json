I&#8217;ve been in the construction business professionally for 12 years. As a teenager, I used to work on construction sites almost every summer, and that is really where I developed a love of building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0When Ilya started our business 12 years ago, he always leaned on me for inspiration and advice. Ilya had a construction background, while mine was in marketing and advertising. He\u2019s the expert contractor and I manage the back end of the business along with communications, marketing,\u00a0and social media. If you see a smiley face in one of our emails, I probably wrote it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya<\/span>: I have always been interested in things that allowed me to be creative. Even as a kid, I was a Lego\u2019s master! I went through culinary school in Australia, then jewelry school in New York City. I worked as a master jeweler, which is so similar to construction and building\u2014only on a much smaller scale. Ultimately I decided to pursue my passion for construction and building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0I\u2019m a big people pleaser, and I love nothing more than knowing that our clients are truly happy with the home that we helped them design, build, and personalize.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya<\/span>:\u00a0I love the process of being able to help take someone\u2019s vision and turn it into a reality for them. When I see the look on their faces when they walk into their finished home, it makes the hard work all the worthwhile. No two projects are ever alike which always leaves plenty of room for renewed creativity!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-35917 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"143\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-600x119.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit.jpg 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0Definitely all the red tape that comes with the management companies and co-op boards. I\u2019m the lucky one that gets to deal with all of that!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya:<\/span>\u00a0The biggest challenge\u2014besides traffic and parking\u2014is navigating all the different management companies, co-op boards, building codes, and permit regulations. These processes are a lot harder than they really need to be, but we always work hand-in-hand with everyone involved to ensure we have all the requirements going into the project so there are no delays along the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong> What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0Renovating is expensive and not as simple as shown on television! There can and usually will be surprises along the way, so it\u2019s always good to pad your budget by 10%, just in case.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya<\/span>: Pricing and budgets. So many folks don\u2019t understand how expensive renovating in NYC can be! And while Pinterest can provide some amazing inspiration, their budgets oftentimes can\u2019t support those ideas. \u00a0But that\u2019s where our creativity kicks into full gear and we get to suggest amazing alternatives and more affordable options for consideration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0The\u00a0Chrysler Building\u2014it\u2019s gorgeous!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya<\/span>:\u00a0My favorite modern building is the IAC building right across from Chelsea Piers, but my favorite classic NYC building is the Chrysler building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nina<\/span>:\u00a0Brooklyn Heights, especially the boardwalk with the view of the Manhattan skyline. It takes my breath away every time.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ilya<\/span>: Soho!
