In an older home that\u2019s been given new life, updated features sit alongside\u00a0quirky and charming details from the past, such as\u00a0crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space\u00a0while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes\u2014and the results are truly magical.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25404 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25402 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-11.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meredith\u2019s townhouse<\/a>, built in 1941<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-electrical-work-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\">electrical wiring<\/a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the \u201840s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here<\/a> to see the rest of this lovely\u00a0townhouse.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25408 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-Before-02-723x542.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"542\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25407 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron\u2019s postwar apartment<\/a> and home of 40 years<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/wood-flooring-cost-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\">refinishing floors<\/a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, <\/strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details\u00a0in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets\/\" target=\"_blank\">custom cabinets<\/a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\">built-ins<\/a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron\u2019s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making\/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here<\/a> to see the rest of Ron\u2019s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25410 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05-723x481.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"481\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-25409 size-chrono\" title=\"home renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"home renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Claudia\u2019s 1929 apartment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that underwent a mid-&#8217;80s renovation<br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment\u2019s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed\u00a0along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke\u00a0some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/interior-painting-costs\/\" target=\"_blank\">painted<\/a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled\u00a0the living room for decades. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2014<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inspired to take on the challenge of a fixer-upper?
