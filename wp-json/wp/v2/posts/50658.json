Rowhouses are space-efficient, compact, and often cost-effective. Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse comes with its share of joys and challenges. Sweeten lays out what you can expect with renovating these historic buildings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/pa\/philadelphia-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">What is a rowhouse in Philadelphia?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">A Philadelphia rowhouse is an urban one-to-four-story house that has a narrow front exterior. Rowhouses are attached to similar rowhouses on both sides.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Philadelphia has more rowhouses than any other type of housing structure. Designed as an inexpensive way to house Philadelphia\u2019s rapidly growing industrial population, rowhouses have become desired, premium properties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Some Philly rowhouses are quite large. Rittenhouse Square mansions can be as huge as 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. Most Philadelphia rowhouses are small to moderate in size, though. Trinities and Bandboxes (smaller versions of Trinities) can be as tiny as 400 to 600 square feet. Two-story rowhouses in Center City, South and North Philadelphia, and Manayunk can range from 1,000 to 1,600 square feet.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse: Challenges and solutions<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Because Philly rowhouses are unique, renovating them can present challenges. But to an experienced contractor, solving these issues is just a part of the daily work of creativity and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Philly-area-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6753#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten contractor <span class=\"s1\">John<\/span><\/a> calls his approach \u201cbob and weave,\u201d after a boxer\u2019s split-second, nimble approach to punches that come their way. \u201cRowhouses don\u2019t always need to be more difficult,\u201d said John, \u201cbecause we try to be flexible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">John cites his approach to debris removal as an example. It\u2019s no problem to park rolloff dumpsters in the driveway of a suburban single-family detached house; you just do it. But when a dumpster needs to be parked on a public street, all sorts of permitting issues arise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">John\u2019s solution is to cycle out debris every day. \u201cA hauling company picks up the daily load and some of my guys have trucks, too, so they can move debris.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Narrow doorways are obstacles to moving in building materials and appliances. Sometimes the old 30-inch doorways have been widened already. When they haven\u2019t, John calls this one of his biggest problems with rowhouse remodels. But he can always find workarounds by temporarily removing door trim or by unboxing appliances.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Ways to increase square footage in rowhouses<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">Squeezed in on both sides, the average rowhouse is fairly small. So, remodels need to be creative. Some contractors build soffits (or bulkheads) over exposed pipes, wires, and vents. However, doing this reduces space. \u201cWe like to avoid building soffits,\u201d say<span class=\"s1\">s <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6510#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten contractor Mario<\/a>, who is based in Philadelphia<\/span>, \u201cand most homeowners don\u2019t want soffits, either.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">So, Mario finds it worthwhile to reroute pipes and electrical through walls and ceilings. \u201cIt gives it a cleaner look and that\u2019s what people want.\u201d In some cases, Mario will push out a wall or ceiling a smidge. \u201cIf the ceiling is 10 feet or more, we might drop the ceiling just a little to run services through there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For homeowners who want more room, there is always more space to be had in the back or upward. \u201cPilot houses,\u201d says Mario, referring to rooftop decks, \u201care one of the most popular ways to expand upward.\u201d Plus, he sees some clients purchasing two adjacent rowhouse units and removing the wall between the two. This effectively doubles the rowhouse square footage.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Permitting and approvals for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">With most substantial Philadelphia rowhouse remodels, you&#8217;ll need permits. Any alteration that costs $10,000 or more requires drawings of the proposed construction. These drawings must have the seal or stamp of a licensed architect or engineer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Sweeten general contractors can refer an architect if the services of one are needed. Having an experienced architect and general contractor by your side will help you move through the permitting process more easily.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Not every Philly rowhouse is a historically designated structure. However, thousands of them are. If yours is one, you\u2019ll need to seek authorization and go through a separate approval process with the Philadelphia Historic Commission.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Check the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phila.gov\/documents\/philadelphia-register-of-historic-places\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">Philadelphia Register of Historic Places<\/span><\/a> to see if your home is designated as historic.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>4 tips for remodeling a Philadelphia rowhouse<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Be ready for costlier materials<br \/>\n<\/b>Renovating a newer home means that you can use a wide range of materials. Many homeowners can find off-the-shelf materials at the local home center to use. But historic Philly rowhouses have masonry, molding, trim, ornamental metals, walls, and ceilings of a more specialized\u2014and costly\u2014nature. Prepare by padding your materials budget.<\/li>\n<li><b>Be available<br \/>\n<\/b>Remodeling a Philly rowhouse isn\u2019t a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d project. Be available and responsive to everyone working on your project, including the architect, contractor, or project manager.<\/li>\n<li><b>Predict the unpredictable<br \/>\n<\/b>Prepare yourself and your budget for contract <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-conversations\/how-do-i-document-change-orders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">change orders<\/a> (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon). Change orders help your remodel project adapt to unexpected discoveries along the way.<\/li>\n<li><b>Rely on your experts<br \/>\n<\/b>Unless your daily job is renovating rowhouses, the experts you\u2019ve hired know more than you do.
