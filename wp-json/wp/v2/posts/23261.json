They initially discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn\u2019t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building \u201cright on top of the subway,\u201d he notes.<br \/>\n<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/floorplan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/floorplan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/floorplan-543x668.jpg\" alt=\"floorplan\" width=\"543\" height=\"668\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01\" width=\"720\" height=\"495\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980\u2019s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit\u00a0had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000\u2019s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of\u00a0counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn\u2019t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono\" title=\"Upper East Side renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This time, it was a real estate broker\u2019s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/5827\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted their remodel<\/a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor<\/a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June.\u00a0Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui<\/span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ght at the entrance. \u201cIt had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,\u201d Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple\u2019s design inspiration for cool mirror doors\u2014on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet\u2014that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white\u00a0oak floors in another project the team had\u00a0completed; Gall and Ingrid\u00a0instantly fell in love.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono\" title=\"Upper East Side renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T<\/span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the\u00a0new island where the wall<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> once stood. \u201cBy opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,\u201d he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/wall-ovens-power-heat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wall oven<\/a> and separate <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cooktop<\/a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into\u00a0a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In t<\/span>he master bathroom, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa.

For the nursery,\u00a0the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned\u00a0to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Upper east side renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"1058\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple\u2019s renovation. \u201cWe had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn\u2019t walk out on us,\u201d he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child,\u00a0and the job was finished before\u00a0the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thank you, Gall and Ingrid, for sharing how you organized and made your home work for you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Color Strip wood flooring in Natural White Oak: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.somersetfloors.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Somerset<\/a>.
