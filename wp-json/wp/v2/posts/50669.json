Historically, Carrara marble can be seen in statues and in large public and commercial buildings. However, Carrara marble is now more commonplace in residential homes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The core, or field, of Carrara marble is light-gray, with vague bluish tones. The streaks, called veins, are light-gray, too. The veins are slightly darker than the field.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The veins found in Carrara marble are subtle, not pronounced. Instead, they are soft, watery, or feathery. Carrara marble veins seem to continue and dissipate into the field.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41699 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a kitchen sink with Carrara marble backsplash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-14-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowners Tina and Andrew&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen with Carrara marble<\/a><\/span>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble is a type of Carrara marble. It comes from the same overall region of Tuscany, Italy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble tends to have a white field. Usually, the whiter the field, the more expensive the marble.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The feature that distinguishes Calacatta marble is its veining. Calacatta\u2019s veins are thick, bold, defined, and often colorful. Calacatta marble\u2019s veins range from dark-gray and beige up to darker browns and even gold.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta has few veins, but those veins stand out in sharp contrast to the white field.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Should you choose Carrara or Calacatta marble?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carrara marble<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners who desire the overall look of marble, but want a more understated look, should choose Carrara marble.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Carrara marble does an excellent job of blending into the room as a whole rather than calling attention to itself. Because Carrara takes more of a backseat, it can be used across large expanses for walls and flooring.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble is for homeowners who want to show off this unique, gorgeous stone. It\u2019s a marble that truly looks the way marble should look.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Because Calacatta marble is all about its veins, it is well-suited to bookmatching. Bookmatching pairs two marble slabs from the same cut so that adjacent slabs mirror each other. This gives the appearance of an open book.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Calacatta marble\u2019s distinctive veins make bookmatching possible. With Carrara marble, you can bookmatch slabs, but the effect may not be evident.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Calacatta vs Carrara Cost: Which is more expensive?<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Nobody can call marble a &#8220;bargain&#8221; building material. However, Carrara marble is far less expensive than Calacatta marble; around half the price.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-34229 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a renovated bathroom with Calacatta marble walls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowner Tatiana&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-family-affair-turns-up-the-style-dial\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bath with Calacatta marble<\/a><\/span>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pros and cons of marble<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pros<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Premium building material\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">High resale value\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Unique, every slab is different\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Natural building material\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Lasts long with proper maintenance\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Cons<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Expensive\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Soft, chips easily\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Heavy\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Stains\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Requires maintenance\r\n<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why is marble popular?<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">All building materials have their trends.

Marble is frequently the go-to pick for high-end houses with a classic or traditional style. It doesn\u2019t hurt that marble\u2019s history is rich and deep, as marble is associated with Roman buildings and classic sculptures.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Functionally, marble is dense, heavy, and permanent. It resists heat well. It\u2019s also more commonly found than one might think. Italy produces Carrara and Calacatta marble, but Spain, India, China, Turkey, Greece, and the U.S. also produce other types of marble.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45056 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a bathtub with Calacatta marble walls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Kristen-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Kristen-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sweeten homeowner Kristen&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/bathroom-renovations\/a-dark-chelsea-bathroom-goes-hollywood-glam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bath with Calacatta marble<\/a>\u00a0<\/span>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Best uses of marble in the home:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n \t<li class=\"li3\"><b><\/b>Kitchen counters: Use marble as your main kitchen countertop material.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Kitchen island counters: Pair the main kitchen counters with a slab of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marble on the kitchen island<\/a>.
