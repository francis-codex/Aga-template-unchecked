While undergoing a separate renovation in the basement, the family discovered water damage in the bathroom that needed to be fixed ASAP. The subfloor was rotting out from what they assumed was pre-existing damage prior to their ownership of the home, plus a slow leak. Marilyn, a veteran renovator and construction manager, also wanted to give the bathroom a cosmetic facelift to make it more cohesive with the rest of her house. \u201cI felt like my house was really modern (and totally my taste), and that bathroom was an eyesore,\u201d Marilyn said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-bathroom-with-pedestal-sink\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48884 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg\" alt=\"Beige bathroom with pedestal sink and bathtub before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>After<\/strong><\/span>: Eager to complete the renovation in time for Christmas dinner when plenty of guests would be in her home, Marilyn posted her <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/25914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project on Sweeten<\/a> and was matched with this <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/2803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor<\/a> early in December. They tackled the water damage first by reinforcing joists and demoing the rest of the space, removing the bathtub, toilet, vanity, and old tile flooring.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had initially debated replacing the bathtub with a rain <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/luxury-shower-systems-steaming\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shower<\/a>, but it was the only bathtub in the house (and one her kids loved to use). Instead, she set out to find a deep tub that would add to the luxury feel of the space. \u201cI actually had to get this special ordered, because it&#8217;s really, really deep and wide,\u201d Marilyn said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marilyn spent an entire day at the tile store, searching for the perfect ones for the wall, floor, and shower. \u201cI fell in love with the white subway tile, but I went with a gray grout,\u201d she said. Along the shower and bath wall, she opted for a gray gradient tile, and then a pop of color in the storage niche with a turquoise that ties in with the wall color. The modern <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-ikea-bath-vanity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vanity<\/a> boasts lots of storage for the smaller space, thanks to the large drawers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given her expertise and knowledge of the industry, Marilyn was very hands-on throughout the renovation and worked directly with her Sweeten contractor on finding, picking, and negotiating prices on materials. One of the biggest and only challenges they ran into was accommodating the oversized bathtub. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like jutting out past the wall a little bit, but he was able to get a nice little silver trim just so everything looks kind of consistent. We had to shimmy things to make it straight,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Marilyn-Ordonez-Bathroom-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment noopener wp-att-35620 noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-subway-tiles-on-half-wall\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48878 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg\" alt=\"White subway tiles on half wall with glossy brown vanity and white sink and brown wooden floor tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"brown-vanity-with-long-cabinet-pulls\"  class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48882 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg\" alt=\"Brown vanity with long cabinet pulls in a white and blue bathroom with dark floor after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The results were totally worth it and the project was completed just in time. \u201cI absolutely love it.
