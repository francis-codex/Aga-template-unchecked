Building a peaceful city oasis<\/h3>\n<p>When this homeowner\u2019s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building\u2019s management and an architect, with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a plan to combine them<\/a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.<\/p>\n<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/manhattan-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractor<\/a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">walk-in shower<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn\u2019t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovation costs<\/a> were well worth it.

Up against a wall<\/h3>\n<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom<\/a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.<\/p>\n<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">modern cook space<\/a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn\u2019t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractor assessed the options<\/a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. \u201cOur contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,\u201d Zoe said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg\" alt=\"Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><span class=\"img-label\">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Building one modern, family home<\/h3>\n<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">realize it needed to be renovated<\/a>, but also that the apartment really wasn\u2019t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.<\/p>\n<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating an open concept kitchen<\/a> and living area.<\/p>\n<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">renovation experience went smoothly<\/a>. \u201cKeeping our eye on the end goal\u2014creating a home we love for us and our baby\u2014made it all worth it.
