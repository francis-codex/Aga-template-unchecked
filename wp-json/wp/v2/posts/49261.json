Craftsman cottages. Stone or brick architecture reflecting French or English style. A particular Dallas home caught your eye, and location and neighborhood made it right.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you custom-built your home, there are probably some features you\u2019d like to change. Your home may need more efficient windows or the master bath could use extra square footage. Whether you\u2019re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it\u2019s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale value. The clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home\u2019s attractiveness to potential buyers. Here, Sweeten outlines some key tips if you&#8217;re remodeling a home in Dallas for resale.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/p>\n<h3>What improvements increase your home\u2019s value?<\/h3>\n<h4>Consider curb appeal<\/h4>\n<p>A home\u2019s first impression speaks volumes. What catches your eye? You may notice attractive landscaping, interesting siding, a statement-making front door.<\/p>\n<p>Replacing the front door in a Dallas home can recoup 63.7% of the job cost, according to <em>Remodeling<\/em>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/west-south-central\/dallas-tx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost vs. Value<\/a> report for 2020. This is based on a price of $1,803 for steel.<\/p>\n<p>A garage door replacement fetches 62.4% of value, at a cost of $3,600. That\u2019s based on a 16&#8242; x 7&#8242; four-section door with insulated glass windows.<\/p>\n<p>Re-siding a home with fiber-cement is a $15,881 investment for 1,259 square feet. You\u2019ll get a 64.7% ROI (return on investment). For the same amount in vinyl, expect to pay $13,425. (50.6% ROI)<\/p>\n<p>Another high-value project: replacing vinyl siding on the street-facing facade with manufactured stone veneer. The cost for 300 square feet of the bottom third, including sills and outlining entry archway, is $9,276. You\u2019ll get back 86.3%.<\/p>\n<h4>Replace windows<\/h4>\n<p>Sure, new windows provide aesthetics, but the main motivation is to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase energy efficiency<\/a>. Swapping out old windows with thermal windows has an ROI of 62.4% for vinyl and 53.9% for wood. Vinyl windows cost $17,101, based on replacing 10 existing 3&#8242; x 5&#8242; double-hung windows with insulated, low-E, simulated divided lights. The same amount of aluminum-clad wood (with wood frames inside) costs $20,884.<\/p>\n<h4>Refresh the kitchen<\/h4>\n<p>As the hub of the home, the kitchen may be its most important room. Its function is essential for daily living, especially for families and entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>A lower-end Dallas kitchen remodel starts around $10,000 to $15,000. A minor facelift can offer a high return of value:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Maintain the same layout (make no changes in plumbing or gas\/electrical requirements)<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Replace cabinet fronts with classic shaker-style wood panels<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Add new hardware<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Add a new sink and faucet<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Change out kitchen countertops<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A mid-range kitchen remodel can begin at $25,000. This is based on a 200-square-foot space with 30 linear feet of cabinetry and countertops. The ROI is calculated at 69.1%.<\/p>\n<p>Major kitchen renovations start from $40,000 and can recover 46.5% of the investment. The difference in features is the replacement of cabinetry and stone or quartz counters with an imported ceramic or glass tile backsplash. It also includes a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, wall oven, and built-in refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p>When updating a kitchen, consider current trends, but lean towards classic upgrades. This will assure that your kitchen has timeless appeal.<\/p>\n<h5>Other major kitchen improvements:<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Adding or expanding an island. This increases storage and creates spots for casual dining<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Adding a pantry. Existing or borrowed space may be perfect for a walk-in pantry. If you don\u2019t have space, a tall cabinet with pull-out shelves handles storage needs. Standard cabinets range in size from 12&#8243; to 36&#8243; wide.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Update a bath<\/h4>\n<p>Working within an existing 5&#8242; x 7&#8242; footprint, for example, will be the least expensive option. You still can replace the floor with ceramic or porcelain tile. New fixtures include a 30&#8243; x 60&#8243; porcelain-on-steel tub and a single lever temperature and pressure-balanced shower control. Expect the cost for a low-end bath remodel to be between $8,000 &#8211; $15,000.<\/p>\n<p>A more upscale remodel bumps up the square footage to around 100 square feet. Costs start at around $30,000. All fixtures are relocated, which will increase plumbing costs. Features include a double vanity with stone counter and freestanding soaker tub. A 42&#8243; x 42&#8243; shower with body spray fixtures and frameless glass enclosure also is included.<\/p>\n<p>How you customize your bathroom depends on your wish list. You can adjust your costs according to your priorities. Do you want a rain shower? Are you looking for a special color of stone or porcelain? Or maybe you&#8217;ve had your eye on a special shower or bathtub, which can pique the interest of buyers. A sculptural freestanding tub is a special focal point that makes the room stand out.<\/p>\n<h4>Add or remodel a powder room<\/h4>\n<p>Do you have the space to create a powder room in the main living area? If so, this can bring more value to your home. At an average of 18 square feet, you can splurge on some creative materials, wallcovering, and even bold color.<\/p>\n<h4>Expand your outdoor space<\/h4>\n<p>Outdoor living spaces have become an essential part of the home. Homeowners know the importance of being able to flow easily from inside to outside. This nationwide trend is equally strong in Dallas, a city ideal for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">entertaining al fresco<\/a>. Start by examining your available outdoor space. How can you use that space to create equivalents for how you live indoors? Seating, dining, bar and cooking areas, lounging, and spots for firepits\u2014all are desirable features to choose from.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the value of flora! Landscaping can beautifully frame your outdoor living spaces while boosting curb appeal.<\/p>\n<h4>Upgrading your outdoor deck<\/h4>\n<p>Building a deck in Dallas out of composite material (a mix of plastic and wood product,) costs around $60 psf (per square foot) or just under $19,000 for a 16&#8242; x 20&#8242; deck. The cost for a wood deck (equivalent size, around 320 square feet) is around $40 psf or $13,000. Porcelain tiles are another attractive option. They\u2019re freeze-proof and fade-resistant. Additionally, like composites, they require less maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>In Dallas, wooden deck additions see a return on investment of up to 92%. Composite decks average a return of up to 60%.<\/p>\n<p>A designated spot for a grill usually is in the plan. If you can afford the space and the extra budget, consider a mini kitchen. A built-in grill, outdoor fridge, sink, wine cooler, and even beer taps are among options available today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With the right help, remodeling a Dallas home for resale can be easy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No matter what your budget is, do your homework before beginning a remodel. Some key steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather inspiration photos to identify your likes.<\/li>\n<li>Examine your current routine. How do you use your indoor spaces? How can you use your outdoor space?<\/li>\n<li>Weigh the costs. What do you want to splurge on?
