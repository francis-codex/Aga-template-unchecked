March and April\u2019s fair days in the 70s are nice but they never continue. Average maximum temperatures in Dallas in July and August hit a whopping 96 degrees F. Your air-conditioner is the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">largest contributor to your energy bill<\/a> in the summer. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">While your own house will rely on that on the hottest days, Sweeten presents other avenues to supplement the A\/C. Alternatively, t<\/span>he best way to cool a house includes utilizing energy-efficient exterior materials from the roof to the windows.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All of these changes will help you prepare your home from Dallas\u2019 extreme heat. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Install a whole-house fan<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One way to assist your air-conditioner or even replace its operation on less intense days is with a whole-house fan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In your house, the lower areas below the attic are artificially conditioned to a set temperature, often in the low 70s F. As the day progresses, your unconditioned attic builds up heat. By the end of the day, it is at its hottest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even though your attic may be insulated, a tremendous amount of heat has built up. The lower areas\u2019 air-conditioning is working overtime to fight against it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A whole-house fan draws air through open windows and pushes it out through the roof. The attic is completely ventilated, as well. Many whole-house fans have an air exchange rate of up to six times the volume of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Speak with your contractor about the possibility of modifying the existing ducts of your HVAC system to provide whole-house cooling.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Best way to cool a house: Choose energy-efficient exterior materials<\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Paint your home with lighter colors<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most of us learned in school that lighter colors absorb less heat than dark colors. To a limited degree, the same idea applies to your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The U.S. Department of Energy has found that dark-colored homes absorb up to 70 to 90 percent of the radiant energy that strikes the house from the sun. Heat on the outside of the house can transfer to the inside, resulting in heat gain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Does this mean that you should paint your house white? If you wish to, you should do so. But any type of lighter-colored paint or siding color will considerably reduce heat absorption. These are creams and ivories, light tans, beiges, blues, and pastels such as peaches, lavenders, and greens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Choose roofing materials that handle the sun<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Roofs bear the brunt of the Dallas sun. Selecting the right type of roof can reduce heat. Up to one-third of the heat that builds up in a house comes through the roof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One common misconception is that selecting a lighter-colored roof will do the trick. Not so: a study by the U.S. Department of Energy found that even white composite shingles absorbed 70 percent of the solar radiation. Essentially, the roof is blasted with so much solar radiation, that the selection of color alone will do little.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One lower-cost solution is to have a coating applied to the shingles. Containing glass fibers and aluminum particles, this coating wards off radiant energy to a degree that lighter-colored shingles cannot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">More effective, though, is to choose a type of roof material that is less thermally reactive. Terra cotta and ceramic tiles, concrete tiles, and slab concrete are good choices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even metal roofs are good choices due to their built-in dead-air space. This space acts as a thermal barrier to block heat transference to the house below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Choose a siding that beats the heat<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The better insulated your home is against the heat, the cooler it will be inside. While in-wall and ceiling insulation are important, siding also will prepare your home from Dallas\u2019 extreme heat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Vinyl siding typically leaves a space between the siding and the house. Insulated vinyl siding fills that hollow space with a rigid foam plastic insulation. This insulation is permanently attached to the back of the siding. All insulated vinyl siding products must have an R-value of 2.0 or more. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">R-value is a unit of measurement for thermal resistance. Higher R-value numbers mean greater insulating efficiency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Masonry siding products such as brick and veneer stone help protect your home from the heat. Fiber-cement siding contains a great quantity of mineral materials, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Add continuous exterior insulation<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You cannot have enough insulation when battling the heat. While walls have been insulated internally for decades, a newer form of insulation adds even more of that much-needed R-value. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By itself, continuous insulation falls mid-range in terms of R-values\u20148.5 is considered typical for 2-inch thick continuous insulation. By comparison, standard two-by-four wall systems usually receive R-13 insulation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But the real benefit lies in its name: continuous. Continuous insulation severs those thermal bridges that draw hot air into the home. Wall studs or any materials that extend from the outside to the inside through the walls can act as thermal bridges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It only takes one view through a thermal imaging camera while standing outside on a hot day. Before continuous insulation, telltale blue ribs indicate the stud thermal bridges. After continuous exterior insulation, those blue lines disappear and your cool air stays inside your house.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Buy the best windows for Dallas\u2019 heat<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wall systems that are fully insulated are always the best way to prepare your home from Dallas\u2019 extreme heat. But no one wants to live in a house with no windows. Instead, buy the best possible window for that wall opening:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Double-paned windows are standard, no matter where you live. For maximum heat protection, choose triple-paned windows.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Look for windows filled with Argon gas.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Choosing low-e (low emissivity) glass is considered a must in hot climates. Low-e is a coating that blocks much of the ultraviolet and infrared light from the sun. By controlling these two types of light, you control the passage of heat into the house.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Get your numbers straight. For hot climates, keep an eye on three numbers listed on the window\u2019s sticker: U-Factor, SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient), and VT (Visible Transmittance). You will want a low U-Factor number, a low SHGC number, and a high VT number.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your exterior or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Install and maintain roof vents<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A whole-house fan pulls hot air from the entire house, including the attic, and expels it. Roof vents expel only air from the attic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ventilated attics can be as much as 30 degrees F cooler than unventilated attics. Chances are good that your home already is ventilated, and most newer homes are. The question is whether those vents are adequate for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For homeowners, calculating the number and size of needed roof vents can be difficult. Factors such as the presence of a vapor barrier, roof slope, type of roof, insulation, and more come into play. A qualified professional such as a roofing contractor can help with calculations and with installing the roof vents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If your home has a vaulted or cathedral-style ceiling or a flat roof, you will have no attic. With these types of roofs, ventilation works differently: the open plenum is within the roof itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">More ways to keep your house cool in extreme<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0heat<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Install exterior awnings over windows that receive the brunt of the sun during the hottest part of the day<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Install ceiling fans in each room. Note that ceiling fans rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. During the summer, you will want the ceiling fan to turn counter-clockwise.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have your yard landscaped to add trees and shrubbery on the sunny side of your house<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Add thick thermal draperies to your windows<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many ways to keep your house cool in extreme heat, from changes to the house siding and windows and the attic.
