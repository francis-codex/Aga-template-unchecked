Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining\u2014a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross\u2019 piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style\u00a0tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage.

We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood\u00a0and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen\u2019s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We hired <a href=\"https:\/\/thewhitearrow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White Arrow<\/a>, a friend\u2019s sister\u2019s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/14170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted our project<\/a> on Sweeten and found <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our contractor<\/a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: #d8bc3a;\">Creating a wide\u00a0barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for\u00a0New York, ended up taking about four months.\u00a0The apartment\u2019s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22092 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Pocket door renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-During-01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22101 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"blue painted wall\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"1083\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-723x1083.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22102 size-chrono\" title=\"Pocket door renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-09-10\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi\/dp\/B00AK2TMOS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Four Kitchens<\/a><\/em>,\u00a0a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the\u00a0sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22093 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22097 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04\" width=\"723\" height=\"1083\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22098 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.totousa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toto toilets<\/a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.archgrille.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Architectural Grille<\/a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22094 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Sweeten bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22095 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Sweeten bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02-723x1084.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"1084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02-723x1084.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22105 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Sweeten bathroom storage\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22096 size-chrono\" title=\"Sweeten bathroom renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material\u00a0work in the space. Contemporary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.graff-designs.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graff shower fixtures<\/a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22103 mb-24 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22104 size-chrono\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12-1-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-12-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love.
