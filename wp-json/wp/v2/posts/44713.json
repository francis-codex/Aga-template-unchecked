No matter the age of the structure, the first step in calculating the cost to remodel in Philadelphia requires comparing the renovation costs of what you want, to the amount of money you have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The age of your property will have an impact on the overall costs to remodel in Philadelphia. You may need to replace old wiring and outdated lead pipes, and, if found, asbestos would need to be removed. Other factors to consider are your tastes and whether you plan to change the layout, especially in bathrooms and kitchens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\">Sweeten<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has compiled a general guide showing the costs to remodel across Philadelphia, focusing on four renovation categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling<\/i>\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/middle-atlantic\/philadelphia-pa\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Cost vs. Value report<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Full-home renovation: Starting at <b>$75 <\/b>per square foot (psf)<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$15,000\u2014$30,000<\/b> for under 100 square feet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Mid-range kitchen remodel:<b>\u00a0Starting at $375 psf<\/b> or <b>$37,500<\/b> for a kitchen larger than 100 square feet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">High-end kitchen remodel:\u00a0 Starting at <b>$650 psf<\/b> or <b>$65,000<\/b> for a kitchen larger than 100 square feet<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000\u2014$20,000<\/b><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Mid-range bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$650 psf<\/b> or <b>$23,000 <\/b>for a 5&#8217;x7&#8242; bathroom<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">High-end bathroom remodel: Starting at <b>$735 psf<\/b> or <b>$46,000 <\/b>for a 7&#8217;x9&#8242; bathroom<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Basement remodel: Starting at <b>$50 psf <\/b>or<b> $30k <\/b>for a 600-square-foot basement<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What a home remodel costs per square foot<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten has found that a typical full-home renovation starts at<strong> $75<\/strong> psf. If you\u2019re embarking on a gut renovation of your home, and the mechanicals are salvageable like heating, sewer lines, electrical and plumbing, a gut renovation on a budget could come in at <strong>$110<\/strong> per square foot, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6510#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Mario<\/a>. This could mean choosing materials like a laminate or Formica kitchen countertop instead of granite, and shopping for fixtures from Home Depot. A mid-range gut renovation could be between <strong>$150<\/strong> and <strong>$200<\/strong> psf. Common materials at this price point include porcelain tiles, quartz countertops, and semi-custom cabinets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5980#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Bobby<\/a> (Robert) recently completed an extensive <strong>$100,000<\/strong> renovation. The client had found a piece of property they loved, but the house was too small. \u201cWe basically built a house around the existing house,\u201d he said. It included adding a garage and an additional living space as well as adding an extension to the back of the house to incorporate a larger kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When starting a major overhaul of your home, remember these big-ticket items that are often overlooked during budgeting:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">HVAC: A new HVAC system will likely cost around <strong>$8<\/strong> psf, according to Mario, who gave the example of a <strong>$17,000<\/strong> bill for an HVAC replacement in a 2,200-square-foot house. This impact on cost will be the size of your home and how intricate you want your new system. Increasingly, multi-level homes are moving towards having a thermostat on each floor, which can add a lot to the cost, Mario said.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Insulation: New energy codes have upped insulation costs by 25 percent, Mario said. Often, outside walls need to be sprayed with an insulating foam or fiberglass batt placed inside walls.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Windows: If you\u2019re replacing windows during your extensive gut remodel, then that will be a big cost. But it could also help you save money on your heating and cooling bills. Higher-end windows could cost up to <strong>$400<\/strong> each with lower-end windows costing <strong>$150<\/strong> apiece. Replacing 10 3&#8217;x5&#8242; double-hung windows with something that is insulated and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home\/\"><span class=\"s6\">rated low-E<\/span><\/a> will cost around $20,000, according to the Cost Vs Value report from <i>Remodeling<\/i> magazine.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note: While Sweeten contractors explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by trade. The prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44717\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1000-Project-Graph-Philadelphia.jpg\" alt=\"Philadelphia remodel costs\" width=\"765\" height=\"531\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1000-Project-Graph-Philadelphia.jpg 765w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/1000-Project-Graph-Philadelphia-300x208.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs to renovate a kitchen in Philadelphia<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$15,000\u2014$30,000<\/b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. A kitchen renovation using inexpensive materials could come in at as low as <b>$15,000<\/b>, said <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6130#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Erik<\/a>. At this price, you get laminate countertops, basic shaker-style cabinets and recess lighting. Tiling needs to come in at <strong>$2<\/strong> psf with a basic subw<\/span><span class=\"s7\">ay tile for the backsplash or no backsplash at all.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s4\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s8\">One trick to keeping a budget that small: consider a \u201crip-and-replace\u201d remodel. For cabinets, for example, you\u2019r<\/span><span class=\"s1\">e swapping out a 24&#8243; cabinet for another 24&#8243; cabinet. Another method is keeping your appliances and sinks in the same locations to avoid changing plumbing or electrical. Finishes such as flooring, fixtures, and appliances, are a great area to save. And the best place to shop for these items is at big box stores.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Mid-range kitchen: An average mid-range kitchen renovation is $<b>375 psf<\/b> or <b>$37,500<\/b> for an average size kitchen in the Philadelphia area, according to <i>Remodeling\u2019s<\/i> Cost vs. Value <span class=\"s2\">report<\/span>. The good news is with expensive areas like New York City pushing up that average, you might find Philly kitchen renovations are a better value. \u201cIf you stay away from custom, you can really save a lot of money,\u201d said Mario.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">High-end kitchen: The Cost vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/HW_Assets\/CVV_Assets\/2020\/Professional\/philadelphiapa.pdf\"><span class=\"s6\">report\u2019s<\/span><\/a> average price of a high-end kitchen of <b>$144,000<\/b> for a 200-square-foot kitchen or <b>$720 psf<\/b>. This includes expensive materials like stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, water filtration systems, commercial-grade cooktops, and vent hoods, plus a built-in microwave unit. A high-end kitchen that Mario recently completed had roller doors (think garage doors) on the custom cabinets that also concealed the fridge as well as a custom spice rack and pot and pan dividers in the cabinets.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs to renovate a bathroom in Philadelphia<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000<\/b> to <b>$20,000<\/b> for a 5\u2019 x 8\u2019 space with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Walmart or Home Depot. Bobby referred to this as a \u201clipstick\u201d remodel that essentially \u201crefreshes the area,\u201d he said. The layout stays the same, but you swap out old for new, including toilet, vanity, tiling, and fixtures. \u201cWe would not move anything as far as plumbing is concerned,\u201d he said.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">\u00a0A mid-range bathroom: This renovation in Philadelphia will cost on average <b>$23,000<\/b>, or <b>$650 psf<\/b> for a 35-square-foot space, according to the Cost vs. Value <a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/HW_Assets\/CVV_Assets\/2020\/Professional\/philadelphiapa.pdf\"><span class=\"s6\">report<\/span><\/a>. The example project included a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"s4\">A recent bathroom that Sweeten contractor Erik worked on came in at <strong>$25,000<\/strong>. It involved taking space from a neighboring room and extending the bathroom by four square feet. This enabled the addition of a washer and dryer. However, it meant a full layout change, adding a lot to the cost. The bathroom had some higher features such as hexagon tiles inside the shower niche, custom shelving and a vanity with a black granite top, which the client purchased themselves to keep the project\u2019s budget down.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">High-end bathroom: A high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$46,000<\/b>, based on a 7\u2019 x 9\u2019 bathroom, worked out to be <b>$735 psf<\/b>. With older homes, bathrooms with knob-and-tube wiring (which could be a fire hazard) and lead plumbing might need to be replaced. Demolition can also be more expensive because of the difficulty in dismantling heavy materials installed using old-building techniques.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Items such as a rain shower head can send a budget soaring because often they require more water pressure and a larger pipe to funnel that water through, according to Mario. Frameless shower doors, which are very popular can cost <strong>$3,000<\/strong>, which is double the price of one with a frame, Mario said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A master bathroom that Bobby is currently working on has a budget of about <strong>$285<\/strong> psf. This includes a steam shower with a vanity of niches for soap and a special foot niche to make it easier to shave. The bathroom also has a floating vanity with an additional vanity just for makeup. Wall tiles were made from glass and metal, which were difficult to install adding to the overall labor costs for the project.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs to renovate a basement in Philadelphia<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten has found that the average basement conversion in the Philadelphia area is <b>$75,000<\/b>. The project for this size budget includes a 20\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u00a0 room and a 5\u2032 \u00d7 8\u2032 bathroom with a shower and a bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to <b>$117 psf<\/b>. If your basement is already insulated and you\u2019re making mostly cosmetic updates, a starting point could be closer to <strong>$50<\/strong> psf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One area that can add a major cost to your basement renovation is the second form of egress, which is required by law, other than the doorway and stairs from the main house. If there isn\u2019t already an option like a window, then adding another way out could increase the budget by <b>$10,000<\/b>, according to Sweeten general contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A basement project that Bobby has in the works, which is part of a bigger, gut renovation, includes an ultra-modern floating bar with the exposed pipes in the ceilings that were painted a matte black to look like an industrial warehouse. There is also a gym area with wall mirrors that resembled a commercial gym. Because the basement was previously finished with drywall, electrical work and flooring, the cost came out to about <strong>$60<\/strong> psf. If those aspects needed to be completed, the cost would have increased another <strong>$20<\/strong> psf.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs for renovation permits in Philadelphia\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of permits can vary greatly across Philadelphia. While the city center is typically more costly, the permit costs for smaller jobs can be a bargain with the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/philadelphia\/renovating-philadelphia-heres-need-know\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Ezy permit system<\/span><\/a>, where non-structural jobs are processed. These projects don\u2019t involve things like moving a load-bearing wall which would typically require filing architectural plans to get permits. EZY permit applications only need a written narrative of the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For larger projects, Bobby usually puts a place marker in the budget for permits until the exact amount is calculated by a town\u2019s building department. These estimates are <strong>$750<\/strong> for a bathroom, <strong>$1,000<\/strong> for a kitchen and <strong>$1,500<\/strong> for a basement. \u201cIf the permits are less than the estimate, then we give the client a credit,\u201d said Bobby. \u201cIf it is more, then we will require more to cover that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Outside of Philly\u2019s city center, the suburbs can cost more and be more complicated. (But don&#8217;t worry, your contractor will typically handle the logistics!) Here are some examples:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lowermerion.org\/home\/showdocument?id=13278\"><span class=\"s2\">Lower Merion<\/span><\/a>, the first <b>$2,000<\/b> in the budget will cost <b>$87.50<\/b>. From <b>$2,001<\/b> up to <b>$50,000<\/b> in the budget, you will get charged an additional <b>$15<\/b> per <b>$1,000<\/b> of planned work. From <b>$50,000<\/b> to <b>$300,000<\/b> in renovations, the cost is <b>$12<\/b> per <b>$1,000<\/b>. Anything above <b>$300,000<\/b> is <b>$5<\/b> per <b>$1,000<\/b> in the budget.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s4\">In the city neighborhood of <a href=\"https:\/\/business.phila.gov\/media\/Summary-of-Building-Permit-Fees.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">Bella Vista<\/span><\/a>, the cost of building permits is linked to your square footage. A residential renovation under 500 square feet will cost <b>$50<\/b> for one- and two-family homes and <b>$150<\/b> for all others. A structure over 500 square feet in a one- and two-family space will cost<b> $50<\/b> plus <b>$40<\/b> per additional 100 square feet or any fraction above 500. All other homes cost <b>$150<\/b> plus <b>$40<\/b> per each additional 100 square feet or any fraction over 500.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>A Rowhouse Remodel in Bella Vista<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All of these facts and figures are a starting point for pulling together an initial budget for a Philadelphia renovation.
