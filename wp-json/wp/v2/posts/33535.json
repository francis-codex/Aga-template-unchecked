Luckily for you, we\u2019ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories\u2014cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling\u2019s<\/em> 2023 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2023\/middle-atlantic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost vs. Value report<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)<\/strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000<\/strong> for under 100 square feet<\/li>\n<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000\u2014$75,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000\u2014$40,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000\u2014$100,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000\u2014$100,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.southamptontownny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Town of Southampton<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/ehamptonny.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Town of East Hampton<\/a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.<\/p>\n<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class=\"s1\">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"40\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot<\/h3>\n<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Westchester County<\/a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot<\/strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf<\/strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf<\/strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000<\/strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot<\/a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. \u201cBuilding materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-cost-guides\/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition\/\">Costs for a kitchen renovation<\/a><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000<\/strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000\u2014$75,000<\/strong>.

Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000<\/strong> for high-end finishes.

According to Remodeling\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2023\/middle-atlantic\/new-york-ny\/?bwts=1692367227\"><span class=\"s2\">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report<\/span><\/a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223<\/strong> in New York. This is based on expanding an existing 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, relocating all fixtures, and installing a new shower with a frameless glass enclosure, freestanding soaker tub with high-end faucets, stone counters with dual sinks, one-piece toilet, and a humidistat-controlled exhaust fan.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000<\/strong> on average.<\/p>\n<h3>Costs for a basement renovation<\/h3>\n<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/category\/sweeten-renovations\/basement-renovations\/\">basement remodels<\/a> budgeted at <strong>$100\u2014$150 psf<\/strong> or <strong>$25,000<\/strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000\u2014$100,000<\/strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons<\/h3>\n<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation\/\">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects<\/a> elsewhere.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Environmental consultants<\/strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home\/\">delicate ecosystems<\/a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350\/hour<\/strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. <\/strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Local attorneys<\/strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys\u2019 fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements<\/h3>\n<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don\u2019t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won\u2019t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href=\"https:\/\/ehamptonny.gov\/DocumentCenter\/View\/2224\/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> a change in the energy conservation requirements<\/a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000\u2014$2,000<\/strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.<\/p>\n<p>The Town of Southampton provides this handy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.southamptontownny.gov\/DocumentCenter\/View\/4178\/Interior-RenovationsAlterations-PDF?bidId=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building Permit Application Checklist<\/a> for residential interior renovations (note that different fees and applications are required for other types of construction).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.southamptontownny.gov\/DocumentCenter\/View\/599\/Building-Zoning-Fee-Schedule--Residential-PDF?bidId=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building permits<\/a> for residential interior remodeling permits run <strong>$65 psf<\/strong> up to <strong>2,000 square feet<\/strong> on the first story of a house with a <strong>$50<\/strong> fee for up to<strong> $1,000<\/strong> of estimated construction cost (ECC).<\/li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.southamptontownny.gov\/DocumentCenter\/View\/600\/Electrical-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrical Permit Fee Schedule<\/a> indicates that electrical permits range from a minimum of <strong>$50<\/strong> for a re-inspection to <strong>$1,000<\/strong> for additions, renovations, basement wiring, and garages with more than 7 devices over 15,000 square feet.<\/li>\n<li>Fees for plumbing fixtures are <strong>$5<\/strong> per fixture with a <strong>$50<\/strong> minimum.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Ready to start planning your Hamptons renovation?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-46403 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/CTA-PostRenovation.png\" alt=\"Post A Renovation Project\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now that you understand typical Hamptons renovation costs, you can start the planning process!
