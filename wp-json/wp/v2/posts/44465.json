Your backyard or side yard can offer a paradise of fresh air, natural light, plants, and flowers. Outdoor decks tie these two living spaces while also adding to the value of your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Think of a deck as the perfect connection from inside to outside. An outdoor deck elevates users from the ground and provides a unique view of your property and beyond. Decks also can be a centerpiece of outdoor social life, a gathering place for barbecues, parties, or even restful solitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDecks are a great way to add space to your property,\u201d said New Jersey-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5408#overview\"><span class=\"s2\">Sweeten general contractor Chris<\/span><\/a>. \u201cBy extending your outdoor living seasons, they basically make your home larger.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Sweeten<\/span><\/a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, explains what you need to know about building or renovating an outdoor deck.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Types of outdoor decks<\/h3>\n<h4><b>Freestanding<\/b> outdoor decks<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Freestanding decks, also called floating or ground-level decks, hug closer to grade than attached decks. You can build these decks alongside the house or anywhere within the yard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many municipalities don&#8217;t require building permits for outdoor deck designs less than a certain height above grade (often 30 inches) and not built over a basement or lower story. The deck area may not be part of an accessible route to either of these lower areas. The deck should still follow all applicable building codes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Attached or fixed<\/b> decks<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Attached, or fixed, decks are more elaborate structures than freestanding decks. They may be taller, require special footings, use guards and handrails, and attach to the home with a ledger board. Because this deck design is complex, most homeowners will hire a contractor or other professional to build an attached deck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Attached decks better integrate with the home, compared to freestanding decks. Maxx, a designer for <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6267#overview\"><span class=\"s2\">this Sweeten general contractor in Chicago<\/span><\/a>, said that his company aims to blur the line between inside and outside. \u201cWe allow the exterior to be an extension of the indoors,\u201d he said, \u201cand we like to have the indoor flow to the outside so that it doesn\u2019t feel like an appendage.

Although code requirements may determine lower decking materials, there are several options available for the top deck. One way to renovate a deck is to remove old deck materials from an existing deck and replace them. This method reduces costs since the entire outdoor decking structure does not need to be rebuilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Composites: <\/b>Most composite material is made of recycled plastics and wood fibers. Wood composite is a popular material due to its softness underfoot and durability. Wood composite decks don&#8217;t ever need staining or sealing. However, colors can fade over time, especially in sunnier areas. While composites are low-maintenance, they are not maintenance-free. Like other outdoor decking materials, you must periodically clean composite wood of moss, mold, and mildew, especially if the deck is in shade.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Fiberglass:&nbsp;<\/b>\u201cFiberglass deck material is very popular now,\u201d said Chris. \u201cIt can be painted or stained and it lasts forever.\u201d Slip-resistant fiberglass panels overlap to form a continuous solid surface, which is beneficial when decking over a lower area needs to stay dry. Fiberglass deck panels do not rot, rust, or harbor mildew; which makes this material ideal for high-moisture conditions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Tropical hardwoods:&nbsp;<\/b>Ipe and tigerwood are two common species of tropical hardwoods used for decking materials. These dense woods are difficult to cut and drill, but their density means that the deck\u2019s longevity will beat that of pressure-treated wood, redwood, and cedar. Because of their natural fire resistance, building codes may allow some tropical hardwoods in situations where other woods aren&#8217;t an option. Tropical hardwoods are expensive\u2014but they may help both the deck and the home maintain value over the years, even into resale.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Redwood and cedar:&nbsp;<\/b>Redwood and cedar are softwoods mainly sourced from western states. These materials are a good compromise between expensive tropical hardwoods and pressure-treated wood. These kinds of wood are imbued with natural tannins and oils, and do not require chemical preservatives.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pressure-treated wood:&nbsp;<\/b>The most economical choice is pressure-treated wood. Southern yellow pine, which is pressure-injected with chemicals that help the wood resist rot and wood-boring insects, is popular. One disadvantage to pressure-treated wood decking is that the wood splinters easily and isn&#8217;t safe for walking on with bare feet. Be sure to always coat pressure-treated deck materials on top to extend their durability. Because of these issues, Sweeten contractor Chris says that pressure-treated wood has become less popular for upper deck materials, though it is always used for the lower structure.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">What is the best time to build an outdoor deck?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Inclement weather will complicate any building project. Tarping the deck during rain or snow may improve conditions during construction, but it&#8217;s usually easier for crews to work without a cover. Frozen ground can slow digging. Late spring to mid-fall is the most comfortable and efficient time to build or renovate. Nevertheless, most deck builders work year-round. The trick to working through all seasons, said Chris, is to dig the holes for the footers in advance\u2014before the ground freezes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44502 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton.jpg\" alt=\"outdoor deck hamptons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Outdoor-deck_bridgehampton-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\" style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Renovation in Bridgehampton, NY by <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4287#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: #76808f;\">Sweeten general contractor John<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How much does it cost to build an outdoor deck?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The average national cost for a deck addition is $14,360, according to <i>Remodeling<\/i>\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Cost vs Value<\/span><\/a> report. A composite deck returns 66.8% of its cost in added home value, while a wood deck returns 72.1%. Premium decks with full-service features, similar to all-purpose outdoor entertainment areas, can range up to 2,000 square feet in suburban areas. Deck sizes in downtown areas tend to be smaller (between 70 to 120 square feet), but the decks are often higher and with multiple levels. Costs can range from $40,000 to $60,000, increasing with extra features. For example, when a deck extends and includes larger amenities, like a swimming pool, costs can exceed $100,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Facini,&nbsp; deck-building costs are highly variable. They depend on factors like decking materials, condition of the site, grade, number of decks and their height, plus special items like glass railings. Generally, you can expect decking material to cost around $20 to $30 per square foot for composites or tropical hardwoods like teak. Overall, total costs generally range from $25,000 to $30,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Beginning to build your ideal outdoor deck<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Decks bring joy to so many homeowners by expanding their living and entertaining area, and by offering such practical access to the outdoors.

Next, the builder draws up blueprints and prices out materials to generate a solid cost estimate for the project. The builder submits the deck plans to the building department. City technicians visit and mark the site to ensure that any digging doesn\u2019t damage underground services. String is placed around the outline of the deck, and any necessary sod is removed. The position of the piers and footers is established and then the builders create the deck. They dig the holes; set the piers and footers; install the ledger board on the house; install the posts, beams, and joists. Then the decking boards are attached and trimmed. They add additional features, such as stairs and railings. If needed, they stain the deck and seal it for weather resistance.","inLanguage":"en-US"},"inLanguage":"en-US"},{"@type":"Question","@id":"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck\/#faq-question-1640064045532","position":2,"url":"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck\/#faq-question-1640064045532","name":"How much does an outdoor deck cost?","answerCount":1,"acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Costs to build an outdoor deck are highly variable.
