Curb appeal provides the\u00a0critical first impression to prospective buyers,\u00a0creating the desire\u00a0to step inside and see more\u2014or to keep on driving.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another advantage to\u00a0strong curb appeal is that it makes for a\u00a0pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at\u00a0homes online and the first photo\u00a0from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curb appeal\u00a0involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved\u2014if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed\u2014and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Majid<\/a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that\u00a0specific look.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono\" title=\"brownstone\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg\" alt=\"curb appeal\" width=\"723\" height=\"542\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>Landscaping project by <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten landscape designer Brook<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive\u00a0their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3251\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten<\/a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust\u2014a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l<\/strong><strong>andscaping<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and\u00a0its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a\u00a0kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work\u00a0provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono\" title=\"house\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg\" alt=\"curb appeal\" width=\"723\" height=\"407\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>Landscape\u00a0project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city.\u00a0Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. \u201cMore labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,\u201d explained Kyle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the \u201cblacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Realtors&#8217;<\/a>\u00a02017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remodeling<\/a><\/em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their\u00a0audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value.\u00a0Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smaller-scale projects\u00a0run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono\" title=\"Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg\" alt=\"curb appeal\" width=\"723\" height=\"815\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Entry door replacements<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but\u00a0keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was\u00a0#1,\u00a0followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.<\/p>\n<h4>Roofing, siding, windows<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket\u00a0undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono\" title=\"house\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"curb appeal\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>Renovation by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor Bud<\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to achieve that \u201cwelcome factor\u201d you need for a successful resale?
