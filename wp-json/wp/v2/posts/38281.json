When do you bring in the architect and general contractor?<\/p>\n<p>Here, Sweeten offers a practical guide to juggling a purchase PLUS a renovation. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/1000px-Graph-Timeline-new.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here<\/a> to download our guide.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Bidding on the home you want<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Speak with a mortgage broker or lender<\/strong><\/span> (1 \u2013 3 weeks) Determine how you want to pay for your renovation. A construction-to-permanent loan allows you to finance your renovation as part of your mortgage application in one go versus two separate processes.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Hire a real estate attorney<\/strong><\/span> (3 days \u2013 2 weeks)<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Find your new home and make an offer<\/strong><\/span> (1 \u2013 4 months) Take into consideration how much of a reno budget you\u2019ll have after the purchase. On the reno front, decide the time\/budget of what you can afford. (Don\u2019t forget about closing costs; your agent and attorney can guide you on the cost range.) Keep in mind how long you want to carry a property after closing. You will most likely be paying for housing elsewhere unless you plan on roughing it in the unrenovated space.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Negotiate the offer<\/span><\/strong> (2 days \u2013 2 weeks) In the meantime, read up on how much labor and materials cost, along with the average home renovation costs on Sweeten&#8217;s blog. You can get a head start filling out your <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">project details on Sweeten<\/a> to better understand what you need. ie) alteration agreement, building insurance requirements, space dimensions for the renovation). Then, post your project after you close on your property.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Inspect and sign the contract<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Schedule and conduct an inspection<\/span><\/strong>, if applicable. In a competitive market, this is a contingency a buyer may choose to forgo to make their bid more attractive. This can also be done while negotiating the offer (1 \u2013 2 days). If you\u2019re buying to renovate, you\u2019ll want to know what will be possible to change, given existing conditions. You may not care whether the appliances are working or if the walls are orange. However, you\u2019ll want to know about the state of the electrical and plumbing systems and if upgrading them is possible. The inspection will provide additional insight into the condition of the apartment and the building.<\/li>\n<li>If you plan on moving walls, you\u2019ll need an architect or a designer.<\/li>\n<li>Get a heads-up about other financial or building issues. If the inspector tells you the apartment building needs a new roof or boiler, for example, look into whether there will be an assessment levied or if money has already been raised. With an assessment, you\u2019ll bear the expense as the new owner. This may cut into your renovation budget. The same goes for a house: if there are pressing repairs, you\u2019ll foot the whole bill.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Have your attorney conduct due diligence<\/span><\/strong> (2 weeks) At the same time, the attorney should also review the alteration agreement to make sure nothing prohibits you from the vision you have planned.\u00a0ie) Checking the wet-over-dry rules if you plan to relocate the kitchen.<\/li>\n<li>In a house, be certain zoning will allow the renovation plans you have. ie) If you\u2019re in a landmarked district, you\u2019ll be restricted in what you can do to the home\u2019s exterior.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Start your general contractor search<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sign the contract to your new home<\/span><\/strong> (5 \u2013 7 business days) Now\u2019s the time to post your renovation project to Sweeten with details about your wish list, budget, and timeline.

You&#8217;ll want the contractor to start immediately after your closing date.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Board approval and begin your renovation<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meet for a board interview<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0(this can take anywhere from 1 week to a few months).<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Receive board approval<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0(again, be prepared for a wait time from 1 week to a few months after the board interview).<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Schedule a closing<\/span><\/strong> (2 weeks after approval). Once your closing is scheduled, let your general contractor know so that room can be made in the schedule for your project to begin.

If you\u2019re in a condo or co-op, you\u2019ll also need to get the renovation approved by the board.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When buying and renovating a fixer-upper, some overlap exists between your renovation and your property purchase schedules. The bulk of the renovation process that happens prior to closing is prep work. Use this time to educate yourself about costs and processes. Begin the search for contractors and who would be the best fit for your project.<\/p>\n<p>While you can lay this groundwork, don\u2019t pull the trigger until you own the property (you never know what might happen!). <span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
