It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech\u2019s skill at automation, it\u2019s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href=\"https:\/\/cta.tech\/Resources\/i3-Magazine\/i3-Issues\/2020\/January-February\/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology\"> <span class=\"s2\">70-percent of homes<\/span><\/a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart water heaters and controllers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don\u2019t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you\u2019ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart water heaters connect to your home\u2019s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater\u2019s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there\u2019s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart connected appliances<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do all of your home\u2019s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/products\/smart_home_tips\"> <span class=\"s2\">EnergyStar<\/span><\/a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a two-part system. One, you\u2019ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you\u2019ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">EnergyStar\u2019s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart home security systems<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For a long time, \u201csmart\u201d was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart radiant wall heating<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system\u2019s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you\u2019d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart water monitors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home\u2019s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home\u2019s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Smart garage door openers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Check out Sweeten&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">women-owned and women-operated general contracting firms<\/a> in our five-part series.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
