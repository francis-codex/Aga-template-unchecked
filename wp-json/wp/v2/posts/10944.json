You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost for a gut renovation vs. a non-gut<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As you <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plan out your home remodel<\/a>, there\u2019s a difference in cost, process, and scope between a gut and non-gut project. <span class=\"s1\">In a gut renovation, interior walls are stripped down to the studs or knocked out entirely.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A gut will start at the higher end of the <b>$100 <\/b>to<b> $200 psf <\/b>range, while a renovation in which you redo the space within the existing walls will be on the lower end. For example, in a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, a renovation will come in around the <b>$50,000<\/b> to <b>$70,000<\/b> range, while a gut renovation will likely exceed <b>$100,000<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The non-gut renovation may involve a new kitchen and bath, as well as refinishing flooring, replastering and <span class=\"s2\">painting<\/span>, plus upgrades in materials and finishes. The gut renovation will include the above as well as replacing the walls and flooring, and possibly installing new piping and wiring systems and moving doorways.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-49030 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg\" alt=\"NYC renovation costs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/GutOrNoGutReno-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/GutOrNoGutReno-1-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/GutOrNoGutReno-1-600x447.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Given that New York City apartments vary widely and can present unique challenges, a per-square-foot estimate is really a ballpark figure for you to get started. Here\u2019s an overview:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic costs for an NYC home renovation<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When estimating price per square foot, the scope of work usually includes the following:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Basic demolition <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Framing: the skeletal, load-bearing structure to which the interior walls and other systems are attached <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Insulation and drywall <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Wiring, including outlets and switches <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">Heating\/cooling systems <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">All visible materials and fixtures in kitchens and baths (described below) <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This doesn\u2019t include appliances. Also bear in mind that the choices you make for visible materials\u2014tile, flooring, millwork, paint, lighting fixtures, electronics, and more\u2014can significantly affect the price of your renovation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>At the $100 to $200 psf range:<\/h4>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Materials are generally prefabricated or stock items and in finishes that are available at common retail outlets. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Cabinets in this price range are typically MDF (medium-density fiberboard). <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Tiling will run under <b>$10<\/b> <b>psf<\/b>. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Lighting will be standard but solid basics. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">Solid wood floors may be shorter, narrower planks made of less expensive woods. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\">The work will be careful, clean, and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/home-remodel-bay-ridge-brooklyn-pre-war-appeal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">well-installed at this level<\/a> with higher quality labor and skillsets at the upper end of the range. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At <b>$200<\/b> to <b>$300<\/b> <b>psf <\/b>range:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some customization on details such as joints, millwork, and hardware<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cabinets are custom or semi-custom and can include built-ins.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countertops in natural stone or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high-quality manufactured materials.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Solid, wide-planked hardwood flooring<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Projects at this price point are not usually gut renovations, but rather remodels that focus on the space within the existing walls.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\">One thing to note<\/span><span class=\"s1\">: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote<\/span><span class=\"s5\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">What you\u2019ll get for <b>$300 per square foot<\/b> and higher:<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>$300<\/b> <b>psf<\/b> or above will usually pay for layout changes or structural work, such as <span class=\"s3\">combining apartments<\/span>. <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving walls, adding staircases, shifting gas and plumbing, and electrical rewiring all contribute to a higher per-square-foot cost, as well as add to the behind-the-scenes expenditures (more on that below). <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since pricing for kitchens and baths runs higher than other rooms, more of those equal a higher price per square foot. For example, renovating a 1,000-square-foot apartment that has three bathrooms will be more expensive than an apartment of the same size with just one bathroom.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At this level and beyond, you can expect to see more extensive customization, fine finishes, and luxurious materials. This includes handmade tile, exotic wood grains, natural stone, and custom millwork details that complement the home\u2019s architecture. You might also see custom door casements and extensive lighting details.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. Design<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on your general contractor and your level of involvement in the project, you may also want or need professional design services. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You may need an architect. Architect approvals are required any time you make changes to the structure or to plumbing or gas lines. Many Sweeten general <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/new-york-city-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractors in NYC<\/a> can refer architects for your project.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You may consider a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/truth-design-build-firms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">design\/build firm<\/span><\/a>, which combines design and construction services within one fee and contract.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. Building and city requirements<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you live in a co-op or condo building, you\u2019ll likely need to submit your plans drawn by an <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/when-do-you-need-an-architect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">architect<\/span><\/a> to your building\u2019s board. Co-ops are generally stricter about renovations than condo buildings, though many condos are now adopting more stringent rules as well. Buildings may also have minimum requirements for construction insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some alteration agreements require a security deposit to cover potential damage. They may also include the fees incurred by the condo or co-op board to review and approve your plan. You may find that contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive specifications have higher rates in order to meet higher insurance requirements.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The NYC Department of Buildings requires that you obtain permits and inspections for many types of construction work, including plumbing, electrical, and structural. Permits can add up. An electrical permit can run close to <b>$900<\/b>, plumbing permits can cost from under <b>$2,000<\/b>\u00a0to <b>$5,000<\/b>, and an asbestos inspection can be <b>$500<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. Demolition and site prep<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on the state of the original space, you may need to do extensive preparatory work after demolition and before installation. Older apartments will almost always require stripping, leveling, and plastering. Uneven floors and walls must be leveled before cabinets can be hung, doors framed, or tiling installed. These costs are determined by the general contractor once they have a chance to examine your space.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4. Behind-the-scenes costs<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p>Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as t<span class=\"s1\">he main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts, from what we have seen,&#8221; said an NYC Sweeten contractor. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Compared to costs for the &#8220;visible&#8221; parts of your renovation, pricing for the &#8220;unseen\u201d costs can be difficult to anticipate. While labor is a clear one, keep in mind that different forms of labor can be priced very differently. Wiring and plumbing work, for example, tend to be expensive. And over the past year, master plumbers and electricians have seen costs go up, \u201cprimarily due to the safety measures and certifications that have been imposed on these trades by the Department of Buildings,\u201d said <span class=\"s3\">Sweeten<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">NYC general contractor Aaron<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Plumbing generally runs between <b>$1,500<\/b> to <b>$2,000<\/b> per fixture in New York City. So, prepare for at least <b>$5,000<\/b> for a licensed plumber to run new lines for a sink, toilet, and bathtub. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Skim coating,<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s3\"> a technique<\/span> that smoothes a wall, hiding all imperfections, is the most expensive type of labor. In some cases, it can be more affordable to tear down old walls and put up new drywall.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Consider that from the contractor\u2019s perspective, \u201clabor\u201d on the budget proposal may include not only the hourly rate they pay their workers, but also insurance, license, and other overhead fees that keep their business running. (Contractors typically take home 10-15% profit. For example, if they do $2 million worth of business this year, they are netting about $200k.) Insurances and other costs of running a business increase year over year, and while the costs are not passed 1:1 to the client, contractors must raise prices to maintain operations. Some show a specific line on the budget for profit\/overhead, while others build it into other budget lines.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8MN5ps2Rvfg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Tips on how to budget your NYC home renovation<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you\u2019ve accounted for each line item in your budget, allocate an additional 10 to 15 percent as a cushion. Projects can run over budget as a result of unforeseen circumstances, so it\u2019s good to err on the safe side.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many factors go into the per-square-foot estimates. Trying to come up with a plan to match your budget? Here are some tips from contractors and renovating homeowners:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Mix high and low.<\/b>\u00a0This refers to materials, which should be selected for maximum impact. You may choose a handmade tile for the kitchen backsplash while sticking to an off-the-shelf option for the second bath. Make a custom statement where it will really get noticed, and use standard materials where it won\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Don\u2019t skimp on plumbing and electrical infrastructure.<\/b> Although these aspects probably won\u2019t get you many compliments at a dinner party, you still need licensed and qualified experts for these jobs. If you don\u2019t, there may be expensive problems to deal with in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Focus on kitchens and baths.<\/b> Spend your money here! A <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen upgrade<\/a> and a refreshed bathroom have the most resale value impact.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Consult experts upfront.<\/b> If you are inclined to hire an architect or designer for a major transformation, get them on board early. This can save money by mapping out a clear plan, helping you avoid costly changes mid-stream. Set aside 15 to 20 percent of your budget for this professional. In general, hiring licensed professionals early is a cost-effective way to prevent insurance headaches later on by using their expertise to avoid mistakes that can lead to delays.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\"><\/span><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors in NYC<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Not sure how to start your renovation?<span class=\"s3\"> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Click here for Sweeten\u2019s six steps<\/span><\/a> on planning your remodel and how to find a vetted general contractor.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Updated March 21, 2023<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1 mb-0\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
