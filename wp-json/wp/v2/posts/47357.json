When it was built in 1926, it boasted the highest elevation in Brooklyn. I purchased my apartment a few years after graduating law school\u2014a two-bedroom, one-bathroom, 1,000-square-foot unit with six windows facing Underhill Avenue. In the more than 26 years since I moved in, I\u2019ve maintained the apartment in its mostly original state due to the fear the daunting task of renovating sparked in me.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year when, looking to the future and my retirement, I decided it was time for the redo. I live by myself and my vision had evolved for a long time. I wanted a contemporary but classical look for the kitchen and bathroom, sleek, bright, and cohesive. In the galley kitchen, I wanted to increase cupboard and counter space, and install a washer\/dryer and dishwasher. In the small bathroom, I wanted to remove the large bathtub and install a walk-in shower.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Comparing multiple bids for the remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ready to roll on the job, I <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/36698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted my project<\/a>. This was a massive undertaking and I had concerns about reconfiguring my bathroom plumbing and adding infrastructure to support a washer, dryer, and dishwasher to the kitchen. Sweeten patiently listened to my fears and concerns, sent multiple contractors, and offered to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help me with bid leveling<\/a>. I finally made my choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In our first meeting, my Sweeten contractor and I discussed my vision. We then met at the tile store, where he helped me select floor and wall coverings, and different grout. When I asked for space and time to seek out materials and fixtures on my own, the contractor was patient and kind. I found the kitchen sink and the lighting fixtures online, and my toilet while attending a Sweeten event at Manhattan\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/stores.kohler.com\/en\/locations\/new-york\/new-york-city\/kohler-experience-center-by-best-plumbing-supply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kohler Experience Center<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This year when, looking to the future and my retirement, I decided it was time for the redo.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Bathroom remodel for accessibility<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The walk-in shower was the basis for the entire renovation. I focused on it and its functionality, first. I had back surgery in 2005, followed by hip replacements in 2011 and 2013. A doctor friend recommended replacing the high-walled bathtub with a step-in shower as I look towards <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement and future possible physical limitations<\/a>. The co-op required board approval and I consulted with master plumbers, but my Sweeten contractor took care of the paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Washer and dryer in the kitchen<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My kitchen priorities were not typical. Having a washer and dryer in my apartment had been my dream for years. I wanted apartment-size units on pedestals, so I wouldn\u2019t have to bend too far down when loading and unloading, and a counter above for a folding area. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I desperately wanted working counterspace, since the only existing work surface <\/span><span class=\"s9\">was a 12\u201dx10\u201d pull-out shelf. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">My research revealed quartz countertops to be a durable, low-maintenance choice\u2014spills do not soak into the non-porous material. White subway tile with a dark grout brightened the narrow room and made the walls stand out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most kitchen base cabinets come 24\u201d deep, but I found a 15\u201d option that worked for the slim kitchen\u2019s non-appliance side. I was going to do all white fronts, but decided on dark gray for the bottoms and white for the uppers, keeping it light, yet providing contrast. The upper cabinets go up to the 10\u2019 ceiling so that dust doesn\u2019t get trapped\u2014serving platters are stored in the extra space. The under-cabinet dimmable lights I found were a wonderful surprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/div>\n<h3>Staying home during the renovation<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The construction crew couldn\u2019t finish fast enough. Renting another space had felt like an excessive expense, so I\u2019d decided to stay in the apartment. I spent the time, against my contractor\u2019s advice, living in the apartment\u2019s second bedroom with no kitchen or bathroom for nine weeks. I purchased a $100 mini-fridge, used the staff bathroom in the building\u2019s basement, and showered at my sister\u2019s Brooklyn home, since Covid-19 shut down my gym. After that experience, the new shower became my escape, my solitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Over budget, but increasing home value<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As renovators go, I was a fearful first-timer. I am an HGTV addict, but this is New York City\u2014rooms are smaller and costs are higher. Originally, I budgeted $85,000 for the two rooms, not including appliances. After hearing bids, I upped it to $100,000, but permit costs and other extras brought me to $107,000, and when I added high-end appliances, I was up to $120,000. I traded in American Express and Citibank points for a total of almost $5,000! Was I upset? No, I deserve this renovation, and I have increased my home\u2019s value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Every time I walk into either room, I\u2019m filled with joy. The laundry space, and not having to lug my clothes to the basement, makes me smile. My bathroom appreciation grows one step (into the shower ) at a time! For years, when I went to other people\u2019s homes, I wished I could have spaces like these. Now I do. I am so very grateful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>We&#8217;re glad to see this accessible kitchen and bath remodel come to life.
