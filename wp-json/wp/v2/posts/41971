That\u2019s just one reason why it was a match for John, a minimalist seeking to upsize in the city. The finance exec closed on the two-bedroom abode in the Murray Hill neighborhood and was committed to an expansive renovation before moving in. Aspiring to a modern, clean aesthetic, he hired\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aurorafarewell.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">architect and designer Aurora Farewell<\/a>, who works in New York and Connecticut, to oversee the project and to take the space to spare and spectacular. Aurora posted the project on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, and together with John chose their Sweeten contractor.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41911 size-full\" title=\"portrait\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg\" alt=\"portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">For John, the decision to finally purchase an apartment of his own in Manhattan was two-fold.

His biggest gripe was an awkward partition wall that closed off the kitchen from the living and dining rooms. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">According to his architect, they worked to create an open floor plan unifying the kitchen, dining, and living spaces, \u201cas well as to allow for a more gracious master bath and master bedroom.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Next, they moved on to a long list of features and finishes, all of which, John said, was \u201cin working condition, but dated.\u201d A simple design was needed based on clean lines and spare decor. He favored neutral \u201cbackground\u201d colors on walls, floors and cabinets, and furnishings that were practical and useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41908 size-full\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-16.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-16.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-16-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41910 size-full\" title=\"kitchen island\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Practical goals<\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Aurora agreed with John\u2019s ideas and thought they meshed perfectly with her own vision, focused largely on the apartment\u2019s bank of east-facing windows. \u201cThe <\/span><span class=\"s2\">tall panes of glass overlook the stately building fa\u00e7ades that line Park Avenue, and up to the sky,\u201d she said. \u201cThe morning light in the apartment was beautiful, and I wanted to fix the layout so that John could appreciate it in full.\u201d As it was, she said, the window wall\u2019s impressive span was broken by the kitchen partition, plopped right in the middle of\u2014and from either side blocking\u2014the breathtaking view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">After reviewing the multiple Sweeten bids, Aurora and John decided on their contractor, who coordinated with them and advised on a number of aspects of the project. In addition to the literal big picture, Aurora and John had practical goals. \u201cI was hoping to not have to use my oven for file storage anymore,\u201d he said, stressing that this was not an exaggeration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s3\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41907 size-full\" title=\"dining space\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg\" alt=\"dining space\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41894 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg\" alt=\"bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Adding hidden storage<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Seeking to maximize the amount of storage space in the apartment without compromising on design, they decided to rip out the wall between the kitchen and dining area, which came at the expense of the pre-existing utility closets that had been built into it. To compensate, the contractor built two closets on opposite walls of the dining area, one to accommodate coats and luggage, and the other to store sporting goods and other sundry stuff. With that wall out of the way, the contractor\u2019s team installed the new kitchen comprising slate-gray designer cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops, and high-end stainless-steel appliances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Storage was a priority for other rooms as well. In the master bedroom, the plan dictated bumping into the current clothes closet, which would then be expanded on the opposite side, in addition to building a new shoe closet. The guest bedroom, which would also function as John\u2019s home office, would be kitted out with enclosed cabinets and shelving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41895 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"bathroom cabinet\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom cabinet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Gutted bathrooms with complete upgrades<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The bathrooms, both of which were gut-renovated, received complete upgrades with porcelain tile, patterns, and custom millwork. In the master bathroom, Aurora increased the functionality with a new linen closet, which the contractor bumped into a wall in order to build.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The<span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u00a0six-<\/span>month renovation went smoothly, John said, with \u201cno major hiccups along the way,\u201d save the necessary pulling of an unanticipated permit from the New York City Department of Buildings before the removal of the kitchen partition. The wall, the architect explained, was non-load-bearing but still tricky to take down, since it was part of the building\u2019s original construction plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41896 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41899 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-07.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-07-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Crediting the contractors<\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">John credited his Sweeten contractor as a key player in the project, noting that the building team was among the critical reasons why the project was a success. He suggested taking all you can from the experts you\u2019ve assembled to help you through the project, while at the same time tuning in to your own intuition. \u201cOnce you make a decision,\u201d he said, \u201cstick with it. Otherwise, you run the risk of not only second-guessing yourself, but of delaying delivery of materials and installation. If one step in the process is delayed, it can have a domino effect on subsequent tasks.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">John said that those steps, at least when they proceeded smoothly, were some of the most satisfying components of the job, day-by-day, and week-by-week, as he watched his new space change. What came slowly at the beginning then accelerated, transforming to progress and carrying through to a pleasing conclusion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI feel,\u201d John said, \u201clike I\u2019ve found not just a place to live and sleep, but a permanent home in the city.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, John, for sharing your new home with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">DESIGN NOTES FROM ARCHITECT AURORA FAREWELL AS TOLD TO SWEETEN:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">We wanted to appreciate the natural light in full. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by the dividing wall, home to closets and a massive fridge. We agreed a continuous row of windows would be better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">We relied on light fixtures to act as focal points in the space and to illuminate the client\u2019s artwork without needing to use additional art lights. Two brass wall sconces are placed strategically in the living room to provide ambient light, and a statement fixture anchors the kitchen area,\u00a0 illuminating across the entire length of the island. Both this and the oversized dining room pendant act as sculptural elements. Carefully placed 3-inch ceiling soffits facilitated critical adjustments in architectural lighting, including the addition of the beautiful kitchen island pendant, without sacrificing overall ceiling height. The fireplace surround and hearth were redone in slate with a minimal, painted mantel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-41912 size-full\" title=\"entryway\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg\" alt=\"entryway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">In the dining area, symmetric closets flanking the dining table replace the storage lost in the removal of the functional wall and closet bank separating the kitchen and living room.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The kitchen island is Calacatta marble with waterfall sides that give it weight despite its smallish scale; it stands as an object in the kitchen and speaks to the elliptical dining table, which has similar marble veining. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">By downsizing the dishwasher, we created space for the refrigerator to move, while maintaining critical site lines throughout the apartment. The architectural moves are simple, but bring coherence to the overall plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The master bathroom is clad in large-format porcelain tile in light-gray veining chosen for durability and aesthetic appeal, with just enough pattern to not overwhelm the space. The bathroom is timeless and the combination with porcelain tile and minimal grout mean that it will remain pristine for years to come.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The interior finishes and furnishings internalize the terra cottas and wrought-iron tones from the streetscape, placing the emphasis on the view beyond the windows. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">The flooring throughout the apartment a light-toned wood-topped engineered floor from PID that the client chose himself.
