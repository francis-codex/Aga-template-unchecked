Interested? We hope you\u2019ll find Sweeten&#8217;s following guide helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What is a general contractor?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">A general contractor is a person (and company) that coordinates and supervises construction projects, including renovations. This includes securing required permits, and hiring, scheduling, and overseeing all the subcontractors (masons, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, etc.).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">In most areas, general contractors are required to be licensed, and to carry worker\u2019s compensation insurance, as well as specialized liability for construction. The general contractor is financially responsible for any injuries or property damage at the job site.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Are there different kinds of general contractors?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes. Contracting companies can offer a range of services. Some are \u201cbuild-only\u201d firms, which only work from drawings provided by the client. Others are full-service \u201cdesign-build\u201d firms, which will have designers and possibly even architects on staff. And there\u2019s a spectrum between these extremes, including firms that can offer advice on materials and finishes, and firms that make architect referrals.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s also a range of firm sizes. Some are sole-proprietorships or 2-person partnerships. Others have many employees, including front office staff. As you\u2019d expect, most general contracting firms start small and grow over time.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What does Sweeten look for in general contractors?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten expects professionalism, great communication skills, an outstanding portfolio, and the following objective qualifications:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">All required general contractor licensing for your service area<\/span><\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A certificate of insurance for General Liability coverage<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">A business registered under the same name for at least 6 months&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Who can become a general contractor?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The field is open to anyone; there are no specific physical or educational requirements. However, your chances of success will be greatest if you have experience in the construction industry. This can include a construction trade, design, project management, estimating, or property management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Be aware that the job is mostly about management and running a business. Your knowledge, administrative skills, and people skills will be more important than your ability to swing a hammer.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">How to become a general contractor<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two common paths to take. Each can prepare you to get licensed and registered, so you to can take on jobs that require hiring subcontractors:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Work for yourself in your trade (as a carpenter, plumber etc.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Work for another company, and work up to a supervisory role&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s the worst way to become a general contractor?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Start out as a designer, and hire subcontractors to complete projects\u2014even though you don\u2019t have a general contracting license or construction insurance. Unfortunately, this is common, and is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">How do I become licensed?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">See the
