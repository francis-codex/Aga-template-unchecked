Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale. Whether you\u2019re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it\u2019s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale, especially if you know you&#8217;ll outgrow your current home. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home\u2019s attractiveness to potential buyers. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers an overview of the best home upgrades for resale value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png\" alt=\"Get Matched With Contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!<\/p>\n<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments<\/h3>\n<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity\u2014a co-op or condo board\u2014in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you\u2019re on the board, but that\u2019s a whole different story.) As an owner, you\u2019re responsible for \u201cwalls-in,\u201d so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.<\/p>\n<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses<\/h3>\n<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn\u2019t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it\u2019s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don\u2019t address them. If you don\u2019t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">The best interior <\/span><span class=\"s1\">home upgrades for <\/span><span class=\"s1\">resale value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we\u2019ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling\u2019<\/i>s 2020 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Cost vs. Value Report<\/span><\/a>:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452\u00a0has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">A mid-range bathroom addition that costs $49,598 has a resale value of $26,807 and recoups<b> 54%<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Small <\/span><span class=\"s1\">home resale upgrades<\/span><\/h4>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. <\/b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it\u2019s safe to say that many buyers won\u2019t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it\u2019s worth calling in the pros.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.<\/b> You can do this in a few different ways\u2014simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Swap out your fixtures.<\/b> \u00a0If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the \u201980s\u2014and not in a good way\u2014consider switching them out. You don\u2019t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Refinish your floors.<\/b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets\u2026this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function<\/b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and \u201cdecorative\u201d room dividers that are now just eyesores.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Single-space <\/span><span class=\"s1\">home upgrades<\/span><\/h4>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Kitchen updates.<\/b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you\u2019ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Bathroom updates. <\/b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one\u2014it\u2019s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>\u201cFlex space\u201d addition<\/b>. While it\u2019s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/combining-apartments-in-nyc\/\"><span class=\"s2\">combining apartments<\/span><\/a>), it\u2019s often helpful to add the idea of one.

Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you\u2019d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble.
