The whole apartment really needed a lot of updating; the appliances and fixtures were very old in the kitchen and bathroom, and there was so little storage space. I really like mid-century style and lots of color on a white background. The place had big, \u201cold\u201d character in its window and door moldings, fireplace, and wood floor.

Plus, the open shelves \u201csolved\u201d the corner issue and helped avoid weird, L-shaped upper cabinets. I love the contrast of the blue and white oak. I had the same colors in my bedroom in Rome when I was a kid and I think it just reminded me of home.

In the kitchen, I wanted a more neutral color given the strong character of the blue cabinets, so I went for a light gray.

So I designed a rectangular shower, which would be shorter than the tub\u2014leaving more space for the sink\u2014but still bigger than a traditional shower stall.<\/p>\n<p>A shower door would have eaten up space, so I opted for a rectangular opening and no door. To keep the water inside the glass walls, I chose a \u201crain-effect\u201d showerhead. (The rod next to the showerhead is a bracket that holds the glass wall in place.)<\/p>\n<p>My original idea for the floor was to have an \u201cinfinite shower\u201d with a sloped floor and no threshold. This wasn\u2019t going to work, so I had to include the white flexible rubber threshold glued to the floor tiles to keep the water in. (Not the best in terms of looks, but it works!) I attached a hand-held bidet to the toilet\u2014another \u201cEuropean\u201d detail of mine. I also repurposed a mini desk from West Elm as a sink vanity.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37969 size-full\" title=\"floor plan \" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg\" alt=\"floorplan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<em>(Above)<\/em> Floor plan of bedroom and closet<\/p>\n<p>Another storage puzzle was my <span style=\"color: #000000;\">bedroom<\/span> closet, the one and only closet in the apartment.\u00a0It was small and sat next to the bedroom door.

I had to learn how to make decisions very quickly every day. The six months of renovating were some of the most difficult months of my life; I\u2019m pretty happy it\u2019s over! My friends have been a huge help throughout the entire process; I\u2019m very lucky I have them. Sweeten, too, was helpful as I was wrapping everything up.<\/p>\n<p>I learned so much throughout the process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be prepared for much more time than is estimated<\/li>\n<li>When possible, choose simple design ideas<\/li>\n<li>Do the work all at once\u2014don\u2019t split the job into pieces<\/li>\n<li>Clarify details with the contractor prior to starting the job<\/li>\n<li>Understand what\u2019s included in your budget and what\u2019s a change order<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the end, I\u2019m so happy living in my newly renovated space, and my friends all like it, too.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Giulia.
