At this point, you have interviewed contractors and received their proposals. Estimates can vary drastically in terms of look and format. However, all estimates should include at least two things: a detailed scope of work and a price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you compare them when one is five pages long while the other is just one? Or when one is grouped by room, and the other is grouped by task? A note on terminology: \u201cbid,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d and \u201cproposal\u201d refer to the same thing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post your project and you\u2019ll have access to our bid leveling services to help make sense of the various construction estimates in front of you, including both <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> and non-Sweeten. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How many contractor estimates should I get?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/white-ikea-high-gloss-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">getting at least three contractor bids<\/a>. This allows you to understand the price of the work. You\u2019ll have a low, a medium, and a high bid and likely some differentiation in the services offered by the general contractors. Getting multiple estimates also gives you the chance to experience different personalities and communication styles. These are subjective factors important in your decision-making process. A <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great rapport with your general contractor<\/a> goes a long way in achieving a successful renovation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Breaking down how to compare contractor bids<\/h3>\n<h4>Similarities and differences in contractor estimates<\/h4>\n<p>Even though bids may come in a variety of formats, major work categories (like demolition, plumbing, electrical, etc.) are usually called out specifically. To begin, find the biggest categories of work in each bid and see how those costs compare. You&#8217;ll get a sense of how your candidates are thinking about the work and the time\/skill needed to complete it.<\/p>\n<p>There may be spots where bids diverge significantly. Some categories may be in some estimates but not others.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, the inclusion of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skim coating<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole apartment remodel<\/a> can increase the budget dramatically but not in all cases. One contractor may have included it, while another has not.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your site visits with individual contractors may include ideas or suggestions that didn\u2019t come up with other candidates, making a line-by-line comparison even more challenging.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each contractor may vary slightly in their approach to completing the work. Avoid major discrepancies in scope by confirming the work that you would like to bid out after the visit. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Including your HOA requirements<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check to confirm any requirements for renovating with your co-op\/condo board or HOA. Factors like site\/hallway protection, access to parking and service elevators, and work hours can impact the efficiency of labor and therefore the price of the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Post-site visit follow up<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should feel free to follow up with your candidates to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> clarify any particular costs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">give them an opportunity to provide a price for an idea that may not have come up during your site visit<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ask for their input on areas where taking another approach might help you achieve what you want at a lower cost<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How material choices factor into the bid<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assumptions are built into bids in different ways. Site visits give you a chance to meet with candidates and explain a broad overview of what you want to do. But if you don&#8217;t know the exact materials you plan to use, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/home-renovation-bids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">general contractors will provide \u201callowances\u201d<\/a> or educated guesses about what you will choose to spend on the materials based on the finish level you discussed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you might suggest you want very basic tiles, and out-of-the-box cabinets, nothing fancy. A general contractor might price with the assumption that you will buy budget-friendly materials. Or, you might suggest you want a luxurious countertop material and unique backsplash tiles to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recreate the kitchen<\/a>. The contractor might price assuming you\u2019ll purchase mid-grade, high-end, or luxury materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for you to understand the assumptions underlying the allowances. Anything in excess of the allowances in the bid, you\u2019ll have to pay for out of pocket. That said, some contractors leave allowances out altogether. It would be left to you to cost analyze within your <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/remodeling-cost-guides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole remodeling budget<\/a>, plan for, and purchase your finished materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for places where major material purchases (and permits, if applicable) are or are not itemized in the pricing. Does it vary across bids? The goal here is not to negotiate a particular price down but to clearly compare your options. Don\u2019t walk away from a great contractor because a price that looks high specifies materials that aren\u2019t included in another bid. Get clarity on assumptions about materials before you make your decision so you aren\u2019t surprised when it comes time to buy items that weren\u2019t in the bid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-34123\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/1000px-BidLeveling-v2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1154\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How Sweeten&#8217;s bid-leveling call helps you<\/h3>\n<h4>Sweeten walks you through how to compare contractor bids<\/h4>\n<p>At this point in the pre-renovation process, you\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted your project<\/a>\u00a0and met all of your contractors.
