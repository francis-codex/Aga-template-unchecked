Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we\u2019ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the most common renovation delays<\/a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Start Date Gamble<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">POSSIBLE ISSUE<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOLUTION<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you\u2019re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">POSSIBLE ISSUE<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Clients often ask, \u201cWhen will this project be done?\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><span class=\"s2\">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOLUTION<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Target start &#8211;<\/b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?<\/i><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Demolition &#8212; <\/b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?<\/i><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;<\/b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else\u2019s schedule and availability?<\/i><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Inspections &#8212;<\/b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?<\/i><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Finish work &#8212; <\/b><i>Will materials be available on time?<\/i><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">POSSIBLE ISSUE<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOLUTION<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">POSSIBLE ISSUE<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOLUTION<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make sure they aren\u2019t wondering where your crew is!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">POSSIBLE ISSUE<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn\u2019t moving fast enough.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOLUTION<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The logical sequence of work<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Availability of materials<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Commitments to other projects<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This doesn\u2019t mean the project isn\u2019t a priority, it\u2019s simply how you run a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>We hope this guide gave you some useful pointers on talking about client renovation timelines! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Check out the rest of Sweeten&#8217;s Contractor content series:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/how-to-include-profit-overhead-costs-in-renovation-project-estimates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Include Profit &amp; Overhead Costs in Renovation Project Estimates<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/the-virtual-site-visit-win-safely-with-sweeten\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Virtual Site Visit: Win (Safely) with Sweeten<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to set realistic expectations on your client\u00a0renovation timelines A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to the finish line.
