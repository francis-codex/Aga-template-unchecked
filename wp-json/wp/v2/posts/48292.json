They worked with a Sweeten contractor to add 400 square feet to their home. This allowed them to enlarge the family room, master bath, and master bedroom.<\/p>\n<p>The city of L.A. allowed residential construction to continue and precautions were followed while completing the renovation. Everyone on-site wore masks and the family moved out. The homeowner said on renovating during the shutdown, \u201cWe were limited by the pandemic on the things we could do as a family, so it made sense to turn our attention to something constructive.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Renovating to work-from-home<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a post-renovation galley kitchen remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47057 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a white bathroom renovation with blue pattern tile floor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Brooklyn homeowner <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michele contacted Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0before the pandemic hit to look for a contractor to overhaul her bathroom and kitchen.

She worked with her Sweeten contractor to make her \u201csmallish\u201d apartment accommodate her desired luxuries. Among them were a floor-to-ceiling pantry, a dishwasher, and plenty of storage space. Like many, customizing space to meet their daily schedules while at home is now more important than ever.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as require.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Planning for the future<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"laundry-area-subway-tiled-backsplash\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-48294 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Mickey-Apt-After-12.jpg\" alt=\"laundry area with washer dryer and white subway tiled backsplash and white kitchen cabinets after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Mickey-Apt-After-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Mickey-Apt-After-12-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Mickey-Apt-After-12-600x385.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47287 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mickey-Apt-After-02.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a white bathroom with walk-in shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mickey-Apt-After-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mickey-Apt-After-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Mickey-Apt-After-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Sweeten renovator <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mickey was looking ahead to retire<\/a> in the next couple of years and decided it was time to remodel his 1,000-square-foot apartment for his new lifestyle. With the help of his Sweeten contractor, he turned his kitchen into one l he&#8217;d admired in other people&#8217;s homes. He even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/options-for-apartment-washers-and-dryers-4153000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">included a washer and dryer<\/a>. A walk-in shower replaced a tub for easier access for limited mobility.<\/p>\n<p>He chose to stay in the apartment during the construction. This proved to be a challenge but one that outweighed the expense of renting a temporary space. Since COVID had shut down his gym, Mickey found alternatives for showering.

The first step was overhauling the dark atmosphere and removing the many built-ins. She posted her project to find a contractor who would turn the space into a \u201clight-filled, urban nest with an updated kitchen and bath.\u201d She chose timeless materials and kept permanent fixtures in the kitchen and bathroom neutral. Resale appeal was the goal.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of weeks into the process, New York City shut down. \u201cOur Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op\u2019s rules,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Taylor ended up leaving the apartment and quarantining outside of Manhattan. Luckily, she was able to manage the construction from a distance. She discussed design choices over text, email, and FaceTime. \u201cIt was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>A Chicago bathroom prepped for resale<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"double-vanity-sink-with-mirror\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-47486 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg\" alt=\"double vanity sink with marble countertop and large mirror and overhead wall mounted lights and towel bar above toilet after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten homeowner Krystin<\/a> was in the middle of updating her home in Chicago with the hopes of selling when the pandemic hit.
