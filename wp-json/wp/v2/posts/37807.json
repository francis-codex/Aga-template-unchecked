This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves. To take care of the wear and tear and to suit their needs and style, these homeowners turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. Here are four renovation projects aimed at renovating former rental properties into forever homes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-35590 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror, convert a rental into a primary residence\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment<\/h3>\n<p>Sherry\u2019s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east\/\">Sherry decided to move in<\/a> just ten years later. However, it hadn\u2019t been renovated since the \u201880s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-21360 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"convert a rental into primary residence, kitchen, black and white\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment<\/h3>\n<p>New York City\u2019s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a charming apartment with original details<\/a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.<\/p>\n<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property\u2014and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3.)

After the family hit their co-op\u2019s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"convert a rental into primary residence\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence<\/h3>\n<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">urban residence their permanent home<\/a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.<\/p>\n<p>_<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Renovating a rental property<\/a> isn&#8217;t so different from renovating your own home.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
