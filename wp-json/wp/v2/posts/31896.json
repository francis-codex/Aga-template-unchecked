It had everything they needed, including the extras\u2014central air, washer and dryer, dishwasher, ice maker, and garbage disposal. But, as it turned out, it also had a poorly laid-out bathroom that caused them nightmares. They had an\u00a0interior\u00a0architect friend who helped with the design, but <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/25722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">they posted their project on Sweeten<\/a> to find <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4073\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"gray-marble-bathroom-with-shower-head\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49106 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg\" alt=\"Gray marble bathroom with shower head and wall fixtures before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a decade, Jen, a senior managing director of a residential real estate firm in Manhattan, and Luke, who works in IT for a women\u2019s fashion and accessory house, had been subletting an apartment. When the owner decided to sell, they searched close to their neighborhood and found a 948-square-foot apartment in an 1892 factory building that had been converted to condos.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The master bathroom was the one dark spot on their otherwise sunny horizon. Apparently, there was a leak in the shower pan, which was causing the light gray marble floor to turn brown, yellow, and pink. \u201cWhen we purchased the apartment, we didn\u2019t realize that the shower was previously repaired for a leak,\u201d Luke said. \u201cBut the repair hadn\u2019t addressed the cause of the leak, which was the shower pan itself. We took this as a sign to renovate our bathroom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>After<\/strong><\/span>:\u00a0They contacted their friend and interior\u00a0architect Irene Kang. \u201cWe could not have done this without her help,\u201d Luke said. Kang suggested a minimalist design \u201cwith cool colors that maximized the space and had a lot of storage.\u201d As a real estate professional, Jen used her expertise as well. \u201cBathrooms are personal,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes apartments don\u2019t sell due to bathrooms since they are one of the most expensive rooms to renovate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They decided to go with neutral colors and plan to hang art to make the space personal. Aside from the shower pan issue, they needed more storage space. Irene suggested <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">large cabinets<\/a> inset into a wall shared with the master bedroom closet. \u201cI knew that there were approximately four to five inches of space on the interior of the drywall,\u201d Luke said. \u201cKnowing this and the depth of the cabinets, I was able to figure out that they would stick out only four to five inches into the bathroom itself, which would not get in the way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Luke-Miller-Bathroom05.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-bathroom-with-black-floor-tiles\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49107 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg\" alt=\"White bathroom with black floor tiles and floating vanity and vanity mirror and shower niche after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"large-storage-wall-insert-cabinet\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49108 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-05.gif\" alt=\"Large storage cabinets inserted into wall with white pocket door after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At first, they weren\u2019t sure where they could find something that would meet their needs. They found themselves at the Kohler Experience Center in Manhattan. \u201cWe described our idea, and Caroline [Hughes, their sales rep] suggested looking at the Robern line of cabinets,&#8221; Luke said. &#8220;We did, and that was it.\u201d\u00a0Now two cabinets measuring 70\u201d tall x 15\u201d wide and 8\u201d deep sit side by side. \u201cThey were expensive, but worth it,\u201d he said. In the end, their Sweeten contractor just had to frame it out and cut out a wall stud. \u201cIt was simple,\u201d Luke said.\u00a0To add to the storage,\u00a0the contractor\u00a0created a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/shower-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shower niche<\/a>, while the size of the vanity increased from 36\u201d to 60\u201d wide.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"glass-door-for-shower-niche\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49110 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg\" alt=\"Glass door for the shower niche with beige wall tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Between Irene,\u00a0the Sweeten contractor, and Caroline, \u201cwe had lots of help\u00a0with design decisions,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWe made all of our selections, including tiles and fixtures, in one afternoon.&#8221; Jen adds, &#8220;The\u00a0prices were reasonable and they can help you get non-Kohler items too. They made it super easy.\u201d Their favorite finds are the medicine cabinet above the sink and the LED mirrors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest challenge was living in their apartment <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">during the renovation<\/a>. \u201cWe have a one-bedroom, two-bath space and the master bath was undergoing the renovation,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWe were subject to mold, mildew, and construction dust, despite the best efforts of the contractor to keep everything clean. He did a superb job of keeping our space livable, but some things you cannot escape unless you have a ventilation system.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-bathroom-wall-tiles-white-grouting\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49111 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg\" alt=\"Beige bathroom wall tiles with white grouting and a recessed shower shelf after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their contractor focused on small details too, such as\u00a0selecting the threshold saddle for the shower and hiding the tile edges with aluminum molding. \u201cHe helped with the design and function every step of the way,\u201d said Luke. \u201cSweeten was in constant contact in case we needed help,&#8221; said Jen. &#8220;Since Luke has project management experience and has worked in furniture factories, we didn\u2019t require the attention that others might. But it was comforting to know they were there when needed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the support is what gave them the bathroom that they envisioned. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to listen to your designers, the store people, and your contractor,\u201d Jen said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell people what you want, but if they offer an opinion, listen. The client is always right and they will do what you want, but they know what will look good in years to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"happy-homeowners-sitting-on-the-couch\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-49112 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-12.jpg\" alt=\"Happy homeowners sitting on the couch with their dog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Luke-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Style finds<\/strong><\/span>: Floor and wall tile: Sourced by general contractor.
