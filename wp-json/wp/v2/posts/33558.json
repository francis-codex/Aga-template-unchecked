Some of their efforts went into looking ahead toward selling in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitoria, who is inspired by the simplicity of Japanese design, envisioned uncluttered white space with lots of natural wood color. \u201cSince we are growing a family in a small space, a place that looks tidy and serene was a priority. For us \u2018negative space\u2019 is actually positive,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33565 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33564 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors, natural wood\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood [so] the unevenness is barely noticeable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">Once the demo began, they were faced with a few surprises including rotten pipes in the kitchen sink and toilet and uneven floors.\u00a0<\/span>Changing the floor was imperative. Vitoria said she had some \u201ccrazy ideas\u201d to put in cork floors or use raw plywood cabinets in the kitchen, but then realized those materials would not increase the resale value and were too specific to her own personal taste. They opted instead for a pre-finished <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oak hardwood<\/a> which their contractor suggested. She admitted she was scared at first since the color of the boards varied quite a lot, but she soon fell in love. \u201cThe wood floor has so much personality!\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33754 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33567 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, white cabinets, quartz countertop\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33566 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While\u00a0redoing the subfloor in the bathroom, they decided not to renovate all the subflooring throughout the rest of the apartment to save time and money, &#8220;Since\u00a0we replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood,&#8221; Vitoria said. &#8220;the unevenness is barely noticeable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their Sweeten contractor helped with the layout of the kitchen, fitting in more storage with cabinets that were taller and deeper.\u00a0They kept the stove and washer-and-dryer in the kitchen and purchased a new refrigerator.

She also insisted on a Toto toilet and a slim Blomberg refrigerator. \u201cThese were non-negotiable. I had to have them!\u201d Since the remodel, Vitoria said, \u201cI actually have more space in the cabinets than I have things to put in them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also loved the idea of untreated pine for the open shelves above the sink to store what she called their \u201cshowpieces.&#8221; While visitors may think it\u2019s yet to be painted, she is happy with the result.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33571 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01-723x1084.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg\" width=\"723\" height=\"1084\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-33572 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"apartment renovation, Williamsburg, hexagon floor tile\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They had a good working relationship with their contractor, who not only had a great personality but\u00a0sourced materials that fit their taste and worked for resale\u00a0while being adept at managing their budget.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When their contractor took up the bathroom floor, he discovered the original 100-year-old tiles, which were cracked and loose. He had to remove two layers of tile and redo the subfloor, which delayed the project by a couple of days. &#8220;Throughout the whole process, he was very aware that we had no wiggle room in the budget and was super cost-conscious. We are extremely grateful for that,&#8221; said Vitoria.<\/p>\n<p>During the chaotic periods, they were glad to have Sweeten in their corner. Vitoria liked that Sweeten contacted her often during the renovation, commenting that it made her feel well taken care of and gave her peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p>Post-renovation, Vitoria knows that there will always be unexpected issues no matter how good your contractor is or how fat your budget. \u201cBut having a home that you love makes it worth every penny spent,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough my home is small, it feels spacious. I confess I only leave if I have to.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Vitoria and Jonathan, for sharing your new home with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>LIVING ROOM RESOURCES: Pendant lighting: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brostecopenhagen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Broste Copenhagen<\/a>.
