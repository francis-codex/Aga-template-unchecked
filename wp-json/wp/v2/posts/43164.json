In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River\u2019s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone\u2019s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor\u2019s residence.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg\" alt=\"family portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43298\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg\" alt=\"Duplex floor plan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. \u201cW<span class=\"s1\">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden<\/span>,\u201d said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was\u2014and every Manhattan miracle has one\u2014that the duplex needed renovation work.<\/p>\n<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s.

The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. \u201cThe ground floor has only two natural light sources\u2014the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back\u2014so this opening up was essential,\u201d Jenn said.<\/p>\n<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. \u201cHaving a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,\u201d Jenn said, \u201cand we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg\" alt=\"living room leading to outdoors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the kitchen and the apartment\u2019s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. \u201cWe said no to crown molding,\u201d Jenn said, \u201cand kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.\u201d As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect.
