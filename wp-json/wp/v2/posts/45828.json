But that wasn\u2019t the only <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/buying-renovating-timeline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aspect of the condo<\/a>, part of a historic 19th-century building conversion in South Williamsburg, that drew them to the remodel. The lofted duplex, with its 19-foot ceilings and armspan-width, was unique in its shipping-tube configuration. And then there was the owner. Jared had stayed all over and sought to bring an alluring boutique-hotel vibe to the place.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d been bouncing around between cities for a while\u2014Amsterdam, San Francisco, back to New York City,\u201d Jared said. \u201cI wanted a place to call home, that would really be a sanctuary. I spoke with the design team about the aesthetics of spaces I loved, like SoHo Farmhouse, the Bowery Hotel, the Maritime in Chelsea, Brooklyn\u2019s Wythe Hotel, the Freehold, the Clover Club, and the Walter.\u201d The White Arrow duo was reeled in.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe agreed we wanted to give the home the trappings of a sophisticated urban hotel,\u201d Keren said. \u201cIt needed to be great for entertaining, hosting guests, relaxing and working,\u201d which Jared, a digital agency founder, had been doing from home for years. The apartment, despite its high ceilings, was extremely narrow, with a ground-floor kitchen and living room that pushed the boundaries of its small footprint.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal was to make the home feel spacious and accentuate the positive,\u201d Keren said. The walls, she explained, were a \u201cdisjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles,\u201d including an inset stretch of exposed antique brick and a boxed-in, underutilized loft-bedroom platform. \u201cWe streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery square foot had to be well utilized,\u201d Jared said. He wanted to add nooks and niches to put his things, and make the place truly feel like his own.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The designers and their client also agreed that, instead of demolishing the place, they would elevate the existing finishes and fixtures. \u201cWe set out to minimize the rustic details the developer had selected during the conversion, and bring the home to a quiet level of cohesiveness with a new color palette,\u201d Keren said.<\/p>\n<p>Following White Arrow\u2019s plan, their Sweeten general contractor streamlined the place\u2019s odd juts and angles, and adding custom integrated display shelving in the kitchen as well as the home office-niche. Workers refinished the white-oak flooring with a more neutral, beige color tone and painted the dark exposed brick. \u201cI knew I wanted lighter floors for a more Scandinavian aesthetic, but was wary of bleaching them,\u201d Jared recalls. He trusted the team and has no regrets. Similarly, whitewashing the brick felt risky when the designers suggested it\u2014but it \u201ctotally opened the room,\u201d Jared said.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45654\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg\" alt=\"painted green cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur client took some creative leaps,\u201d Keren recalled. Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie. \u201cThe color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!\u201d Keren remarked. Their Sweeten contractor retiled the kitchen backsplash with marble penny tile and changed all door hardware and plumbing fittings in the kitchen, as well as the two bathrooms, which got new grout and caulk, toilets, vanities, medicine cabinets, and fixtures.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the place, the contractors added new lighting locations and dimmer switches and swapped in new fixtures. \u201cWe added dramatic chandeliers and sconces that draw the eye up to take in the dramatic, high ceilings,\u201d Keren said. \u201cLiving finishes\u201d such as an unlacquered brass kitchen faucet, bring warmth and texture. A home-media specialist integrated a sound system and a wall-mounted TV.<\/p>\n<p>It was with the furnishings that the designers really connected with the hotel aesthetic they strove for. \u201cWe chose distinctive, contemporary pieces in rich materials and jewel tones,\u201d Keren said. Both Keren and Thomas were excited to shop and showcase an unusual mix of international designers, including Muller Van Severin, Gio Ponti, Atelier Areti, Harto, Maison Sarah Lavoine, Slash Objects, and Trnk. \u201cWe sought out furnishings that would do \u2018double duty\u2019 to maximize small spaces,\u201d Keren said\u2014sophisticated sofa beds, the secretary desk that Jared describes as \u201can ingenious space-saver.\u201d<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>\u201cEvery piece,\u201d Keren said, \u201cis of the right proportion and scale,\u201d including the king-size bed that Jared considered a must-have in the loft bedroom. The designers searched endlessly to find the furniture pieces that would allow every room to feel both luxurious and functional. To mellow the mood of the bedroom, Keren said, they added \u201ca floor-to-ceiling, emerald-green velvet drapery to hide the formerly visible ensuite bath.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The project had a fast turnaround, thanks to Sweeten\u2019s vetting and follow-up during the project, Keren said. \u201cThe contractor was easy to work with and accommodating as the scope grew.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As for the owner\u2014Jared has been pleased to have his own digs to hunker down in during uncertain times. \u201cThe designs are super smart and well executed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe living-room nook is discrete and conducive to relaxation. I am really happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Keren and Thomas of White Arrow, and Jared, for sharing the results of an inspired collaboration!<\/em><\/p>\n<h5>SHOPPING GUIDE<\/h5>\n<p>KITCHEN: Wood flooring and matte white-washed finish stain from Bona Traffic: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bona.com\/en-US\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bona<\/a>.
