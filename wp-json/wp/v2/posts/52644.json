However, for a short time during the project, you might feel some&#8230;frustration, especially if you are accustomed to being at home most days.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s all manageable, however, and you\u2019ll do fine if you know what to expect. It\u2019s all about adaptability and making as many choices proactively as possible. Get things set up before it feels like an emergency. You\u2019ll be inconvenienced for several weeks or so, if the project goes as planned. Sweeten outlines how to live through a kitchen remodel below.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">Set up a temporary kitchen<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Naturally, you\u2019ll have to feed the family and clean up after meals and snacks, so you\u2019ll need some sort of temporary kitchen. If you have room for a temporary kitchen, old dismantled kitchen cabinets could create a makeshift mini-kitchen space. Even some of the old countertop could be used.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you don\u2019t have an extra room, where can you carve out some space for, say, 2\u20134 weeks? You might use the patio\/deck and grill for a lot of cooking and the default dining table, if the weather cooperates.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moving the refrigerator to a space where it\u2019s still usable is typically mandatory. Go over changes like these with the contractor so you don\u2019t block a space they\u2019ll need to access.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You might wonder if the fridge can move to the deck or patio, and it\u2019s possible, but it&#8217;ll depend on the weather. Refrigerators have an ambient operating temperature range, and if the outdoor temperature goes below ~40 degrees, the compressor won\u2019t run. If the compressor doesn\u2019t run, then the freezer won\u2019t work. Likewise, avoid setting a refrigerator in full sun. The heat will force the compressor to work much harder and more often, which will shorten its life.<\/p>\n<h4>Cooking without a normal kitchen<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cooking is really pretty easy. You can use a camp stove, toaster oven, microwave oven, instant pot, and\/or grill for numerous meals. You probably can\u2019t move and use your freestanding range, as they require a 240v outlet and dedicated circuit for power.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">Staying at home during a kitchen remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are accustomed to being at home quite a bit, the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">process of construction might unnerve you<\/a>. Naptime for the kids will be tough to keep going, as will any work duties you plan to accomplish. Going to the office a bit more may turn into an attractive option, along with coffee shops and shared office spaces.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Do the daily work hours work for you? Tradespeople often start early and their work is often noisy. If you like to sleep in, you will probably chafe at having workers at the house early in the morning, but that\u2019s what it takes\u2014temporarily.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Talk with your contractor about the daily schedule to set shared expectations. Surprises happen and everyone has to roll with them. An organized and professional contractor will set you up as well as possible.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">Living in a hotel during the remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another option that has unique benefits is staying at a hotel. You can choose a standard stay or an extended-stay suite, which may even have a mini-kitchen. These offer clear and compelling advantages: low commitment and high flexibility, as in booking and leaving with little notice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cost may seem high but it may be well worth it to avoid the chaos of living in a remodeling zone. You will have to live somewhere during the work, so a hotel could be just part of the project budget.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">Create a contingency plan to cover surprises<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, have a contingency budget plan of 10-15% if something goes awry. The worst-case scenario would be something like discovering asbestos or mold, which must be professionally remediated. Those professionals are specialty crews, not your contractor or subcontractors. That could stop other work until they are done. There\u2019s no good way to estimate how long that work could take, but your general contractor will know how to find the experts and rearrange the schedule and sequencing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other common scenarios are occasional shortages of materials or <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mistakes in ordering or fulfillment<\/a>. Special-order items, for example, can be subject to delays. Luckily, a good contractor can peruse your plan and spot potential bottlenecks quickly, but it\u2019s good to be prepared.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There\u2019s a lot to consider for a kitchen remodel, but the hassle is temporary and the benefit is long term. With preparation and a flexible mindset, you\u2019ll be on the way to your dream kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
