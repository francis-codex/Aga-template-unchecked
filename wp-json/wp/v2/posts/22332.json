They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light\u00a0in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired\u00a0larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you\u2019ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here\u2019s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a\u00a0new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.<\/em><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although Amanda\u2019s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/chc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clinton Hill Co-ops<\/a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for\u00a0out-of-town visitors. \u00a0At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been\u00a0in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there\u00a0were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for\u00a0a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it\u2014after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/16653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted their kitchen renovation<\/a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn\u2019t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten\u2019s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/338020 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amanda\u2019s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted\u00a0for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. \u201cWe both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,\u201d Amanda explained.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out\u00a0Laura and Matthew\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen<\/a>, as well as Mario and Joe\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project<\/a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring\u2014a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single\u00a0set of glass doors was\u00a0installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama\u2014they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style=\"color: #000000;\">the work surface\u00a0requires<\/span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she \u201cadores them!\u201d Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept\u00a0their fairly new appliances from the apartment\u2019s previous renovation, they added\u00a0a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we\u2019ve ever heard\u2014about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that they\u2019re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: \u201cDon\u2019t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn\u2019t cut corners and finished on schedule\u2014it took about a month in the end. Although this didn\u2019t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he\u2019s doing and how long it\u2019ll take to do it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22343 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22339 size-chrono\" title=\"Clinton Hill kitchen renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a book lover, Amanda\u2019s one regret is that they didn\u2019t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space.
