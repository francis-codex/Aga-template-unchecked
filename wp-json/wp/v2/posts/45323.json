Houston residents enjoy a relatively low cost of living. But if there is one aspect about Houston that most residents would like to change, it\u2019s the floods. In Houston and Harris County, floods affect huge sections of the city on a regular basis. <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> outlines ways to protect your home from flooding in Houston. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why Houston floods devastate homes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Houston\u2019s wet season, from May to October, brings a punishing round of tropical storms, hurricanes, or just old-fashioned heavy rain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Houston rests near Galveston Bay, four major bayous, and numerous creeks. Floods are a fact of life in a city surrounded by so much water. If you live west of the city center, your home will generally hold up better during flooding. Residents of EaDo (East Downtown), Garden Oaks, Highland Village, and Midtown tend to fare better than other areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">M<\/span><span class=\"s3\">oving eastward from the city center increases the likelihood of high water levels and floods. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Kingwood, Spring Branch, the Heights, and Sharpstown all flood regularly. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda turned these neighborhoods brown with floodwater<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. The storms hit Meyerland, located mostly within the 100-year floodplain, particularly hard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Houston and Harris County are so heavily paved-over that runoff water cannot keep pace with these huge increases of water. Short of <\/span><span class=\"s4\">moving to another city, you can take a number of steps to protect your home:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Tip 1: Grade soil away from your house<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Houston&#8217;s mostly flat topography only rises about 50 feet above sea level. You won&#8217;t find steep hills and high elevation in this city. But you can create a type of &#8220;micro-elevation&#8221; on your own property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When building or renovating your house, redesign your property\u2019s grading. Regrade with proper water, erosion, and storm runoff management in mind. You want to avoid your yard and home turning into a lake.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s1\">Tip 2: Install a sump pump and maintain it<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your Houston <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">house has a basement<\/a>, it undoubtedly already has a sump pump. If not, install one immediately. Sump pumps discharge interior water to the exterior. It is valuable for high waters or for minor interior flooding. However, it will not protect your home against catastrophic flooding. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Your sump pump should be ready to turn on at any time. If not, it may experience power loss, clogging, or switch issues. If the unit cannot keep up with the water, install a larger unit.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The average lifespan of a sump pump is about 10 years. If your sump pump is at the end of this lifespan, consider replacing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Tip 3: Raise your house<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">The best solution to protect your home from a Houston flood is to elevate it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">At a very minimum, the City of Houston requires homes to have a one-foot elevation above the 100-year floodplain. But that minimum nowhere nearly addresses catastrophic events, like the rapid 12-inch rainfall that fell during Hurricane Harvey. If you plan on elevating your house, experts recommend elevating your home over 18 inches. Six-foot elevations are not uncommon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">When building a new house, resist the urge to build slab-on-grade if living in a flood-prone section. Instead, explore elevated foundations of three feet or more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">If you already own a house, you can retroactively elevate your house. This retrofit begins much like a house move, with the house raised by jacks on piers. But the house isn\u2019t loaded onto trucks and moved. Instead, a new, higher foundation is placed under the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Elevating your home starts at about $75 per square foot. It&#8217;s a major project that can take up to three months to complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Tip 4: Dry floodproof your foundation<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Imagine the outer part of your home\u2019s foundation wall as the hull of a boat. Water constantly surround a boat&#8217;s lower half, so it must be watertight.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Dry floodproofing treats your foundation with sealants and membranes. If water surrounds the lower section for a limited period, there should be little or no leakage into the home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">With dry floodproofing, the emphasis is on positive-side (exterior) sealants and membranes. Workers also apply negative-side (interior) sealants and membranes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">FEMA recommends homeowners opt for a \u201csubstantially impermeable wall.\u201d The wall helps limit water accumulation. In 24 hours, water will accumulate to a 4-inch maximum with a sump pump. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Entrust this project to a qualified contractor who has experience in dry floodproofing. Contractors well-versed in this project can often exceed that FEMA minimum performance level.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Tip 5: Install flood vents<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">In lieu of dry floodproofing, consider installing flood vents. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Contractors can install FEMA-compliant flood vents in your foundation walls. In dry times, these vents prohibit vermin from entering underneath your house. During floods, these vents open freely to allow the passage of floodwaters. At the same time, these vents block debris that can damage the structure.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">Flood vents may also help you reduce your flood insurance premiums. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Houston homes receive so much structural damage because of the force of the water on the foundations. Flood vents reduce that pressure.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Only certain types of foundations require flood vents. Many older Houston homes have a crawlspace foundation that supports the house with piers or columns. This foundation often has a skirt or non-load-bearing wall around the house perimeter. Sometimes, brick or concrete comprises the skirt wall instead of wood. Because the wall cannot hold back floodwaters, dry floodproofing is not a viable option.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Many Houston contractors can advise you on how to protect your home from flooding in Houston. They can assess whether dry floodproofing or flood vent installation is your best option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Tip 6: Install and maintain a backflow valve<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">During floods, one unhappy byproduct is sewer or water drainage backflow. During this, backflow sends sewer water into the house. Floodwater itself is dirty enough. But when sewage pipes directly into your home, that only adds insult to injury.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Some backflow valves are automatic, such as ball float valves in floor drains. On the other hand, manually-operated gate-style valves open and close by turning a wheel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Note that backflow valves prevent your house\u2019s sewage from running into the sewer main. Standard backflow valves provide no way for you to <span class=\"s1\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flush a toilet<\/a><\/span>. Speak to your contractor about backflow valves with ejector pump attachments. These attachments can divert your sewage back into the sewer system, while still preventing backflow from coming into your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">More ways to prevent or ease flood damage in Houston<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Raise exterior outlets\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Electrical code typically requires only that exterior outlets be accessible from grade, or ground, level. For Houston with its floods, this usually translates to \u201ctoo low.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">An electrician can relocate your exterior GFCI outlets. The outlets should be at least one foot above the expected flood line.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Check your exterior drainage system<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Your house\u2019s gutters collect rainwater from the roof. Drainpipes move that water downward. Make sure that this interdependent system works properly which your contractor can assess. If your system needs repairs, they can recommend and install solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Install waterproof flooring at (or below) grade<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">If your home\u2019s lowest level is on-grade or is below-grade (like a basement), avoid installing carpet, solid hardwood, or engineered wood flooring. As long as that level remains dry, you are fine. But if that level overflows with water, the best response is to remove the flooring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Hard-surface, 100-percent waterproof flooring stands a good chance for successful cleanup. Consider installing ceramic or porcelain tile, resilient plank, sheet, or tile floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Using these ways to protect your home from flooding will provide peace-of-mind.
