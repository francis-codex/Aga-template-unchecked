At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve observed how these themes inform the most popular Miami home remodeling trends. It&#8217;s clear that h<\/span><span class=\"s1\">omeowners are rethinking both aesthetics and function, indoors and out.

It\u2019s more about reconfiguring\u2014taking away and adding walls, refreshing appliances, and fixtures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen trends for functional and style<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Consistently close to the top of the remodeling project list in Miami is the <\/span><span class=\"s2\">kitchen<\/span><span class=\"s1\">. \u201cIt\u2019s the heart of the home,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/samrobin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miami-based interior designer Sam Robin<\/a>. \u201cMy philosophy about it hasn\u2019t changed much. If I entertain 100 people in my home, they\u2019ll all end up in the kitchen.\u201d With the kitchen serving as both a functional <em>and<\/em> fashionable space, Miami homeowners are upgrading the room to work hard and look appealing. Below, Sweeten lists the go-to updates Miami homeowners are requesting for their kitchens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"gray-bathroom-with-gold-hardware\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52385\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/93911#after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #76808f;\">Sweeten kitchen remodel<\/a> in Miami. Photo by Real Estate Captured.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Upgrading kitchen appliances<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So many renovation plans include updating and re-prioritizing the styles and functions of appliances. The nationwide trend is toward cooking with wellness in mind, so steam ovens are becoming more prevalent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Induction cooktops are catching on (\u201cabsolutely, very trendy,\u201d said Adrian. Sam said she still prefers gas ranges.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Flexible room design<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchens opening to a great room are still popular, with cabinets that look more furniture-like. But there\u2019s definitely a move to closing off larger spaces when desired. Sliding, French, and barn-style doors do the trick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen islands are being more defined by function, so Sam has specified double islands for some clients. Multi-level counters also are trending. The varying heights allow for different functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">An organic look: Natural materials\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">For the overall look in the kitchen, designer Sam said there\u2019s a trend to more organic, more natural materials. It\u2019s all about changes in textures. Graphic backsplashes include porcelain, terra cotta, or concrete tiles. These can be earthy or bold color combinations or monochromatic tone-on-tone patterns like herringbone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s a big trend toward more rustic simplicity, like <i>wabi sabi<\/i>,\u201d she said, such as cement walls or concrete flooring and countertops. It\u2019s a real organic living space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are some other top Miami home remodeling trends in the kitchen:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Simple, flat-panel cabinetry. Lacquer finishes mostly have given way to matte.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Farm-style and trough sinks are on the rise.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Wide-planked floors (seven inches wide is average), such as light rift-cut oak or dark wenge.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Statement lighting. Shapes include large scale globes, square-shaped, or linear fixtures, especially over countertops<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Metal hardware. Burnished brass still is trending as well as black matte. Sometimes they\u2019re seen in the same room.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg\" alt=\"Marble bathroom with white double floating vanity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Miami bathroom by designer Sam Robin with Carrara marble and wide-planked cerused oak.

However, many homeowners are preferring freestanding showers. Features like aromatherapy and steam showers are gaining traction. That\u2019s especially true in luxury condos. <em>(For more info, see <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-south\/miami-condo-renovations-what-you-need-to-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten&#8217;s Guide to Remodeling a condo in Miami.<\/a>)<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In larger homes in Miami Beach, bigger master baths are open to the master bedrooms. Adrian has installed barnyard-style doors, 6-feet wide (and wider, when more privacy is preferred.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The top Miami home remodeling trends in the bathroom:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Floating vanities with integrated stone tops and storage drawers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Stone and porcelain featuring dramatic veining that can be book-matched on statement walls.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Touchless toilets and motion-activated faucets are desirable wellness\/hygiene features.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Multiple sources of lighting &#8211; Sam said while it\u2019s important to include downlights, lighting around vanities (usually sconces) is important so that shadows aren\u2019t created.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Wallpaper, especially with tropical themes, palm trees, or foliage, is very popular in powder rooms.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Outdoor space as an extension of the home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bringing indoor style and all of their comforts outdoors is a goal. No matter what the style, the connection from indoors to out cannot be denied. \u201cWe have such an inside-outside vernacular,\u201d said interior designer Sam. \u201cWe want to merge it because of a gorgeous landscape. It\u2019s like having a painting in every room.\u201d<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> Outdoor kitchens feature commercial-style grills, refrigerators, and wine coolers. Fireplaces or fire pits and water features add to the ambiance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"A stone walkway with palm trees in Miami\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1363\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-220x300.jpg 220w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-600x818.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Coral was repurposed for a walkway and retaining wall by designer Sam Robin.

There\u2019s a lot of wood, like ipe, a tropical hardwood that withstands the elements. Other materials for the outdoor space include travertine with grass in between, microcement, Keystone coral, and big boulders to create ponds. We\u2019re creating spectacular views, framed by foliage.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Indoor rooms opening up to terraces with a series of French doors or doors that fold back is another way to connect with the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Home offices get a makeover<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Sam also has gotten a lot of requests for home offices\u2014homeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cClients want a good back wall, appropriate for video meetings,\u201d said Sam. \u201cSomething more professional looking, with style. They also want space for the kids to focus with computers and homework. Not just a playroom for a bunch of Legos.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Sam said that allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of function. For example, sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty, with sleepers and desks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd there\u2019s creative storage,\u201d said Sam. \u201cClosets can be transformed into storage file systems with nice millwork, which can be opened up (when needed) instead of having a separate room. It depends on personal preference.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Some even opt for more than one home office; the addition appears to be boosting resale value, even with a modest investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Miami home remodeling trends: Design details in the home<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Impressing guests <em>and<\/em> personally savoring spaces<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners are investing money in renovation details that are big and small\u2014all of which make an impact on daily living.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Rolling bar carts make way for built-in cabinetry which holds wet bars, undercounter refrigeration, freezer, and wine coolers. \u201cMy clients all want wine rooms,\u201d said Sam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg\" alt=\"Home office with white and beige striped wallpaper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Sam Robin designed a home office in a bedroom for a pair of teens; painted stripes on the wall.

There\u2019s more accent lighting, like under-cabinet and lighting coves.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Graphic tiles (including for the floor), as well as concrete patterned tiles, are quite popular. Black and white geometrics and heritage Cuban designs are inspirations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Color palettes include earthy tones (creams and tans), blue and white (cobalt to watery blue-green), and vivid bold colors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Important structural elements for Miami homes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Another important consideration when remodeling in Miami is the threat of hurricanes. <\/span><span class=\"s2\">Building codes<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> are strict because of that.
