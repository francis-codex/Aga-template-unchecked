We now currently live in Staten Island. I started building homes in 1999 at the age of 23. I&#8217;ve been in residential construction for 20 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?<br \/>\n<\/strong>I was drawn into the construction industry at an early age. Both my grandfather and father were master tradesmen and a great inspiration, as a plumber and electrician, respectively. As a youngster, I always tagged along with tools in hand. I quickly gained a desire for design and building. What made it a reality for me was when my father built his first house in the &#8217;90s. I was on the job site every day, observing and participating in every aspect of construction. My first opportunity to branch out on my own was in 1999. My brother and I purchased an empty lot and built our first home from the ground up. It was an extraordinary experience. At the time, I was so young on the job site I was often asked &#8216;Where&#8217;s your father?&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transforming a client\u2019s home is an art form. I love the challenge of bringing a client\u2019s home back to a blank canvas then creating the environment they would never imagine. From the smallest details come the greatest rewards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the biggest challenges in New York are the building\u2019s board approval and the Department of Buildings. With over seven million residences and a limited staff at the Department of Building, permits often take an unexpected amount of time. Also, approval from the building\u2019s board is always different for each building. If you&#8217;re not experienced in this process it can take a lot longer than usual, that&#8217;s why our team has a process in place from start to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and budget are always the client\u2019s biggest misconceptions. Every project has an equilibrium of time versus money. You have to find the balance for both, how much time and budget each client has.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our team is highly skilled in designing in Autocad and Sketchup on the most complex renovations.\u00a0 We have a 3,000 square foot showroom where we assist designers, architects, and homeowners with their finish selections including kitchen cabinetry, countertops, flooring, and tile.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are authorized dealers for the finest finishes, both domestic and imported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparing apples and oranges, it&#8217;s important to look at what you are getting when working with a contractor. Design or craftsmanship can be way more expensive than you think. Our team bridges the gap between design and build.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We address all concerns promptly and in a timely manner. With our client portal,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we streamline the design and construction process by eliminating the unknown\u2014from scheduling, finish selections, approvals, communication, and change orders.\u00a0 Our clients can be at work or on vacation and still be able to track the progress of their project at their fingertips. With updated photos and viewing their entire schedule weeks or months in advance. They will have the ability to make changes and approvals on the fly and keep their project running on time and on budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite project that you\u2019ve done and why?<br \/>\n<\/strong>My most recent project was taking a 100-year-old Brooklyn brownstone from its current condition, which over the years seem to have been extensively altered from its original design. We modernized the space without jeopardizing the architecture and authentic style of the brownstone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City\/New Jersey building?<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Empire State Building. The Art Deco style building is what symbolizes NYC and gave New York its nickname: \u201cThe Empire State.&#8221; Gotta love it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City\/New Jersey neighborhood?<br \/>\n<\/strong>The Meatpacking District\u2014the cobblestone streets, the largest collection of Neo-Grec designs and wrought-iron facades, and great restaurants offer a great atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City\/New Jersey restaurant?<br \/>\n<\/strong>My favorite NYC restaurant&#8230; wow that\u2019s hard. I&#8217;m gonna have to say Cecconi&#8217;s Dumbo with skyline views of Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridge. The great food and architecture captivate my eye and excites my senses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you weren\u2019t a general contractor, what would you be doing?<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An artist or an architect\u2014I love both.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
