After a search that saw us move too slowly on a modest but well-located unit, and then get completely outbid on a dream apartment, we stumbled upon a two-bed, two-bath condo in Williamsburg. Not wanting to miss out again, we put in a bid and were surprised to get the place. That could very well have been the end of the story, but what fun would that be?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We\u2019d be the first to admit that the unit we purchased was totally serviceable. Only a few years old, it was a corner apartment with decent square footage and great city\/bridge views in an increasingly popular zip code. The unit had been rented to a prolific painter who\u2019d kept the walls white and the creativity high. It was a serviceable blank canvas; what it wasn\u2019t was the dream apartment we\u2019d lost out on months earlier. Regardless of how excited we were to be new owners, we just couldn\u2019t shake the \u201cif only&#8230;\u201d feeling for that spot and started thinking about ways to incorporate elements from the coveted (but now somebody else\u2019s) space into our new home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had no idea where to start, but after a search on New York renovations, I stumbled upon\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and spent a few days ghost-stalking various featured projects on the site. This gave me many ideas and the more we explored changes for our space, the bigger the scope of this potential project became, so we decided to focus on the area that could make the biggest impact: the kitchen. As it was, the apartment opened into a cramped one with little countertop space, limited storage, basic appliances, and no defined dining area. There was unused space above the cabinets and an odd mixture of lighting fixtures. In a nutshell, it was a cookie cutter kitchen in a cookie cutter condo and we really wanted something with more character.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13107\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE\" width=\"600\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE-300x113.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I put together a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/2075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project post on Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0with\u00a0a fairly clear idea of the feeling we wanted the place to evoke, even if the specifics weren\u2019t totally defined. Sweeten introduced us to a few design teams and we decided to work with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten Expert Thomas<\/a>\u00a0and his design\/build team\u00a0based on images of some of the spaces they had designed in Little Italy. We had them come out to the apartment to see what we had and right away, the team showed enthusiasm for the project and the type of aesthetic we were hoping to achieve. In hindsight, that was probably the most important decision we made &#8211; identifying the team that seemed to best understand the vision we had and showed a willingness to get us there (and stay within our budget) was key.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thomas&#8217;s team introduced us to their design\/build approach and though I had no experience with the model, it became clear we would be working very closely to get the space just the way we wanted it. But what was that, exactly? Aside from being slight on storage and functionality, our complaint was that the kitchen was generic, so looking to the neighborhood for inspiration, we envisioned a design that embraced the industrial history of the area without being too rustic. We also wanted to maximize the space by creating a more open floor plan. Through conversations with the design team, we zeroed in on a classic palette incorporating white, gray, brown, charcoal, black, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Palette aside,\u00a0there was little hope of gaining storage or making the space feel more open without a pretty drastic change to the layout. Thomas and his team\u00a0walked us through possible reconfigurations; we entertained the idea of installing an island or lengthening the counter, but because of the central placement of the sink and dishwasher, the only way to address the problem was to relocate both. Cue the plumber. The upside? We were able to position the sink in front of the window (where it\u00a0probably\u00a0should have been in the first place?) and\u00a0create a longer countertop surface as well as additional storage both above and below.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They say the devil is in the details and we learned this firsthand once the floor plan had been chosen and the time came to fill it. We have an admittedly eclectic style so the conversations about materials were lengthy and the direction of the design changed a few times. We went in knowing we liked metal, glass, tile and wood because they suggested the \u201cindustrial\u201d feel we liked, but it was most important that we assembled comfortable and clean materials. We knew we wanted appliances that would allow for entertaining and easy food prep and a look that would match, so a lot of time was spent narrowing down the colors of the tile and millwork and countertop and shopping for new appliances.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13110\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13109\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13108\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As part of the design\/build process, we were able to combine\u00a0an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IKEA<\/a>\u00a0pre-built cabinet base system with custom doors,\u00a0buffed and polished to create a bespoke look &#8211; a color that did not exist before we requested it! We finished the cabinetry with\u00a0hardware from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropologie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropologie<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0found the backsplash tile at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nemotile.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nemo Tile<\/a>. Thomas added open shelving\u00a0repurposed from wood that his team sourced, and complemented the look with a decorative but spare hanging pendant from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.abchome.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ABC Carpet and\u00a0Home<\/a>. The dishwasher, range, and fridge are all\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.vikingrange.com\/consumer\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Viking<\/a>. We found the table and benches at ABC\u00a0Home before we bought this place and love how they work here.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many things about the design that I love, and each component is like a puzzle piece that connects to a memory. The feature that I still find the most exciting is the countertop. Once we knew we\u2019d be relocating the sink, and nearly doubling the counter surface area in the process, I knew it was critical to choose the right material as it would be prominently featured. Thomas had shown us a space they were finishing with\u00a0a soapstone countertop and we inquired about the possibility of doing that in our space. They were more than willing to help us make that work and took us out to their supplier\u2019s stoneyard to look at slabs. While there, we saw the integrated countertop\/sink configuration on display and were sold. We also opted for a \u201cwaterfall\u201d edge which helped distinguish the kitchen\/dining areas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13112\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-05\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-05.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13113\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06\" width=\"600\" height=\"902\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-06-599x900.jpg 599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13114\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-07.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-07\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-07.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13115\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-08.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-08\" width=\"600\" height=\"902\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-08.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-08-599x900.jpg 599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13111\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-04\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-04.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13116\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-09.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-09\" width=\"600\" height=\"901\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-09.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-09-599x900.jpg 599w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13117\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-10.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-10\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-10.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-10-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would be lying if I said it was all completely painless, but as I look back, it\u2019s obvious that every trial we ran across, whether it be plumbing surprises or tile irregularities or whatever, we chose a design firm committed to making good on our contract together. They were as invested as we were in seeing the space come out the way we wanted and along the way the team at Sweeten (Jean and Shera) were both very much in the loop and always asking how they could assist. I doubt I will embark on another renovation anytime in the near future but if I did, I\u2019d certainly return to Sweeten and would recommend them to anyone looking to transform their home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thanks, Corey, for this tour of your gorgeous kitchen and\u00a0for your thoughtful\u00a0recollections of the journey.
