Ahead, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\">Sweeten<\/a>, a free service that matches renovators with general contractors outlines how to choose the best toilet for your bathroom renovation, highlighting sizes, styles, and features (including self-cleaning bowls). <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Determine the Toilet Size<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re replacing an existing toilet, you will need to find a model that matches the rough-in\u2014the distance from the wall to the center of the flange, the bolts that secure it to the floor. Twelve inches are standard, but you can find 10- and 14-inch models. The next measurement to consider is height. While standard bowls provide a rim from 14 to 15 inches high, \u201ccomfort height\u201d is also available, which sits 17 to 19 inches above the floor, to make getting on and off easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Choose Your Style<\/h3>\n<p><b>Bowl Shape<br \/>\n<\/b>Consider the bowl shape: A round bowl is classic. It also takes up less space than an elongated version, so it\u2019s good for a small bath or water closet. However, the elongated bowl provides greater room to sit and thus tends to be more comfortable.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you seek a contemporary style, look at toilets with a concealed or skirted trapway, to hides the contours of the base. Besides the sleek appearance, this version is easier to clean since there are fewer curves where dirt can collect.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>One-piece or two?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds like a bathing suit, but there are practical as well as stylistic reasons. A one-piece toilet takes up less space, is faster to install, and easier to clean since there is no seam to trap grime. However, all other features being the same, a two-piece is cheaper, plus its tank can be removed if you need to replace it or repair a pipe, whereas damage to a one-piece can mean the entire toilet would have to be replaced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find wall models with the tank concealed in the wall which speeds maintenance since you don\u2019t have to clean around the base. However, be aware that a wall-hung toilet requires breaking into the wall to hide the flushing mechanism which is an added cost to the budget. Also,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">access for repair is more complicated since the tank is not exposed.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-38626 size-full\" title=\"hexagon-tiles-on-bathroom-wall\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg\" alt=\"bathroom with rustic vanity and contemporary toilet and honeycomb or hexagon wall tiles and off white wall paint after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-12-723x1085.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nA one-piece toilet in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/zen-bathroom-renovation-windsor-terrace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten homeowner Erica&#8217;s bathroom<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Fashion colors<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with appliances, you won\u2019t find all styles in all colors, but you will find a nice range to choose from\u2014including the hue of the moment, gray\u2014if you want to go beyond white. A color will cost more, however, since whatever you choose won\u2019t be manufactured in the same quantities as white or even black. And since white remains the most popular color for baths, you\u2019ll enjoy plenty of options there, from cool to warm to ivory to bisque, to match your decor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t Forget About Flush Performance<\/h3>\n<p><b>Flushing mechanisms<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two choices: gravity feed and pressure-assisted: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as the term indicates, gravity feed uses gravity to send water through the rim of the toilet to force waste through the outlet pipe.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure-assisted employs compressed air or a small pump. Gravity feed tends to be quieter, while pressure-assisted claims to require less water to operate along with greater effectiveness removing solid waste. You can find some pressure-assisted models that use electricity to boost function, but keep in mind if there is a power outage, the toilet won\u2019t operate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Water conservation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two decades ago, the U.S. Department of Energy set a requirement for all newly manufactured toilets, restricting them to a maximum use of 1.6 gallons per flush. (Since then, the state of California has set a lower standard\u20141.28 gallons per flush.) Manufacturers met this requirement and, in fact, now some go as low as 0.9 gallons. As you shop, look for the WaterSense certification from the EPA, which indicates that the toilet uses no more than the standard 1.28 gallons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cr3uihyuiUo&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40927 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"85\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-OrderMaterials-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-OrderMaterials-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-OrderMaterials-1-600x51.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/h2>\n<h3>Other Toilet Features to Consider<\/h3>\n<p><b>Dual-flush options<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want worry-free performance from your toilet, but even with the EPA restrictions, you\u2019re aware of the ongoing need to conserve water, right? With dual flush, just as the term indicates, two buttons offer either the option of a partial flush for liquid waste or a complete flush for solid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Touchless flush<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motion sensors are no longer just for faucets and towel dispensers in a public washroom. The same type of touchless technology can now activate the flushing of your toilet with just the wave of a hand. Super convenient and ideal for hygienic considerations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Bidet or a combo?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a bath doesn\u2019t have room to add a bidet\u2014which takes up at least the width of another toilet\u2014manufacturers now offer a toilet\/bidet combo in some of their models. This added feature translates to as much as 10x the cost of a standard toilet, but think of all the money you\u2019ll save on toilet paper. Expect to find controls that offer different settings for water temperature, spray, and pressure, and also a drying mechanism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40372 size-full\" title=\"bidet toilet\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg\" alt=\"bidet toilet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/SWEETEN-Alice-Dang-Bathroom-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a>A toilet with a bidet seat in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/wet-room-renovation-pleasantville\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten homeowner Alice\u2019s Pleasantville, New York renovation<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Self-cleaning bowl<br \/>\n<\/b>While maintenance hasn\u2019t been completely eliminated, some toilets come with ceramic glazes that include antimicrobial ions to reduce germs. You can also find models that integrate self-cleaning systems that do some of the scrubbing labor for you (and eliminate those messy toilet brushes!), with a combination of nozzles to reduce daily waste buildup, as well as a cleaning cycle, which is to say a system of sprays that\u2014 at the press of a button\u2014interact with a cleaning solution emitted from a cartridge concealed in the tank.<\/p>\n<p><b>And more little extras<br \/>\n<\/b>It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the news in toilets was the soft-close seat.
