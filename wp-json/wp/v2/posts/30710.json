While looking for a 3-bedroom apartment, he discovered that the available units that met his criteria were too small. When he approached the building\u2019s management to see if there were any 2-bedroom apartments that could be combined into one, he learned that none of the units were eligible because of their shared walls. Instead of giving up, he asked them to double check with their architect. The architect came back with good news; units in the F and G lines could be combined. The homeowner bought units 22F and 22G, which are both located at the end of a hallway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The apartments had been renovated in a style that he felt was acceptable, but not as sleek of an aesthetic that he had in mind.\u00a0He set his sights on creating an efficient and modern home that was highly functional without sacrificing any comfort. The apartments were to be combined at the end of the hallway and through the walls that aligned with each unit\u2019s kitchen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30716 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30715\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After realizing that designating one of the two entrances as the main entrance would create an awkward flow,\u00a0he purchased 50 square feet of the hallway between the apartments to build a new entryway. \u201cIt was expensive,\u201d he said, \u201cbut worth it.\u201d Moving the entrance to the master exposed old wiring belonging to an outdated intercom system which was apparently still in use in a few of the much older apartments in the building.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Sweeten contractor had to hire<\/a> an expert in this kind of wiring to reroute it, which\u00a0he deemed a nuisance but not a huge deal.<\/p>\n<p>For the main living space, he envisioned an open-plan kitchen, family room, living room, and dining room that would give the space a loft-like feeling. The major elements of the renovation included opening the walls to combine the apartments and demolishing the two existing kitchens to build a completely new one. He also expanded the size and layout of the master bedroom and bathroom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30717 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30719\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-07\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The homeowner, who likes to cook, found out that moving the gas line in the kitchen to accommodate a Wolf gas stovetop would be too big of a challenge, so he opted for a Wolf convection\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stovetop<\/a>, which he\u2019s grown to love. \u201cIt&#8217;s modern, sleek, and boils a pot of water in seconds,\u201d he said. He also wanted to convert part of one of the old kitchens into a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">laundry room<\/a> and install stackable washer and dryer units, noting that the overall process was seamless and easy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30724 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-16-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-16\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30718 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-15-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-15\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30729\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the bathroom,\u00a0he wanted to create a mini spa with a walk-in shower, slate floor tile, and marble walls. One of the challenges he faced was converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower because it required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes to meet the code requirements. He expanded the bathroom by utilizing a nearby closet, which became difficult because he was placing a wet space over a dry space, and had to move the wiring to the main electrical box to make it work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30721 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-04\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30723 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-06\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30720\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the apartment,\u00a0he wanted to incorporate interesting design and architectural lighting. The fact that the building is postwar\u2014built in 1971\u2014meant that he couldn\u2019t drill into the slab. To solve this problem, he decided to drop the ceilings in most of the apartment by 4\u201d to 6\u201d inches to allow for recessed lighting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30725 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-18-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-18\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30726\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-20\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To warm up the family and living room part of the great room, he decided to add a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fireplace<\/a> that wouldn\u2019t require board approval to install. His search led him to a company called Hearth Cabinets, which has a patented technology that uses sterno-like gel to create a very realistic-looking fire. The fireplace meets all required codes and didn\u2019t require any sort of approval.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30727\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-13-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-13\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While renovating, he said he learned it\u2019s important to dot your &#8220;i\u2019s&#8221; and cross your &#8220;t&#8217;s.&#8221; \u201cDon&#8217;t be casual about what fixtures you choose or what you allow the contractor to do without input, especially if, like me, you want to do a very custom, high-end project,\u201d he said.

While he said he wouldn\u2019t choose to live through another renovation, he\u2019s thrilled with the end result of this one. Because the space is on the 22nd floor, it gets great natural light. The terraces, located on each end of the great room, provide a feeling of indoor and outdoor living. \u201cBeing in the room,\u201d the homeowner said, \u201cfeels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes two units are better than one!
