I\u2019ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn\u2019t had an upgrade since the building\u2019s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn\u2019t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building\u2019s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I\u2019d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Finding inspiration from other renovators<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people\u2019s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5415#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chose my Sweeten contractor<\/a> because his ideas matched mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47057\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg\" alt=\"pattern tile bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I\u2019ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen\u2019s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bids for a full kitchen remodel<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg\" alt=\"galley kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47056 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg\" alt=\"open shelving kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47055 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg\" alt=\"blue kitchen cabinetry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47059 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Transforming the bathroom wasn\u2019t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn\u2019t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material\u2014a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I\u2019m tall.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">A timely business trip<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The project\u2019s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I stayed for almost three weeks<\/a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I\u2019ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I\u2019m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<h3 class=\"p5\">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation\u2019s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to\u2014close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I\u2019ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it\u2019s so nice not to feel like I\u2019m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I\u2019m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs\u2014even my career\u2014in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Thank you, Michele, for sharing your bathroom and kitchen renovation tale with us!<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Materials Guide<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">KITCHEN RESOURCES:\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Rodano Acero floor tiles: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.porcelanosa-usa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Porcelanosa<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen cabinets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hanssemus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hanssem<\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Cabinet hardware: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hafele.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">H\u00e4fele<\/a>. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Countertops and backsplash in Frozen Terra: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caesarstoneus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Caesarstone<\/a>.
