We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons\u2019 schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen\u2014I always had been. I love taking\u00a0baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/15462\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post our renovation<\/a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this Sweeten contractor<\/a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22841 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/floorplan-723x560.png\" alt=\"floorplan\" width=\"723\" height=\"560\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22786 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22789 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22791 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22790 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22788 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22792 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-13.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-13\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22809 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22812 size-large\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN-Kimberly-Pantry.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN-Kimberly-Pantry\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it\u2019s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22787 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22793 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22795 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22794 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-22796 size-chrono\" title=\"Brooklyn renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Kimberly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn\u2019t going to work, so I learned to compromise. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor, \u00a0who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day.
