Digital controls, cycles tailored for everything from delicates to lycra\u00a0to bath towels, vibration reduction, and childproof locks make wash day safer and less of a chore. While innovation breakthroughs have not gone so far as to make washing machines touchless, like some other appliances, there are more than a few new features that further reduce the time spent while increasing efficiency. Here\u2019s a rundown:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The pros of front-loading<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The washing machine with the door that opens from the front, as opposed to the top, is not brand new; Europeans have enjoyed this feature for decades. However, it is becoming more widely available from manufacturers. The advantages: Front-loading machines require less water, can take more clothes, and tend to clean more gently and thoroughly than their top-loading counterparts. Top-loaders wash with the help of an agitator. Versions without the agitator are high-efficiency (HE) washers. Like front-loaders, they use less water, have larger capacities, require more time to wash, and spin faster, too, wringing out more water to save drying time later. They also cost more than the agitator version.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Automatic dispensers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This receptacle releases detergent, bleach, and fabric softener, each at the appropriate time, so you don\u2019t have to hang around waiting for just the right moment. Every minute saved is a minute you get back to do something else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Self-cleaning and low maintenance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Water will collect in the machine, particularly front-loading models, without evaporating if you wash frequently, creating a risk of mildew and bacteria. New technology now keeps washers fresh, without introducing chemicals, through a combination of soaking, pulsating, and high-speed spinning. And you thought self-clean was just for ovens!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23154 size-chrono\" title=\"two-in-one washer and dryer\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"washing machine\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Above) Tim and Lindsay&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two-in-one washer and dryer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Load capacity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Capacities for front- and top-loading machines can range from about 3.8 cubic feet up to 6 cubic feet. Your habits for doing laundry\u2014weekly loads of towels or sports clothes versus say, small loads separated by color\u2014will guide your decision. Larger capacity machines help cut down the number of washes you run. Expect to pay more for these models.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Steam wash<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Released from inside the washer, steam helps remove stains without pretreatment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Secondary access door<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a top loader and you stumble upon that missing dirty sock, no problem. But what if your machine is a front loader? Now you\u2019re in luck: Last year saw the introduction of a front-loading model with a secondary access door that lets you add small items mid-wash from Samsung.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27425 size-chrono\" title=\"washer and dryer\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-55-AFTER-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"washing machine\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Above) A\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">front-loading washer and dryer<\/a> in Cristiana&#8217;s\u00a0laundry room located in the basement of her home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Integrated sink<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve ever soaked clothing with a pesky stain, you\u2019ve probably had the experience of rushing with the drippy item from the sink to the washing machine, then going back to wipe up soapy water on the floor. No more. Samsung\u00a0makes a top-loading machine with a hinged sink on top of the wash drum. A water jet aids the soaking or scrubbing; when the item is ready for the wash, lift the sink to drop the clothing through a slot at the back and into the machine, then begin the cycle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Two-in-one machine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you like to wash small loads of a particular color, or can\u2019t wait to launder those sweaty gym clothes; the two-in-one machine is for you. In addition to a central or primary drum, there\u2019s another smaller drum at the base or top of the machine. You can run both washers simultaneously or independently, as needed. LG also offers a compact washer that can be retro-fitted to an existing machine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Black stainless steel finish<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Less industrial looking than its silvery-colored older sibling, black stainless steel makes a stylish statement in the laundry room, joining the ranks of ever-classic white, and some colors, too, which you may find on the market for a few seasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2014<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thinking about getting a washing machine for your home but not sure where to put it?
