One door opened to the apartment\u2019s foyer and one led to a windowed dining nook with shelving. Red floor tiles set a dark tone for the room and a prior renovation had missed the chance to extend the upper line of cabinetry toward the ceiling. Finishes aside, the extra dining space provided a few possibilities for new use. Opening the kitchen to the living room would create new bar seating and free Sarah and Oleg to re-purpose the dining nook as a small study. \u201cOne day\u2026\u201d was the thinking on the need for a nursery, so <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/1938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">they decided to post their project on Sweeten<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><strong>we matched them with Sweeten Expert Niki<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who brought close to twenty years of residential and commercial design experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18575\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-Before-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Niki and her team helped Sarah and Oleg get started with plans to update the kitchen, maximize space, and bring modern style and white finishes to the new open-concept living room. Cabinets and counters came down to make way for the wall removal between the kitchen and living room. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the kitchen newly open, the team began relocating appliances to create a more convenient U-shape, with a dining bar peninsula\u00a0serving as a partition between the two rooms. The sink stayed in place but the stove found a new home at one end of the kitchen, while a new stainless steel fridge bookends the other.\u00a0Niki installed deep storage cabinets and electrical outlets in the knee space of the island, utilizing every square inch necessary for purpose and function. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah and Oleg chose rows of light gray tile planks reminiscent of pale slate to line the kitchen floors, taking the place of the former brick-colored square tiles. Sarah knew she wanted finishes that were modern yet classic, and white cabinets topped the list. Niki specializes in crafting custom wood cabinetry, so she put these skills to good use for the couple, building and installing base and upper cabinets in clean white with crisp nickel knobs and drawer pulls. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The couple chose a muted\u00a0gray quartz for\u00a0the counters, and a stainless undermount sink with chrome faucet replaced the old set-up. Niki customized open shelving directly over the sink to offset cabinet uniformity, give easy access to everyday pieces, and give the kitchen a little more visual depth. The couple chose white subway tiles for their new backsplash, which reflect a bright glow thanks to under-cabinet lighting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18562 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01.jpg\" alt=\"open kitchen layout\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18566 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"gray quartz countertop\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-05.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18563 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"dining bar and island\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-02.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18565\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"modern LG kitchen appliances\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-04.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah and Oleg prioritized room for a double oven from LG and compensated for space with a counter-depth french\u00a0door Whirlpool fridge. A Whirlpool dishwasher rounded out the new appliances, and in keeping with the theme of \u201ctwos\u201d, Niki installed a pair of glass pendants over the bar top, which accessorize the new space beautifully. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the bonus room fashioned out of the former dining nook, Sarah and Oleg were more than pleased to find the new space fit not one but two cribs, perfect for new twin sisters, Ava and Sophie. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18567 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-06-07.gif\" alt=\"custom white cabinets\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-18564 mb-24 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"white subway tile backsplash\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18568\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-08-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gorgeous new space doesn&#8217;t let on that during the renovation process, a leak from a neighboring unit required extra work for the crew.
