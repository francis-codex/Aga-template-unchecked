That is also reflected in the cost of renovations.\u00a0<span style=\"color: #333333;\">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><strong>psf<span style=\"color: #333333;\">\u2014$250 <\/span>psf<\/strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">.

For instance, \u201cA presentation representing the finished product\u2014design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials\u2014is a service that adds to the budget.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you\u2019re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now.

This budget includes mid-grade finishes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s2\"><i>Remodeling<\/i>\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/middle-atlantic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s5\">Cost vs. Value report<\/span><\/a> puts <b>$350 psf<\/b> or <b>$70,000<\/b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li2\">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000<\/strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class=\"s2\"><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000<\/b> for a 200-square foot space. <\/span><span class=\"s7\">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000<\/b> on fully custom European cabinets.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"s2\">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>$16,000<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe\u2019s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"s2\">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average <\/span><span class=\"s3\"><b>$22,000<\/b>,<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf<\/b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"s2\">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000<\/strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.<\/strong><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. <\/b>A<b> $20,000\u2014$30,000 <\/b>or <b>$50\/psf <\/b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">renovated to a finished living area<\/a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000<\/b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot<\/b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000<\/b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project\u2019s cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000<\/b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20\u00d730 foot room, a 5&#8217;\u00d78&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf<\/b>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Costs for permits in Westchester<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"s3\">Pelham<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">: Building permits cost <b>$250<\/b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000<\/b> plus <b>$12<\/b> per each additional <b>$1,000<\/b>.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"s3\">Scarsdale<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">: Building permits cost<b> $255<\/b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000<\/b> and <b>$50,000<\/b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000<\/b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755<\/b> plus <b>$14<\/b> for each <b>$1,000<\/b> or fraction over <b>$100,000<\/b>.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"s3\">Katonah<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">: Permits cost <b>$14<\/b> for every <b>$1,000<\/b> of a budgeted project.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"s3\">Hastings-on-Hudson<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">: The fee will cost <b>$17<\/b> per <b>$1,000<\/b> of the estimated construction cost.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These figures provide a jumping-off point for your Westchester County renovation budget.
