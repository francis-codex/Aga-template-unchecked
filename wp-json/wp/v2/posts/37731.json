They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store.

It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn\u2019t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor\u2014especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. \u201cHe presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,\u201d Penny said.<\/p>\n<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. \u201cHis willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,\u201d Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she\u2019s learned to be more trusting of a contractor\u2019s advice, but also that it\u2019s important to speak up about what you\u2019re looking to achieve. \u00a0\u201cBe clear on what you want, don\u2019t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help\u2014they see a lot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bonus<\/strong><\/span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: \u201cGo with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,\u201d she said.<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br \/>\n<strong>Style finds<\/strong><\/span>:\u00a0Glass door: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hofmanglass.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hofman&#8217;s Glass<\/a>.
