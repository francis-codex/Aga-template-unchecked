We carefully select coffee cherries from around the world, which are roasted and brewed with love and passion. Our goal was to create a cozy space in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Here, you can engage with your barista while enjoying a coffee from our weekly rotating menu of single-origin beans and pastries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot:<\/strong> Clovelly Coffee is a caf\u00e9 inspired by Clovelly, a Sydney beachside suburb and my Australian hometown.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> What led to the opening of this new brick-and-mortar space?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot:<\/strong> After making the move to Manhattan with my wife, we quickly connected with this vibrant city and the New Yorkers who shared the love for coffee.<\/p>\n<p>As a working chef in Sydney, I ran my first successful caf\u00e9 for five years. Now in New York, Clovelly is a family-owned business and my second venture in continuing my passion for coffee and food with an Aussie edge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How does your new caf\u00e9 design and the materials used represent your brand?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot:<\/strong> The design of the space has a distinct beach-y feel. The use of white evokes an Aussie beachside caf\u00e9 feel with gold\/brass finishes. By adding splashes of yellow and blue (pulling from the colorful textures found at Clovelly Beach), we recreated the golden sun and sand and the blue in the Pacific Ocean from our hometown.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweeten:<\/strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot:<\/strong> Our contractor was instrumental in the process. They helped us find solutions in real-time and helped us stay on budget. They also offered alternatives to issues that arose.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a small space, we had challenges fitting in plumbing pipes.
