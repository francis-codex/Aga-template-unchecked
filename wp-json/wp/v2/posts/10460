The couple, both creative professionals in advertising, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/807\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted on Sweeten<\/a> to find someone who could help convert the derelict roof into an extension of their home &#8212; an outdoor room with comfortable seating and plants to soften up the space. We introduced them to a few matches, and before long, they awarded their project to Sweeten member Hutson Landscape, owned by Corey Hutson, whose expertise in landscape design &amp; construction was a perfect fit.\u00a0When we stopped by to see how the project turned out, Nate, Michelle, and their bouncy labradoodle, &#8220;Kid,&#8221; were setting up to host some friends on their renovated roof.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10465 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-1c.png\" alt=\"greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-1c.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-1c-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10466 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-1c.png\" alt=\"greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-1c.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-1c-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In just 2 months, Corey and his team were able to turn the bleak roof space into a polished outdoor room. The homeowners selected plantings based on Corey&#8217;s recommendations: lavender &amp; feather reed grass to line the perimeter, and a Japanese Maple tree to frame the skyline view. The tall feather reed grass is nice for adding a little privacy, and when the wind blows, Michelle says, &#8220;it sounds like palm trees,&#8221; which she loves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The homeowners also told us that Corey suggested bringing a water line up to their roof so that they&#8217;d have easy access for watering the plantings and keeping Kid&#8217;s bowl full &#8212; something they never would have thought of themselves.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10467 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-2c.png\" alt=\"greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-2c.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/01_before-2c-300x194.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10468 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-2c.png\" alt=\"greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-2c.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/02_after-2c-300x194.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To furnish, Nate &amp; Michelle selected a pair of outdoor sofas and matching side tables from Room &amp; Board, and to extend their use of the space into the fall, they also purchased a fire pit that converts to a coffee table when covered (not pictured).\u00a0The setup is perfect for transitioning from lounging in the sun with a book, to hosting a party; Kid is also more than content, with plenty of space to play tug-of-war (and lots of cushions to warm as well).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10469 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/03_after-3c.png\" alt=\"greenpoint-roof-deck-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/03_after-3c.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/03_after-3c-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Jealousy.
