With a tenant living in my NJ home, I\u2019d been renting a place in Bed-Stuy for more than two years and I figured it was time to try to fulfill my goal of owning in Brooklyn.\u00a0My new place was a sponsor unit\u00a0on a high floor with expansive east-facing views. The kitchen had (what seemed at the time) pretty good upgrades: black granite counters, black tile flooring, and new stainless steel appliances. The cabinets, though not my favorite style, were perfectly fine. My friends were pretty impressed with my new digs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u00a0did have the chance to take down the\u00a0zig-zagging wall partition that separated the kitchen from the living room during contract negotiations,\u00a0but I was too indecisive and stressed from the purchasing process to pull the trigger. At the time, most of my efforts in the kitchen involved making toast and coffee, so being a little cramped didn&#8217;t seem like an issue. But after closing, I sank into a brief period of buyer\u2019s remorse. Those cabinets, which had seemed just fine, were actually pretty shabbily installed: nothing was level, the hinges had paper stuffed into them to make them close properly, and the fridge was jammed in between the counter and the kitchen wall. When I opened the fridge doors, they would hit the doorway and chip away at the door frame.\u00a0I was totally bummed.\u00a0Hoping for a quick fix,\u00a0I contacted the folks who\u2019d done the work to re-do the entryway and replace the refrigerator, but I wasn\u2019t any happier with how it all looked after that second try.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"images-of-kitchen-before-renovation\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47848 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg\" alt=\"two images of kitchen with oak cabinets and black floor tiles and black granite countertop and undermount sink before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"images-of-kitchen-before-renovation\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47849 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg\" alt=\"two images of kitchen with oak cabinets and granite countertop and stainless steel gas range next to a window before renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-Before-2-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few months in, I\u00a0started to see a\u00a0recurring water leak from the neighbors upstairs &#8211; more than once, water poured down through my\u00a0cabinets,\u00a0causing the kitchen walls and cabinet\u00a0surfaces to bow and fade.\u00a0By this point, I was pretty down on the kitchen. I&#8217;d already removed some of the damaged cabinetry from the wall and had lived for a year with an entire section missing. I knew I wanted to\u00a0renovate, but\u00a0I hesitated with the potential cost and the fear of another flood.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I learned that some of my neighbors had gone through\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0to find contractors for their renovations and I was surprised and encouraged by the variety of configurations available for what felt like a pretty limited space.\u00a0So I finally\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/3555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted my project on Sweeten<\/a>,\u00a0envisioning\u00a0a grown-up kitchen with an island\/peninsula, fully open to the living room. I didn\u2019t really have a vision for what I wanted besides something that would play well with the living room d\u00e9cor. I like warm colors, oranges and browns, and I specified that I needed experts who could handle both the design and build of the space. Sweeten introduced me to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3207\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert<\/a>, and I liked them immediately. Paulina\u00a0has a great attitude and personality, plus she\u2019s a trained architect with design ideas that make so much sense.\u00a0She seemed as excited about designing it as I was, so it was an easy decision to move\u00a0forward\u00a0with the team.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During our first design meeting, we talked color scheme and finishes. What blew my mind was that the very next night, Paulina sent me sketches that\u00a0basically represented what the kitchen looks like now that it is completed.\u00a0I\u2019d read references from other clients about Paulina on Sweeten that talked about how she was very reliable and would take care of everything. And that\u2019s absolutely\u00a0true. As someone who had never done a major home project, I was freaking out a little bit over how overwhelming it all seemed.\u00a0\u00a0But after visiting Paulina and Albert&#8217;s shop in Queens, I was so encouraged and relieved, knowing I was working with real professionals. At that meeting, we picked the cabinetry style and she gave me two samples for countertop material and two options for cabinet lacquer color, totally respecting my wish to not be deluged with choices. She also talked me out of unnecessarily changing the kitchen floor, one of the best cost- and time-saving decisions of the reno.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"pendant-lights-hanging-from-wood-plank\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47850 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-1.jpg\" alt=\"peninsula kitchen island with natural wood base and marble countertop and pendant lights hanging from wood plank after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"kitchen-island-with-pendant-lights\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47851 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-6.jpg\" alt=\"small kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and natural wood island with marble countertop and pendant lights after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-6.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-6-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once work started, everything seemed to happen very fast.\u00a0Paulina&#8217;s designs pulled in my color\u00a0scheme across the custom solid wood cabinets, painted to color-match Benjamin Moore&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\/redirects\/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=earlymorningmist&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Early Morning Mist<\/a>. Albert created\u00a0a\u00a0walnut veneer, open corner cabinet above the sink, and continued the walnut accents with a soffit, floor to\u00a0ceiling pipe cover, and dining peninsula. I found the recycled glass penny tile backsplash at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.completetile.com\/products\/glass\/zumi_glass\/color_sizes_and_specifications\/34-penny-round\/zumi-glass-mosaic-cypress-brown-natural-complete-tile-collection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Complete Tile<\/a>\u00a0in Manhattan &#8211;\u00a0exactly what I was looking for &#8211; and I also chose the quartzite counters in Madreperola\/Mother of Pearl. The stone is my favorite thing about the new space &#8211; it&#8217;s like having a piece of fine art right in my kitchen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I chose a simple\u00a0metallic bronze knob for the cabinets from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.myknobs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">myknobs.com<\/a>\u00a0and I picked up door\u00a0handles for the storage under the dining\u00a0peninsula from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.overstock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Overstock<\/a>. Paulina\u00a0recommended some very cool pendant lights from Restoration Hardware and I found a budget-friendly alternative from\u00a0Brooklyn Bulb Co.\u00a0To solve a space issue, I decided to replace my dishwasher with an 18-inch\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosch-home.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bosch<\/a>\u00a0model, allowing Paulina and\u00a0Albert to create two full lines of base cabinets along the kitchen&#8217;s back wall.\u00a0The dividing wall came down (you can see my boyfriend&#8217;s little farewell graffiti from the night before the demo!), the cabinet bases went in, the soffit and pipe cover were installed, and the next thing I knew, the counters were brought in and we were just about done.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I never thought I could or would have such a funky kitchen.\u00a0I would say I\u2019m most appreciative toward Sweeten and Paulina and Albert for making this process, for the most part, worry-free.\u00a0Paulina and Albert stuck to my budget and managed to keep the project on schedule\u00a0despite my kitchen&#8217;s persistent attempts to put us behind with some unhelpful wall crookedness.\u00a0The craftsmanship of the kitchen is fantastic and apparent, from the way the floor was seamlessly patched to the super cool way the cabinets are finished underneath with LED lights, to the bonus upper and lower cabinets next to the stove (which also cleverly hide pipes). I love the wee pull-out spice cabinet!\u00a0I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it\u2019s like a minor miracle happened with this project.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-cabinets-and-wooden-shelves\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47852 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-3.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen cabinets and open shelves and marble countertop with undermount sink after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-3-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-kitchen-cabinets-with-marble-countertop\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47853 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-7.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen cabinets with marble countertop and undermount sink and backsplash and shelves above sink after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-7.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-7-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"shades-of-brown-gray-backsplash\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47854 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-8.jpg\" alt=\"shades of brown and gray mosaic backsplash that are hexagon shaped and marble countertop in a kitchen after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-8.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-8-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"custom-spice-cabinet-next-to-range\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47855 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-4.jpg\" alt=\"custom spice cabinet next to gas range and window sill after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-4.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-4-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"narrow-kitchen with-white-and-oak-cabinets\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-47856\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-2.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors and a peninsula island with natural wood cabinets after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Ketrina-Kitchen-After-2-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Bravo, Ketrina!
