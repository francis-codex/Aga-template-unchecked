Looking for our next place, we realized that everything in our price range needed a large overhaul, or had been cheaply flipped and had an ugly poorly-designed kitchen.<\/p>\n<h3>Seeking a fixer-upper kitchen<\/h3>\n<p>I love to cook, and during our search, we\u2019d decided that the sweet spot would be a place that was in good shape and had character but <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-west\/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">needed a new kitchen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As first-time renovators, we figured the hardest parts would be finding a contractor, negotiating bids, and avoiding surprise hidden costs. When we found <em>the one<\/em> on <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, it turned out our biggest challenge was actually <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not hiring an architect or designer<\/a> as well. I sketched the kitchen out on my word processor!<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"golden-oak-cabinets-farmhouse-sink\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg\" alt=\"golden oak kitchen cabinets with butcher block countertop and undermount farmhouse sink and white backsplash after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51359 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"undermount-farmhouse-sink-white-backsplash\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen windows over undermount farmhouse sink with black faucets and wooden countertop and white backsplash tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51366 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-600x800.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thinking we would <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">re-do the kitchen<\/a> right away, we purchased an induction hotplate and set it on the beautiful black-and-teal tile countertop. We found a basic fridge on Craigslist. We would also need to upgrade the unit\u2019s electrical panel; we didn\u2019t have the amps to run the hotplate and toaster simultaneously. When we first moved in, a kitchen wall had to be ripped out due to a leaky roof. It stayed that way until the renovation; it was rough in there!<\/p>\n<h3>Flooring material for wet spaces<\/h3>\n<p>We thought about trying to save the Art Deco details, especially the original tile countertops and the matching backsplash. But preserving the original aesthetic wasn\u2019t an option. The counters weren\u2019t the modern standard depth, so new appliances would not fit. We struggled with whether to go with deco tiles and white cabinets or scrap all that and let it be something modern. We went with the latter.<\/p>\n<p>Going from the ground up, we discussed adding hardwood or cork flooring for a soft surface underfoot but decided against it. We wanted to make the kitchen contiguous with the laundry room, and we chose cement tile flooring to avoid worries about moisture. Another draw had to do with dirt. In our old apartment, we\u2019d had terracotta tiled floors, which we loved, but the wide grout collected grime. The cement tile required narrower grout and seemed practical. It also brought a bold texture to our floors.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"white-kitchen-patterened-floor-tiles\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"white kitchen with patterened floor tiles and golden oak cabinets and butcher block countertop and range hood after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51357 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-03-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"patterened-floor-tiles-kitchen\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-04.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen with golden oak cabinets and stainless steel appliances and patterened floor tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51358 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-04-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-04-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Plywood cabinets and cement floor tile ground the kitchen<\/h3>\n<p>Having ruled out natural wood for the floors, we were excited to use it for the cabinets. We feel intuitively drawn to wood and have chosen it for surfaces throughout our home, so we let that lead us. We went with plywood kitchen cabinets\u2014it&#8217;s a cost-effective material, and we liked its functional aesthetic. Designing the layout for the custom base plywood cabinets was gratifying. Since we could dictate all dimensions, we spent time going over all of our kitchen wares and deciding how we wanted to store things. We\u2019d measured the height of the coffee grinder and Chemex pitcher and knew which drawer they would live in long before the kitchen was built.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span>&#8220;Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We thought a lot about the upper cabinetry, too. We initially felt nervous about open shelving, thinking everything would get dusty. But in the end, we did it, mainly to save money, and it turned out to be a great choice to keep the visuals simple and open. It makes putting away dishes a breeze!<\/p>\n<h3>Personalized features make it home<\/h3>\n<p>The backsplash was also cost-contingent. We kept saying we\u2019d do subway tile to save money\u2014but decided on handmade, natural clay tiles that look so right with the plaster walls. Plastering the hood was another important detail for us; it became a way to draw the co-op\u2019s original character into our modern design.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"breakfast-station-near-laundry\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-06.jpg\" alt=\"small breakfast station with storage and backsplash near laundry room after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51360 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-06-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-06-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"laundry-room-white-cabinets\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-08.jpg\" alt=\"laundry room with white cabinets and geometric patterned tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51362 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-08-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-08-600x800.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t agree on everything. My uphill battle was to convince Matt to spend the extra money to put in taps for filtered and boiling water. As the cook of the house and the one who drinks the most water, I felt strongly that this would pay off in convenience. Matt finally agreed, and it really has.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing touches for the laundry<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">laundry room was another area<\/a> where plumbing was key, and our Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ca\/los-angeles-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractor got involved<\/a> there, too. We\u2019d installed cabinets ourselves above the washer and dryer before starting the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen renovation<\/a>. However, the washer and dryer, which were included in the house purchase, had exposed hookups. We upgraded by having the contractor recess them into the wall. The dryer had been vented through a hole in the floor that looked like it was cut with a Sawzall, so we finished that, too. We invested in an on-demand hot-water heater and installed an $85 utility sink. Someday we\u2019d like to get front-loading machines and put in a countertop to really pull that room together.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"small-pantry-patterened-tiles\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-10.jpg\" alt=\"small pantry storage with wooden shelves and geometric patterned tiles after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51364 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-10-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-10-600x800.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"laundry-storage-utility-sink\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-09.jpg\" alt=\"laundry area with utility sink and white cabinets and storage area after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-51363 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-09-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-09-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Good communication with their general contractor<\/h3>\n<p>Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky.
