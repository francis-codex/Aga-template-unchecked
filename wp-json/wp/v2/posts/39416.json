I&#8217;ve worked for prominent international\u00a0architectural and management firms\u00a0on major\u00a0and medium size projects. This allowed me to understand the important\u00a0advantages of a design-build type of contracts and become a design-build contractor myself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about your work?<\/strong><br \/>\nI&#8217;m passionate about my work. I love every aspect of it, but I particularly enjoy the design stage and the one-on-one collaboration with my clients. Homes are very personal and private, and commercial spaces are important for a successful business. That is why I encourage homeowners and business owners, who have the time, to be a part of the design process. Most of the time, they appreciate this because it gives them the feeling as though they are building their own place. Giving time and attention to our clients opens the door to a good relationship, promotes good communication, and clarifies the issues in a comprehensive and progressive manner. All these things are crucial for the success of the project.<\/p>\n<p>I also love details. They make a difference in the project and are part of the challenges that much of the time call for special attention and creativity to address them. But the\u00a0real pleasure is when I start seeing the fruit of so many hours of work and collaboration with my clients taking shape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who is your ideal client?<\/strong><br \/>\nMy ideal client is\u00a0one who is curious enough to\u00a0get involved in the design process and become a &#8220;partner&#8221; in the project development. To help that happen and as construction progresses, I send my clients pictures with comments and wait for their reactions. They love that! Most of the time, they come back with smileys and\/or kind words of approval. But true satisfaction comes when construction is finished, and I see and hear real appreciation from the client.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-35914 size-full\" title=\"a licensed contractor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-Contractor.jpg\" alt=\"hiring a licensed contractor\" width=\"975\" height=\"193\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-Contractor.jpg 975w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-Contractor-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-Contractor-600x119.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GCs_Embeds-Contractor-723x143.jpg 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?<\/strong><br \/>\nAdministrative work with the city, building management companies, and\/or third party project reviewers who sometimes waste the homeowner&#8217;s time and money and cause unnecessary delays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><br \/>\nBudget. It is normal that homeowners want to get the best quality\u00a0for the least cost\u2014until it becomes somewhat unrealistic. We always remind the homeowner that this is New York City and things are expensive. But most importantly, we try to show them what drives cost and why, so they understand that what they are paying is justified by and proportionate with what they are asking to have in their project.<\/p>\n<p>But ultimately, we implement value engineering that helps the homeowner set a list of priorities based on need vs. cost and budget. We walk them through the process of selecting the most important items they need or elements they want to have at the best price possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<\/strong><br \/>\nI would like the homeowners to know that what we do is real design-build where everything is done in-house. We do not resource design, construction, and management.\u00a0We take care of the administrative work and obtain all necessary permits to make sure the whole process is seamless, stress-free, and fun.<\/p>\n<p>We manage time in such a way that by the time permits and approvals are acquired, most decisions related to design, equipment, appliances, fixtures, and materials have been made. We also work in 3D as part of our basic cost. We share all of our ideas with our clients in this fashion because we understand that, by definition, homeowners are not construction professionals and they rely on us. So we always go the extra mile to help them see what their space will look like before we put the first hammer in the wall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Hearst Building for being the first NYC Platinum\u00a0Labelled\u00a0Green building; Ground Zero Memorial for its poignant architecture that revisits and displays very strongly the emotions of 9\/11; 432 Park Avenue for its audacious height vs. its narrow footprint, plus its other successfully resolved technical challenges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe West Village and Soho.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?<\/strong><br \/>\nA Mediterranean shawarma and falafel place that I&#8217;m designing.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><em><br \/>\nTake a look at some of Camille\u2019s renovations below\u00a0and check out\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his portfolio<\/a>\u00a0for more photos of past work.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-39433\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/SWEETEN-Camille-Projects.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n(1) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Melissa&#8217;s<\/a> kitchen and bathroom on the Upper West Side (3) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/custom-bookcases-prewar-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cat and Jordan&#8217;s<\/a> living room and kitchen in Fort Greene, Brooklyn<\/div>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Camille has been a Sweeten general contractor since 2016.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\u2014<\/div>\n<div><em><br \/>\nSweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
