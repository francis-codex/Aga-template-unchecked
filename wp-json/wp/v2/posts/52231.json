The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character\u2014our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.<\/span><\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg\" alt=\"Galley kitchen with bar seating and black cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52149\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/67197\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted our project on Sweeten<\/a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn\u2019t long before we found <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/5676#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a contractor we felt was a great fit<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms\u2019 shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated\u2014we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo\u2019s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg\" alt=\"View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52151\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg\" alt=\"Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ideas-and-inspiration\/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage<\/a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets\u2014they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they\u2019re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began\u2014she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world\u2019s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don\u2019t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand\u2014this fridge holds seven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg\" alt=\"Black cabinets, stainless steel appliances, white marble counters, natural wood shelving\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52153\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05.jpg\" alt=\"Black kitchen cabinets with white backsplash and counter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Wallpaper and black paint for a bathroom<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">went with a statement wallpaper<\/a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with walk-in shower, vanity, and large mirror\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1499\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52156\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Managing during the home remodel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w<\/span><span class=\"s1\">e retreated to Danielle\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn\u2019t conducive to phone calls\u2014we didn\u2019t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> <\/span><span class=\"s1\">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was hard not being able to see the project\u2019s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating\u2014ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with black and white walls and vanity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52154\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom with glass shower door and black matte hardware\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn\u2019t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tips on staying on budget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is\u2014the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn\u2019t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you\u2019re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We\u2019ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Danielle and Michelle, for sharing the results of your Hoboken home remodel with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Renovation Materials:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Cement Nord hex porcelain tile: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tileshop.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">Tile Shop<\/span><\/a>.
