I served in the U.S. Army and am a veteran of the Iraq war. I have been running my construction business for 10 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>\u00a0How did you get into the industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always loved woodworking and have done it as a pastime since I was young. When I moved to New York City to work on Wall Street (I studied investment finance in college), a lot of my new not-so-handy friends seemed to need help around their apartments. I ended up building a few things out of wood to fit in custom spaces where store-bought items wouldn\u2019t work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This led to my work getting noticed and I started getting recommended for more projects. Slowly I was introduced to designers, decorators, realtors, and architects. I went from being a handy helping hand to a licensed contractor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, I would learn every trade in the interior remodeling field, soaking up my staff\u2019s expertise, asking a lot of questions, reading countless trade books, and pulling all-nighters to study up. I have never looked back; I find my construction independence to be much more fulfilling than holding a job in finance. I wrote a book on the construction industry in 2015.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you love most about construction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem-solving. I love taking an idea and turning it into a functional reality. Designers and clients look to me for ideas on how to turn a thought into an item that lives in their home. Also, issues arise on a consistent basis on job sites and I love figuring out solutions. Most times, we can take care of the issue before the homeowner even knows. That is very satisfying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Who is your ideal client?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One who doesn\u2019t micromanage our work. They have their own job and they respect ours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Space (there is very little room to work and spread out the necessary tools), getting around the city (it is tough to deliver and remove materials), and restrictions imposed by buildings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The length of the project. These days everyone watches home remodeling shows on TV and not only do they think they know how to manage a construction project but they also have unrealistic expectations based on skewed realities seen on \u201cnot-so-real\u201d reality television.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m here for you. Let me worry for you. Let me make sure things stay on track. Stress shouldn\u2019t be your job; it\u2019s mine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Grand Central Station.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The East Village.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could I plug my bar? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.harlemnights.nyc\/\">Harlem Nights.<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40819 mb-10\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Claud-Fatu-Projects.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>Claud has been a Sweeten contractor since 2014.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
