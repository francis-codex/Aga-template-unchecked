Below, Sweeten outlines the reasons behind upfront payment amounts, and some options for negotiating your deposit for a contractor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why do contractors require a deposit?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Deposits for contractors are critical because they essentially allow your project to begin! Your general contractor needs to secure a crew and begin <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordering materials right away<\/a>. They may also need to rent equipment. And your contractor can\u2019t take on all the financial liability for these commitments themself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much of a deposit can a contractor ask for? <\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The exact deposit amount contractors ask for upfront varies and is especially dependent on the size of the project. For relatively small jobs, like a $16,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/bathroom\/renovations\/\">bathroom remodel<\/a>, contractors may ask for a 50% deposit. For large jobs, like a $100,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\">full-home renovation<\/a>, a 10%\u201320% deposit is more typical.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Is the deposit for a contractor negotiable?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It might be. In many cases, contractors start with a standardized contract, so some of the terms could be based on a typical job rather than the specifics of yours. You may be able to ask for somewhat lower initial payment or deposit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The ideal time to ask is during negotiations (\u2014an important part of <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\">the contractor hiring process<\/a>), before the contractor drafts the contract. But they may be amenable to a minor contract alteration after the fact. Just know that their flexibility may be limited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What about the remaining payments?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">General contractors use a number of different fee structures. The payment schedule might be based on fixed dates, or on major project milestones. For small jobs, they\u2019ll typically ask for just two payments\u2014one upfront, the other at the end. For larger projects, there may be as many as five scheduled payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most contractors ask for the final payment upon \u201csubstantial completion.\u201d This means that everything\u2019s complete except the punch list*, and possibly final work on minor finishes. Occasionally, a contractor will consider a job substantially complete when there\u2019s a single large outstanding item\u2014like an expensive fixture that\u2019s held up by a shipping delay, but which won\u2019t require much labor to install. When you&#8217;re ready to begin your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\">find a vetted and experienced contractor<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">*The punch list is a tally of any minor problems for the contractor to fix\u2014like a paint splatter, a missing drawer pull, a misaligned cabinet hinge, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Points to remember for contractor deposits:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Expect to pay a deposit for a contractor before work can begin<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Expect to pay a higher percentage on a smaller job, and vice-versa<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Discuss the contractors&#8217; deposit and payment schedule before they draft the contract<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019d like to amend the contract, don\u2019t expect the contractor to have unlimited flexibility<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul><\/ul>\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re planning to start your own home renovation within the next 6 months, it\u2019s time to post your project on Sweeten and start making your vision a reality!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" class=\"elementor-button-link\"><span>Start your renovation with Sweeten<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>How does Sweeten connect me with the best general contractors for my remodeling project?<\/h3>\n<p>Our purpose at Sweeten is to help homeowners transform their homes as seamlessly as possible \u2014 so you can stop living at home, and start thriving!
