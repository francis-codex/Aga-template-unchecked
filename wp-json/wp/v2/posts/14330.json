So you&#8217;re wondering: what does it <\/span><span class=\"s2\">cost to replace electrical wiring<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> in a home? <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten offers some tips and expert advice about electrical work and potential costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Because electrical magic happens behind walls, forecasting the scope of additions and <\/span><span class=\"s2\">costs to update electrical wiring <\/span><span class=\"s1\">can be challenging. Those cost estimates are also crucial if you\u2019re budgeting for a renovation or for a new home purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">How do I know what kind of electrical work a place needs?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Analyzing the existing electrical<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractors will first examine the electrical panel (or \u201cbox\u201d) to determine circuit load capacity. In other words, what more can the existing wiring handle? Experienced contractors can generally tell by looking at the circuits what can and cannot be done. That is, do you need to add more capacity to the existing system? Or, upgrade to a larger panel because slots for breakers are full?<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Electrical needs for older homes<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pre-war apartments that haven\u2019t been updated in decades often need significant electrical re-wiring and additional wattage to support modern electrical demands. Many NYC buildings constructed through the early part of the twentieth century were multi-layered with older wiring systems. Some have ungrounded systems that lack code-approved grounding conductors. Others have metallic insulation materials like aluminum or copper wiring that may actually increase the chances of electrical shock or fire. These older wiring systems, typically with 60 to 100 amps of service, violate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/dob\/downloads\/bldgs_code\/electrical_code_local_law_39of2011.pdf\"><span class=\"s4\">current electrical codes<\/span><\/a>. They also fall short of the standard minimum of 200 amps generally needed to power a home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">According to N.Y.-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten general contractor Frank<\/a>, \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of new services, and I recommend having new electrical. When you spend X amount of dollars on the apartment renovation, you need everything to be working.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Ultimately, the electrical code determines what\u2019s required, and it\u2019s highly detailed. Each room must have a light fixture, for example, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors must be hardwired. (This is because battery-powered models are not allowed.) This evaluation of your system is part of your walk-through with your general contractor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">What if I just want to install new appliances?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Installing air conditioners, appliances, or entertainment systems may seem simple. However, these can quickly overwhelm an older building\u2019s capacity. Your home\u2019s electrical load capacity is like a surge protector on a much larger scale. If you have too many wires plugged into an outlet, the circuit may overload. That leads to tripped breakers and blown fuses that shut down all power. So, if your electrical system is not capable of handling the additional load, a relatively straightforward appliance installation could become a much more invasive and substantial project. Installing a new electrical circuit panel or a complete overhaul of the electrical wiring may be possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One clear example is air conditioning. \u201cFor homes without central AC,\u201d general contractor Frank noted, \u201cyou have to run a dedicated line in every room for an AC unit. It could be either a wall unit or a window unit, but each room has to have a dedicated outlet for the AC unit.\u201d Kitchens and bathrooms are not included in this requirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Each circuit is wired from that AC unit to the panel with no other devices drawing power from it. That can add up to a substantial amount of new wiring to meet code, and it\u2019s not optional. The entire system must be brought up to code, whether or not you install an AC unit. As for cost for this project, it\u2019s highly variable and, as always, depends partly on the panel having capacity for new circuits. A dedicated line, Frank said, \u201cwould run between <strong>$300<\/strong> and <strong>$1,000<\/strong>.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">How does rewiring work?\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The electrical rewiring process<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If your place is in for a full electrical upgrade, you need to plan and budget for a labor-intensive and disruptive process. Your electrician will temporarily shut off power and your contractor will open up the walls. Since wires are attached to framing within the walls, rewiring can be very invasive. Your team might completely demolish entire walls to access all the old wires and replace them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One type of surprise for homeowners, said <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten general contractor Mohsen<\/a>, who is based in New York, is framing changes. Bringing older homes and apartments up to modern standards may require adjusting the existing framing to accommodate new equipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\">\u201c<\/span><span class=\"s6\">What is behind the ceiling? Do we have enough space for recessed lights?\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have enough space for the fan? Choosing a fan that doesn\u2019t fit the space may require reframing. Sometimes dropping the entire bathroom ceiling for the fan can also be a surprise,\u201d Mohsen added.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">How much will <\/span><span class=\"s2\">electrical wiring cost<\/span><span class=\"s1\">?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">Budgeting for an electrical overhaul<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">To finish, the walls are plastered and painted. The electrician connects the remaining switches and outlets, closes up the new electrical panel, and installs light fixtures. The full <\/span><span class=\"s2\">electrical wiring cost<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> <\/span><span class=\"s1\">of this kind of project, with demolition, permits, labor, materials, construction, and painting can cost from<b> $15,000 and up<\/b> depending on the size of your space and extent of work. If you are gut-renovating an entire home, a full electrical overhaul might represent somewhere around <strong>5%<\/strong> <strong>of your total budget<\/strong>. If your renovation is limited to a particular room (like a kitchen), a full electrical overhaul may end up matching or exceeding the total cost of the project you&#8217;re planning. The <\/span><span class=\"s2\">costs to update electrical wiring in a home<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> involve more than just electrical work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Rewiring aside, what else might I need for electrical work?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractors assess electrical needs and costs for clients based on a series of questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">1. What is already in place vs. what you are trying to accomplish?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Identify what kind of light fixtures or electrical systems are in place and what\u2019s not there. If you want to install lighting, put in a security system, or run a phone line in a particular location that doesn\u2019t have existing wiring, contractors have to perform an electrical \u201crough-in.\u201d\u00a0 That is the preliminary step to lay out the basic wiring to proper specifications before connections and insulation are completed<\/span><span class=\"s7\">. The rough-in cost is generally calculated by the length of the wiring lines installed (linear feet running from the circuit box to the point where outlets and switches are mounted), the cost of materials, and the labor rate. Rough-ins might also be charged at a flat rate of <b>$250\u2013$400 <\/b>per junction box, outlet, or switch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">2. What type of light fixtures and finishes do you want and how many do you need?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractors charge labor costs that include running cables to devices and connecting wiring to circuit boxes based on the number and type of fixtures you want to install. Generally, swapping an old light fixture for a new one comes in at around <b>$100 <\/b>per fixture or at an hourly fee. Installing new fixtures like pendants and recessed LED lights comes in at around <b>$200\u2013$400<\/b> per fixture and larger, heavier fixtures like chandeliers cost in the range of <b>$500\u2013$800<\/b> per fixture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">3. How much amp service does your electrical panel hold?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Electrical panels in NYC usually hold 200 amps of service, so if your electrical service is short of that, the system won\u2019t have enough power or space in the circuit box to accommodate new demands. In this case, you need to upgrade your electrical panel, which can cost <b>$2,000<\/b> to <b>$5,000 and up<\/b> for a new box<i>.<\/i> If you have an existing electrical panel with enough room for new circuits but you\u2019re planning a renovation that might add some heavy-duty appliances, you may want to consider adding a new circuit breaker, which typically costs <b>$300<\/b> to <b>$800<\/b> per breaker in order to accommodate a higher electrical capacity load. Adding a new circuit to the panel allows you to install more outlets, which generally cost around <b>$100<\/b> to <b>$300<\/b> per outlet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Frank noted that older homes with outdated service may present an unwelcome surprise if the service to the house is inadequate. He recently completed a project that required new 200-amp service from the street, as the existing service was only 80 amps. That new service required the electric company to run a new buried line to the house, and also required trenching in the yard and a new poured concrete sidewalk. All that work cost the homeowners <strong>$5,000<\/strong> before Frank could even get to work inside the home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Permits and processes for electrical work<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For anything other than a fixture swap or a straightforward appliance installation, you will need an electrician licensed by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/buildings\/index.page\"><span class=\"s4\">Department of Buildings<\/span><\/a> who must first file an electrical application and pay permit fees in order to conduct electrical work. Once a permit is obtained, an inspection must take place, and a certificate is mailed to ensure that the work was properly completed and inspected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The <\/span><span class=\"s8\">cost to replace electrical wiring<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> is hugely variable. Balancing current wiring with future needs while meeting code is complex and requires a competent professional electrician.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
