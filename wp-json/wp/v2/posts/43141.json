You\u2019ve finally moved on from daydreaming to starting a remodel of your home. Start by gathering some basic details: know what you can actually afford, and plan to add a small reserve on top of that. The materials you want to use also factor in, as well as how much work will be done. Plus, everything that isn\u2019t visible\u2014the infrastructure\u2014will impact your costs. This can be a lot to keep track of, especially if this is your first time renovating.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, we have done some of the legwork in this guide to Chicago remodeling costs. This guide focuses on some of the major remodeling categories: <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whole house remodels<\/a>, kitchen, bath, additions\u2014as well as permits. You can use these details to create an accurate budget for a Chicago-area renovation.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Baseline home renovation costs in Chicago<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs (including labor and materials) gathered from <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractors<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full-home renovation: From <\/span><b>$105<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0per square foot (psf)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget bath remodel: <\/span><b>$16,500 <\/b>(standard full size)<\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mid-grade bath remodel: <\/span><b>$26,000\u00a0<\/b>(standard full size)<\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-end bath remodel: <\/span><b>$37,500\u00a0<\/b>(standard full size)<\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget kitchen remodel: <\/span><b>$23,500<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 (medium-sized)<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <\/span><b>$35,500 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(medium-sized)<\/span><\/b><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High-end kitchen remodel: <\/span><b>$72,000 <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(medium-sized)<\/span><\/b><\/li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basement remodel: <\/span><b>$40,000\u2014$75,000<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><b>Pro tip:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in renovating, it\u2019s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You\u2019ll also want to book a start date on the contractor\u2019s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Chicago remodeling costs per square foot<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Gut renovation vs. non-gut renovation<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gutting a home pretty much means starting from scratch. You&#8217;ll take everything down to the studs or framework, and\/or you&#8217;ll knock down walls. Because it&#8217;s more intricate, the average cost to gut and remodel a house starts at the higher end of the <\/span><b>$100 to $200<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf range. By contrast, a remodel of the space within existing walls will be at the lower end. For example, remodeling a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom condo may range from <\/span><b>$50,000 to $70,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while a gut reno likely will exceed <\/span><b>$100,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This work usually involves running new plumbing pipes and wiring, moving doorways, and possibly installing new flooring.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Full home gut renovation costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs for a full home gut renovation start at <\/span><b>$105<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0per square foot. Take note: this scope of work is extensive! Expect demo, framing, insulation and drywall, wiring, plumbing, heating\/cooling systems, millwork, paint, flooring, tile, light fixtures, electronics, and all finishes. (This excludes appliances, which can significantly increase costs, depending on how high-end they are.) According to Chicago-based<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten contractor Ryan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cA whole-house renovation\u2014say, 3,000 square feet\u2014would cost <\/span><b>$200,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at the low end, and start at <\/span><b>$400,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the high end. It all depends on the materials chosen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Wet room renovation costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wet rooms\u2014connected to a water supply, such as bathrooms or kitchens\u2014typically start at <\/span><b>$250<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf. In the city, bathrooms in condos or co-ops can be as small as 30 square feet. However, in freestanding homes, they are typically larger than 5\u2019 x 8\u2019.\u00a0 High-end renovations that are fully custom with luxury materials can cost upwards of <\/span><b>$700<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per square foot. Architectural design and drawings, demolition, construction, materials, fixtures, lighting, and finishes are included in the fee.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Build in a buffer to your budget<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contractors may build in overage fees to their estimates. This allows for the unexpected<span>\u2014<\/span>which definitely can happen<span>\u2014<\/span>to be covered. Overages are usually 10-15% of the project cost. (We recommend that the renovator reserve at least 10-15% above the bid as well). Don&#8217;t let the numbers shock you, though: the beauty of<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a general contractor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is that it&#8217;s one-stop shopping. Working with a contractor covers pretty much <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/chicago-renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all the trades required for the job<\/a>. This spares you the work of hiring individual tradesmen to complete the various aspects of your project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago-based<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6105#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten contractor Brad<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recommends being realistic about how much you can spend. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a <strong>$100,000<\/strong> ring on a <strong>$5,000<\/strong> budget. Nail down your contractor first; they know pricing. And add 15 percent for unexpected conditions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Average cost of a kitchen remodel in Chicago<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Budget kitchen renovation costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-midwest\/how-to-remodel-a-kitchen-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">process of remodeling a kitchen<\/a>, the typical starting point is <strong>$23,500<\/strong> based on a 100-square-foot space.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This translates to stock cabinets from a big-box store with space to fit <span>a refrigerator, a four-burner range, a dishwasher, and a microwave. Materials could include laminate flooring, tile under $10 \/ square foot, and fixtures by Delta and American Standard.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have found that <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/kitchen\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revamping a kitchen<\/a> measuring 100 square feet at this finish level can start at <strong>$35,500<\/strong>.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <span>Opting for mid-grade materials is a smart way to strike a balance between cost efficiency and quality. Some reputable options to consider include Diamond or Kemper cabinets, Caesarstone countertops, Daltile floors, and tiles from TileBar and Ann Sacks. For fixtures, brands like Brizo, Hansgrohe, and Kohler offer reliable choices. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>High-end kitchen costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on what we have seen, expect starting costs to be <strong>$37,500<\/strong> for a 100-square-foot room at this finish level. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expect quality and craftsmanship with top-flight <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">custom cabinets<\/a>, stone or porcelain flooring, stone or quartz countertops, and tile from brands like <span>Cle Tile and Artistic Tile.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeten contractor Ryan has seen kitchens cost <\/span><b>$50,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a gut remodel, and at the high end, closer to <\/span><b>$100,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThose figures,\u201d he says, \u201ccan vary greatly, as some cabinetry alone might cost <\/span><b>$80,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Average bathroom remodel costs in Chicago<\/h3>\r\n<h4>Budget bathroom remodel costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-midwest\/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-chicago\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prepare for a bathroom remodel<\/a>, you&#8217;ll need to settle on a realistic budget.

Whether it\u2019s a ground-level addition, a basement remodel, or a second-floor addition, accessing rough-ins for plumbing will vary and affect pricing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4>High-end primary suite addition costs<\/h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a 32&#8242; x 20&#8242; primary suite with a separate sitting area and large primary bath over a crawl space, costs are around <\/span><b>$553 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psf or <\/span><b>$359,232<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This kind of project includes custom shelving, built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Basement renovation costs in Chicago<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A starting budget for a basement is around <\/span><b>$100<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> psf. At the low end, average renovation costs are around <\/span><b>$40,000, <\/b>which<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0includes a bathroom with a shower. Flooring options can vary significantly, including laminate, vinyl, engineered wood, porcelain tile, or stained concrete. At the high end, a project for <\/span><b>$75,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may include a 5&#8242; x 8&#8242;-foot bathroom with a shower, a wet bar, and flooring in an overall space measuring 20&#8242; x 30&#8242;.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costs for a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/basement\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">basement renovation<\/a> can be affected by multiple factors. Consider the existing condition of the space, if plumbing pipes need to be installed or moved, if new water service is required and if bracing needs to be done to eliminate structural supports in the middle of a space. Also take into consideration ceiling height, since Chicago basements are typically 8 feet or less, and as low as 6\u20197\u2033. If you want to raise the ceiling, that requires digging out and underpinning the foundation. In addition, it\u2019s necessary to assure the space is waterproof. A perimeter drain tile system is installed (repaired or extended). Connecting it to a sump pump also is important to consider, and this cost can start at around <\/span><b>$2,500<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Chicago remodeling costs for permits<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The permit process for renovating varies from Chicago to its suburbs, with each of the village\u2019s or town\u2019s governing bodies determining requirements and fees. In Chicago, permits are obtained through the Building Department. The issue in common is safety and compliance with building codes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Winnetka, remodeling permits cost <\/span><b>$30<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per <\/span><b>$1,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of construction; new construction is <\/span><b>$1.30<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per square foot of new gross area. There also are permit fees for plumbing, electrical service (<\/span><b>$9,800<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for 200 amp service; <\/span><b>$21,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for 400 amp service), furnace, and AC as well as roofing and pools. In Hinsdale, the permit fee for remodeling is calculated on two percent of the value of construction.\u00a0 In addition, expect to pay permit fees for demolition (<\/span><b>$3,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Chicago, applications for building permits must include architectural drawings and names of all licensed contractors\u2014plumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors (usually supplied by the general contractor). There is no one size fits all. But expect to pay between <\/span><b>$1,500<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>$2,000<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> minimally for a whole house remodel, major kitchen, and\/or bath. The larger the project, the more the fee, ranging to as high as <\/span><b>$10,000.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also an Easy Permit Program for small projects that do not require architectural drawings (usually available the same day). There are nominal costs (a few hundred dollars for plumbing and electrical permits), which usually are pulled by those contractors.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Find expert Chicago general contractors near you<\/h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post your project<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and we\u2019ll match you with <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple vetted general contractors<\/a> to provide estimates for your renovation, then<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help you evaluate the estimates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
