In Houston, real estate comes in a variety of architectural styles, from French Country and bungalow to Queen Anne and ranch. Plus, b<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ath trends today cover a range of d\u00e9cor styles that are compatible with your home\u2019s architecture. For those considering their own small bathroom renovation in Houston, here are the need-to-knows and items to plan for before you begin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are your goals for your bathroom renovation?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For most people doing small bathroom renovations, updating the bathroom design is the #1 priority. Who doesn\u2019t welcome a glow-up, especially in the bathroom? Modernizing dated cabinetry and hardware, and installing more stylish faucets are go-to options. So is swapping out a tub for a shower. Or, upgrading the shower with a thermostatic system with integrated volume control. Maybe your luxury shower dreams include multiple body sprays and a rain shower! Many homeowners opt to remove old, tired <\/span><span class=\"s1\">for a refreshed version. Another key focus in bathroom renovations is adding extra storage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are your needs?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s easier to figure out. Who will use the bath? In a medium-sized bath, do you prefer a tub or shower? Single or double vanity? Take clear notes on any must-have features in your bath.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Budgeting for a bath remodel in Houston\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To help you sort it out, here is what you can expect to pay in Houston, on average. Retaining the footprint in a mid-range bathroom remodel in Houston starts at around $15,000, up to $25,000. Costs will vary based on the materials used, as well as the complexity of installation. For example, a mosaic backsplash is more affordable when the tiles are installed on a sheet. Micro mini tiles installed individually will be more labor-intensive\u2014and more expensive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Materials costs can vary greatly as well, with super affordable options available at big box stores, versus high-end imported tile companies. A powder room may slide into a slightly lower entry-level for costs, but again, it depends on the materials you choose! <em>Read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-houston\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home renovation costs for Houston.<\/a><\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are you likely to recoup in value?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sixty percent, according to <em>Remodeling<\/em>\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost Vs Value<\/a> report for Houston. Or, almost $12,000; based on a 5-by-7 foot bath that costs around $19,000 or $542 psf. This includes a new 30-by-60 inch porcelain-on-steel bathtub, new single-lever temperature, and pressure-balanced shower control, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How long does a Houston bathroom renovation take?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to Sweeten contractors, construction time averages about two to three weeks. However: <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">planning, executing, and finishing<\/a> can take six weeks to three months\u2014depending on the size and complexity of your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How to get the most bang for the buck<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When your space is dimensionally challenged (read: small), and you don\u2019t have the room or budget to expand, you still have plenty of options. One way is to create the illusion of more space, by doing one or more of the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Use wall-mounted vanities and toilets.\u00a0 That extra floor space opens up the room.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another space enhancer: a solid surface vanity counter with an integral sink.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Install a wall-to-wall mirror behind a long vanity or an oversized round mirrors. Mirrors visually expand space. Some streamlined designs incorporate medicine cabinets.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A classic pedestal sink also is visually slimming. Modern washstands, usually in metal frames, are on-trend options, especially white on black. More traditional sinks with turned console legs offer additional metal choices, like brass or polished nickel.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building in storage wherever you can tuck in shelves for towels and essentials. Recessed niches in the shower for shampoo and conditioner also are smart.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Swap a tub for a roomy walk-in shower with an all-glass frame. If there\u2019s a window, natural light will flow through, visually boosting the dimensions of the space.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why should you consider neutrals in the bathroom?\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many homeowners opt for white and beige in baths because it\u2019s safe. But that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be boring! Designers use a few tricks of the trade to keep neutrals feel fresh. One trick is the magic of tone-on-tone\u2014but with nuances. (That means mixing different shades of neutral, from light to dark.) Another trick is to pair neutrals with different textures.\u00a0 Get this look by pairing a dimensional wallcovering or an embossed tile with a polished or smooth surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding color to a bathroom\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We love when homeowners go bold in the bathroom and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.houstonchronicle.com\/life\/home\/design\/article\/35-ideas-to-amp-up-your-bathroom-s-style-15404821.php#photo-19670294\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">color outside the lines<\/a>. Some argue that vibrant colors can take over smaller spaces, like powder rooms. But others feel that\u2019s the perfect venue for bold cobalt or emerald, a spicy tangerine, or saffron. Precisely <em>because<\/em> it\u2019s a small space, you can afford to be dramatic\u2014and even splurge on faucets and towel holders, plus lighting and a fancy wallcovering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Color doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to walls: consider the countertop or the vanity. Blues and greens\u2014bright and pale\u2014are gaining traction in traditional, country, and modern styles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Comparing bathroom remodeling materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stone has some hefty competition these days from porcelain tile. Porcelain is not confined to small format 4-, 6- or 12-inch tiles. Porcelain comes in slabs, some very thin yet sturdy, which can be applied to walls and floors. And with digital technology, manufacturers are able to replicate some of the most desirable marbles (Carrara or Calacatta) or granites.\u00a0 The look of exotic-colored stones also is available with remarkable authenticity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Currently, matte black is a hot trend in faucets and hardware. Burnished and polished gold are also trending, and pairing them with black is especially chic. Mixing metals, like satin metal and polished nickel with gold also is more acceptable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One guideline for choosing materials that are basically semi-permanent: Being on-trend (modernizing the classics) is fine, but being trendy (here now, gone tomorrow) is not.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Be sure to allow enough time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as you have a plan, try to get through the selection process for materials as quickly as you can. Ask about inventory even before you place your order, so you\u2019re not disappointed. You may be unpleasantly surprised to find that your favorite tile or stone, or that dreamy vanity you&#8217;ve got your eye on, will take an extra 6 to 8 weeks to show up. However, i<\/span><span class=\"s1\">f you can\u2019t imagine living without it, go for it! It may be well worth the wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Demolition and prep<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On average, ripping out old bathroom material is a day\u2019s work. It depends on how large the room is, and how extensive the renovation will be. For instance, removing a tile floor or wall may take a bit longer. Tweaking plumbing and electrical, which may require rerouting or new wiring, also is part of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Installation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ve passed through the rough and dirty parts, and now you\u2019re in the fun phase. When surfaces, fixtures, and lighting get installed (allow 1 to 3 days), take a moment to enjoy it! Grab some pictures on your phone to show your family and friends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Follow the experts&#8217; lead for small bathroom renovations<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It is tempting to think that renovating a smaller area will automatically mean fewer issues to deal with.
