You can also hear more on his podcasts. <span style=\"color: #333333;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/how-do-i-grow-my-general-contracting-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here to read Part 1<\/a>.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/general-contractor-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten matches general contractors<\/a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are the most important stats for contractors when they\u2019re looking to grow their business?\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First off, don\u2019t be intimidated by the numbers\u2014it is just scorekeeping. Think of it like fantasy football stats &#8211; you need to run the plays that get the most yardage. Using data will help you make better decisions. Like fantasy football or baseball, work on your \u201cstats\u201d weekly and be objective. How many times did the phone ring? Where did your leads come from? What was the size of the job? How much did you spend to get that lead? What is the close rate of all the leads from that source, how many closed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The numbers tell you where to focus. Don\u2019t shy away from them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>Note:<\/em>\u00a0Tom discusses more about stats on <a href=\"https:\/\/thecontractorfight.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">his podcast.<\/span><\/a> You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/general-contractor-performance-stats-page\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">monitor how your business is doing<\/span><\/a> when you are part of the Sweeten network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are the top three things you encourage GCs to start doing when they join your program?<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4><span class=\"s1\">1. Engage with a like-minded community<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It may sound remedial but, first and foremost, I encourage general contractors to join our online community. The first step is to get engaged\u2014don\u2019t be a wallflower. It is like joining a gym, and then not going\u2014that won\u2019t get you any closer to your goals. Get in, ask questions, engage, be present. This is a like-minded community, so share your story and listen to the stories of others. If you follow the system, it will work for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"s1\">2. Define the first problem<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Get clarity around the very first issue you want to fix. You need to define that first problem. Focus on one issue and go all-in on that. Use the frameworks provided to double down and knock down that first domino. You have to dedicate time and energy to the problem, which means you won\u2019t be able to fix everything at once.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>3. Focus on your first problem every day<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you have defined that first domino, build consistent habits around tackling that problem, so it always stays top of mind. Then create a checklist of three things and do it every day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are the most important things to do when looking to start selling jobs with a higher profit?\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take a hard look at your numbers<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">First off, you need to give yourself a reality check (via the job-costing exercise). At least 75% of general contractors do not know or understand their own numbers. In my program, when we take them through their numbers, it is an eye-opening experience. It&#8217;s possible to sell jobs with a 50% profit. It doesn&#8217;t sound possible but it can be done.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Sharpen your communication skills<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Get your sales process in order. How you communicate with a prospective client makes a huge difference. Most contractors think it is about the scope of work or price, but it is absolutely about human connection and understanding the homeowner\u2019s motives. Practice by role-playing with the online community. Oh, and listen when people talk; don\u2019t just think about what you plan to say next!<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How to build trust with clients<\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lastly, \u201cmind the gap\u201d\u2014this is the time between the sale and the work being done.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><strong>Don\u2019t go silent:<\/strong><span class=\"s3\">\u00a0Continue to add value during this time by educating them so they feel great about their decision to hire you. This builds trust and makes it a great experience.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><strong>Do what you say you will when you promise to do it:<\/strong><span class=\"s3\">\u00a0Being trustworthy and having integrity is critical to this business and being able to charge higher prices.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><strong>Don\u2019t blame customers for being cheap: <\/strong><span class=\"s3\">Ask yourself first \u201chave I done everything I can to make sure this customer feels heard?\u201d<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><i><br \/>\n<\/i><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Thanks to Tom Reber for sharing his invaluable advice with us!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/general-contractor-network\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47491\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CTA-GrowBusiness.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CTA-GrowBusiness.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/CTA-GrowBusiness-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Check out the rest of Sweeten&#8217;s Contractor content series:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/how-is-sweeten-different-for-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How is Sweeten Different?<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/contractors\/how-to-include-profit-overhead-costs-in-renovation-project-estimates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Include Profit &amp; Overhead Costs in Renovation Project Estimates<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tom Reber, founder of The Contractor Fight, reveals why stats and client trust are important When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn\u2019t clear.
