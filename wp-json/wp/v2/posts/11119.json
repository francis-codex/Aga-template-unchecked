Living out of boxes and welcoming a newborn, it took us a few weeks to realize that we were having trouble finding space for groceries and that we had accidentally made a habit of storing kitchen basics in the basement. The move just about doubled the total space of our home, and yet we were struggling to find a place for everyday kitchen stuff.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our punch list was pretty classic: kitchen storage was sorely lacking and countertop space was a joke. We are working parents who don&#8217;t cook that often, but we were ready to move our pots and pans out of the oven. We also realized that the bar-height counter was inaccessible for our kids and wanted to create a central gathering spot with a more standard counter height.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11126 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-01.png\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-01.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-01-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11127 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-03.png\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-03.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-03-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The kitchen had been recently renovated and we liked the look, so we initially entertained the possibility of a quick fix like purchasing a kitchen island, but ended up deciding to use what we had and expand on it. At first, I tried to juggle contractor bids on my own, but with kids and jobs, that turned out to be decidedly easier said than done. I <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/1197\" target=\"_blank\">posted the project<\/a>\u00a0on <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweeten<\/a> and added to the plans to create a laundry room in the basement by enclosing our washer\/dryer with built-out walls and solid doors.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11128 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-02.png\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-02.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/Before-02-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sweeten introduced us to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/2536\" target=\"_blank\">this Sweeten contractor<\/a> (of recent <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/team\/apartment-renovation-east-village\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweeten blog fame!<\/a>) and we awarded our project to him after seeing his straightforward and realistic style. My biggest fear was that a contractor would say yes to anything to seal the deal, but he\u00a0gave us a realistic completion date and it was nice to know from the start that his team had already been screened by Sweeten.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11129 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-01.png\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-01.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-01-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11130 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-02.png\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-02.png 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/during-02-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our contractor\u00a0guided the work through multiple stages and helped us seamlessly extend our existing kitchen cabinetry with custom drawers, stained and finished to match the look we already had. When we had trouble coming up with matching backsplash tile, he managed to track it down with a local builder. We were also grateful for his willingness to work around our family&#8217;s schedule &#8211; naturally, we picked New York&#8217;s most brutal winter to live through a kitchen renovation and relied on Paul to gracefully adjust on snow days when the kids were home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After watching our contractor\u00a0put the new cabinetry pieces in place and create a dedicated laundry room, we found a few other spots for his team to add finishing touches and details including cosmetic wall patching and custom doors to replace a tired set that concealed the fuse boxes for the property.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11134 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11135 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg\" alt=\"brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are thrilled with the results and psyched that we were able to work with so much of what we already had.
