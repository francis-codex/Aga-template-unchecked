When it came time to renovate, deeper cabinets were a must. If you\u2019re planning a kitchen renovation, this homeowner shares the following advice: \u201cMeasure all your cookware and then use those measurements to design your kitchen cabinets. It made us feel a little OCD to do this, but it really paid off.\u201d Even if you plan on buying stock cabinets vs. custom-made, measuring the interiors to make sure that all of your cookware will fit is a smart move.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-30430 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"renovation advice\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Short on time? Order materials as early as possible.<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to make a tight timeline work, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/bathrooms\/a-moody-bath-for-a-getaway-home-part-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nate and Michelle<\/a> recommend that future renovators order materials as soon as possible. \u201cMake sure you have all the pieces before starting. That includes the tile, fixtures, vanities, toilets, and even the little things like towel hooks and toilet paper holders. That way, you can avoid delays while waiting for some piece to come in,\u201d Nate said. Purchasing stock items versus custom or special order will make it easier to stay on schedule. At Sweeten, we see homeowners placing orders for materials without consulting with their contractor on the timeline, which can cause major project delays, so this is sage advice.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-29713 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"renovation advice\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Prepare for paint hues to look different on your walls<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the major lessons that <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brooke<\/a> learned while renovating is that paint colors never look the way you expect them to look once they\u2019re on the walls of your home. \u201cI had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were going green in the kitchen.\u2019 So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead,\u201d Brooke said. The takeaway: if there\u2019s a tint, or a hint of another color, visible from the paint swatch, expect it to have a much bigger effect on your space when your walls are painted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-29899 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"renovation advice\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Soundproofing can be worth the expense for privacy and comfort<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soundproofing is rarely noticeable\u2014it\u2019s essentially invisible\u2014but the role it plays can have an enormous impact on your daily life. \u201cPaying more for soundproofing the bathroom (so you don\u2019t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marsha<\/a> said. \u201cWe really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we \u2018needed\u2019 those more expensive items\u2014she was right.\u201d Of course, you don\u2019t have to soundproof your bathroom, but if you can fit it into your budget, this extra step elevates the comfort of your home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28698 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"renovation advice\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Conserve funds in parts of your budget to help pay for unexpected issues<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sticking to your budget can be difficult, especially when quality is your top priority. However, doing so pays off when something unexpected happens\u2014like discovering that you need more materials than you budgeted for. When considering brands of non-toxic paint, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/original-details-brooklyn-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarah<\/a> looked at high-end options first before choosing a budget-friendly brand. The economically priced VOC-free paint turned out to be a smart decision. \u201cOur plaster walls drank up the paint and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten,\u201d said Sarah. Since she chose an affordable option from the get-go, the extra gallons of paint didn\u2019t break the budget.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/how-5-couples-renovated-together\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See how 5 couples<\/a> (and first-time renovators!) tackled remodeling their homes together.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
