A full-service design\/build general contracting firm can also offer comprehensive architectural services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After your plans are complete, you will use them to find a general contractor that meets your needs. If your project requires an architect, your <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> general contractor may also be able to refer one. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">The most successful projects will use an architect and contractor that have worked together before and complement each other\u2019s work.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p5\">Here, <span class=\"s2\">we<\/span> lay out the full details on when your project will need an architect and how much you should expect to pay. <span class=\"s1\">Our vetted contractors can help homeowners access different levels of architectural services and architects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p5\">You\u2019ll need an architect when the DOB requires signed plans<\/h3><p class=\"p5\">First, your city\/building may require you to use one. Are you are making any significant changes that require the involvement of your Department of Buildings? If so, then you&#8217;ll need an architect to make applications and pull permits. As architect Shannon Reid of <a href=\"https:\/\/rwa.nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Reid Wilson Architects<\/span><\/a> told us, \u201c<span class=\"s4\">Each jurisdiction has a clear delineation on what types of projects require a licensed professional to sign and seal the drawings. NYC is more restrictive than most, and homeowners may find an architect is required due to DOB regulations.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><h3 class=\"p8\">You\u2019ll need an architect if the remodel affects walls, electrical, and plumbing<\/h3><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s5\">\u201c<\/span>An architect is generally required when a remodel requires the removing or relocation of walls,\u201d as architect John Kim of <a href=\"http:\/\/kmystudios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Kimoy Studios<\/span><\/a> told us.<\/p><p class=\"p8\">If walls are being moved, your remodel will likely \u201caffect plumbing counts or locations,\u201d and require city, as well as co-op\/condo board approvals, as architect Steven Harper of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mndpc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">MNDPC<\/span><\/a> explained.<\/p><h3 class=\"p8\">You\u2019ll need an architect if you want a professional to manage the project<\/h3><p class=\"p8\">According to Shannon, \u201cArchitects often act as owner\u2019s representatives during the construction phase.\u201d Also, \u201c&#8230;during construction, the architect follows the project to make sure the contractor is following the drawings and the end result is what the homeowner has approved.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"p8\">All that said, \u201carchitects are essentially professional problem solvers, so any remodel or modification could benefit from the advice or services an architect can offer,\u201d said architect Steven.<\/p><h3 class=\"p10\">What services do architects offer?<\/h3><p class=\"p5\">Given the scale of these types of projects, the money spent on architectural services is worth it! One key benefit: architects will project-manage the remodel from start to finish. This is ideal for busy homeowners or those new to remodeling. Additionally, architects use their training to create an optimal and thoughtful design to suit your lifestyle. This guarantees that your new space suits your needs perfectly.<\/p><p class=\"p10\">When you hire an architect, you can opt for a full suite of services. This includes the following:<\/p><p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"hire-architect-project-graph\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31023 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg\" alt=\"when to hire an architect project graph\" width=\"1032\" height=\"552\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg 1032w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/1000-Project-Graph-5a-300x160.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/1000-Project-Graph-5a-600x321.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px\" \/><\/p><h3 class=\"p10\">How much does an architect cost?<\/h3><p class=\"p5\">That sounds great, you say! But how much will it cost? For residential remodels, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. In major urban areas like New York City, this is typically between 15-20 percent for a project costing under $100,000. Large or costly projects budgeted above $250,000 or more can sometimes be billed at a lower percentage, between 10-15 percent.<\/p><p class=\"p5\">When it comes to permit fees or application fees, they are either required fixed fees or are based on the cost of construction. <span class=\"s6\">These vary based on location but in general, once a project is under construction, additional fees might be paid to the Department of Buildings.<\/span> Expect fees if you change the plans and the application needs to be amended, or if the construction time is extended.<\/p><p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s8\">The cost of an expediter is often minimal when working with the Department of Buildings in towns outside city limits (you don\u2019t usually need one). <\/span>It\u2019s not uncommon to be able to walk into the buildings department of smaller towns and obtain the information you\u2019re looking for without an expediter.<\/p><p class=\"p5\">Some architects may charge a fixed rate, an hourly rate, or a cost per square foot. However, these fee structures are less common for full-service residential remodel projects.<\/p><h3 class=\"p10\">Can I hire an architect for standalone services?<\/h3><p class=\"p5\">If you do not plan to do a gut remodel, it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay for the full package. However, there are certain situations where you may need an architect for just one part of your project. For example, if <span class=\"s9\">your building requires schematic designs<\/span> by a registered architect (RA), for a fairly small bathroom project.<\/p><p class=\"p5\">For those who are willing to provide one-off services, you will typically work out an hourly billing arrangement. Alternately, they may <span class=\"s10\">charge a flat rate based on the time needed to complete it.\u00a0<\/span>Some architects do not charge for initial consultations. If they do, they&#8217;ll apply that cost towards the project total if you award the project to them.<\/p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s5\">Depending on their experience and seniority, a project manager&#8217;s hourly rate will range between $100 to $150. For a principal RA, expect $175 to $250. You can also request a cap on the hourly rate if you need to stay within budget. <\/span><\/p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s5\">Architect Steven told us that <\/span>they typically offer \u201cpre-design services for a modest fee (fixed cost, not hourly) that would include\u2014among other things\u2014a site visit, code review, preliminary budget and schedule estimates, and feasibility. This fee is credited against the fee for our full services if we proceed with a project. However, the deliverables can just as easily be used to engage with another firm if that is a better fit.\u201d<\/p><p>Do you need an architect for your project?
