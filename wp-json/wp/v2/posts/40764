On a purely functional level, we also wanted to make the house more comfortable by upgrading the interior insulation and making sure the electrical and plumbing were up to snuff.<\/p>\n<p>The flooring throughout the house was another element that helped tie everything together. After peeling back the old carpeting, we discovered that all of the original hardwood floors were in great shape for a house built in the 1920s, so we ended up just sanding and staining them dark walnut. Not having to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/wood-flooring-cost-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay for new flooring<\/a> saved us a ton of money.

I wanted to keep it, so the contractor protected it and framed it out without missing a beat.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Between Merri and I, there must be dozens of books in the house. Part what we wanted in making over the house was one central place to keep them. I\u2019ve always loved houses with libraries, so we designated one long wall in the dining room for the library, and bought a six-tier bookshelf to hold everything.<\/p>\n<p>The dining room is located right off of the living room and off of that is an enclosed porch, which we turned into a mudroom. To section off the two spaces, we asked for a glass door, but there was a miscommunication with the contractor and an exterior door was installed instead.\u00a0What we really wanted was a French door with multiple panes of glass from top to bottom. Our contractor quickly swapped it out for exactly what we wanted, but it was a lesson on how to be specific with requests!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-During-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40766 size-full\" title=\"kitchen during renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-During-02.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen during renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-During-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-During-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40778 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-05.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-05-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But before we got to decorating, there was some renovating to be done. Our biggest challenge was getting the kitchen exactly right. We moved a corner sink to a new spot under the large window overlooking the backyard. We didn\u2019t want to knock down walls or change the footprint of the kitchen, but we needed more storage. So we got cabinets that go all the way up to the ceiling and added a pantry, which had never been in the house before. We also added a ginormous refrigerator, a dishwasher, and we swapped out the microwave over the range for a freestanding hood. The sizes and layout of the upper and lower cabinets had to be precise to accommodate all of these additions without making the room look overstuffed.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-40780 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-07-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40781 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"hallway\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg\" alt=\"hallway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-08-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For the bathroom walls, we found 12\u201d x 24\u201d rectangular blocks of gray fabric-look tile. It\u2019s very understated but luxe and looks like suit fabric. We stayed in a hotel that used this kind of tile and managed to track down a lookalike. Everyone thinks it\u2019s wallpaper until they touch it.<\/p>\n<p>As first-time renovators, this was actually one of the biggest lessons we learned: Write your requests down! First, it helps you and whoever you may be renovating with (in this case, my sister) get on the same page. Merri and I have very different tastes and writing down what we wanted forced us to find common ground. The first day we met with our Sweeten contractor matches, we had a list ready for them to react to and this saved so much time. We were able to find out exactly how far our budget would stretch. The list also allowed our contractor to help us prioritize needs and wants. We kept revisiting it throughout the renovation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40783 mb-0 size-full\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg\" alt=\"bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-10-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Prior to this, I personally hadn\u2019t done more than paint a wall and put up shelves in my apartment, so the thought of a top to bottom house renovation was mildly terrifying. We were most worried about what was lurking behind the walls\u2014the condition of the electrical and the plumbing. The house is almost 100 years old, so you\u2019re never sure what you\u2019re going to find.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bw7gQyvamVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"reno-video-image\"  class=\"alignnone wp-image-40893 mb-0 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg\" alt=\"image of behind the reno video\" width=\"975\" height=\"193\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim.jpg 975w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/QA-MOV-Link-MargJim-600x119.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We did discover that two support beams were missing under the front entryway floor, which was why it sloped so bad.

Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn\u2019t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn\u2019t stop.<\/p>\n<p>Our Sweeten Client Services contacts were also great with checking in weekly to see if everything was proceeding as planned. Three months after we started, the renovation was completed. My favorite part was experiencing how the atmosphere of the rooms transformed; I\u2019d grown up here and everything was very clear in my mind, just the way my parents had it. The renovation actually made it feel like a completely new house. Now, it feels like a calm sanctuary. I just love how relaxed I instantly feel when I walk through the front door.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Gayle and Merri, for sharing your family home!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Style Selections black walnut wood-look floor tile, #<span class=\"met-product-item-number\">397692<\/span>;\u00a0 Allen + Roth<span class=\"met-product-item-number\">\u00a0c<\/span>abinet pulls and knobs, #<span class=\"met-product-item-number\">52356; Anatolia marble wall tile, #758465; Moden Caldwell chrome faucet, #118697;\u00a0 LG French door refrigerator,\u00a0<strong>#<\/strong><span class=\"met-product-model\">LFC24770ST; LG dishwasher, #<\/span><\/span><span class=\"met-product-model\">LDT7808ST; LG range, #<\/span>LDG4315ST: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lowes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lowe&#8217;s<\/a>.
