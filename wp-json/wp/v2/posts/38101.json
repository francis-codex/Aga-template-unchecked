One of the biggest myths about general contractors is that they want projects to go on for a long time. We&#8217;ve heard homeowners say things like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s trying to stretch out the project. He wants it to, you know, go on forever.&#8221; The truth is, general contractors want exactly the opposite. Each day they have workers on your project is another day that they have to incur labor costs. Their ideal project is one that <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starts and ends exactly on the\u00a0schedule<\/a> they laid out so they can take that crew and move them to another project. General contractors do not want your project to go on indefinitely. They want it to be done as quickly as possible\u2014just like you do\u2014and they want to do it well.<\/div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-35417\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Jean-Signature-1-723x387.jpg\" alt=\"Jean signature\" width=\"723\" height=\"387\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<p>Looking for more advice from Jean?
