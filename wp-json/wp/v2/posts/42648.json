We owned and had for years lived in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom condo in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Our 1,275-square-foot space was comfortable, but we wanted our girls to experience life as we had\u2014growing up in a family house. Instead of moving to the suburbs, we agreed that we would look at single-family fixer-uppers if it meant we could afford to move back to a favorite neighborhood, Clinton Hill, and do the unthinkable and renovate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After a year-and-a-half of searching real estate listings, we found our <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/advice-and-faq\/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">turn-of-the-century townhouse<\/a>. The square footage was less than 2,000, split among three floors, and the building had been divided into a two-family home. We didn\u2019t want to be landlords, so we would convert the space back to its original single-family state.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42921 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"family portrait, dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-portrait.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-portrait-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Finding the right townhouse to call home<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We started by looking at lots of New York City townhome photos on Pinterest, and thinking about how we could replicate the layouts of those we liked. We didn\u2019t want the space to feel choppy, like it was still two apartments. We wanted to reconfigure our first floor, which had been a one-bedroom apartment, as an open-concept living room, dining area, and kitchen. Our contractor was also a design-build firm that would help with the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">entire design transition and execution<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42894 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-Jill-Home-Before-FirstFloor-15.jpg\" alt=\"Dining area before\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-Jill-Home-Before-FirstFloor-15.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-Jill-Home-Before-FirstFloor-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/SWEETEN-Jill-Home-Before-FirstFloor-15-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42917 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-2.jpg\" alt=\"dining area after, window seat \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-2-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>A townhouse remodel allows for a bigger first-floor<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We realized we could create the flow of a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/lp\/entire-home\/renovations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">single-family townhouse<\/a> by widening the first-floor apartment\u2019s entryway and leaving it open to the hall and stairway. The rooms on this floor would be joined to create our large living and dining space. We needed more space for the kitchen, and found square footage by bumping into the ground-floor bath, removing the bathtub and turning it into a powder room.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42918 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-3.jpg\" alt=\"Ceiling-height kitchen cabinets, green backsplash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-3-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42920 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-5.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen spice storage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-kitchen-5-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Find a modern mid-century aesthetic<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Like in most townhouses, the rooms lacked natural light. We brought sunlight into the now combined living and dining room by adding sliding glass doors leading from the kitchen to the house\u2019s backyard. We also installed new black-framed windows throughout, which updated the house\u2019s facade.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;In the end, we exceeded our budget, but we feel like all of the stress and uncertainty was worth the final product and long term investment.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When we bought the home, it had been stripped of original details, but during work on the new living room we uncovered the brick fireplace, which had been hidden behind a closet. We had it pointed and we are so pleased that we managed to preserve this one striking original detail of our home. We ordered the black iron fireplace cover from a restoration company. It was made the same year as the house in 1899.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-living-room-3.jpg\" alt=\"Fireplace renovation, living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-living-room-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42915 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-hallway.jpg\" alt=\"Floor-to-ceiling hallway window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-hallway.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-hallway-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-hallway-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Inside the kitchen, we focused on clean lines and chose materials that fit a mid-century modern aesthetic, which I love. The subway tile, walnut flat-panel cabinetry, and light fixtures all come together for a great retro-modern look. The cutout window seat is a super coffee-drinking spot. I tried to maintain that mid-century aesthetic throughout the home with neutral paint colors, natural woods, and lighting and furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42910 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"Moroccan floor tile, bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42911 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg\" alt=\"walk-in glass shower, bathroom, floating vanity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-blue-tile-bathroom-2-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42926 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hex tile, bathroom, floating vanity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1496\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bathroom-1-201x300.jpg 201w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bathroom-1-600x898.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Converting the upper-level apartment<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The upper floors came next. The other apartment, a second and third-floor duplex, had a large kitchen on the home\u2019s center floor. We\u2019d decided to convert it to a master bedroom and remodel the second-floor bathroom as a master bath. The addition of a floor-to-ceiling window at the end of the second-floor hallway, overlooking the backyard, brings in light where it used to be horrendously dark. The third floor had two separate, large bedrooms for the girls, but no bathroom. We turned one of only two storage closets in the entire home into the girls\u2019 bathroom. This is one place, along with the first-floor bathroom, where we deviated from the mid-century aesthetic, choosing Moroccan tile for a flash of pattern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The hidden condition of the staircase shocked us. We planned to have the stairs leading from the first floor refinished with new treads, but our Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/ny\/brooklyn-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contractor in Brooklyn<\/a> discovered that the 120-year-old wooden staircase was rotten. The construction team built us an entirely new staircase. The contractors gave us peace of mind that the house is stronger and safer now than it was before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42928 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bedroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bedroom, closet, hardwood flooring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bedroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bedroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-master-bedroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-42929 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-staircase.jpg\" alt=\"renovated staircase\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-staircase.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-staircase-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-staircase-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Jill-staircase-585x878.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The stress and cost were worth renovating their townhome<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The biggest challenge we faced was living in the home through most of the renovation. It was at times stressful, but I was fascinated, watching each stage unfold.\u00a0Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractors and Sweeten were of great help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ll say this: If you are renovating a 100-plus-year-old home, expect a substantial <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">portion of your budget<\/a> to go towards system upgrades like electrical, plumbing, heating, and the sewer line. After those things, plan on replacing a lot of worn-out materials\u2014the roof, the stucco, and the windows, for starters. For an older home renovation, you\u2019ve got to budget a much larger contingency. Our job went way over budget, partly because so many things needed to be replaced or upgraded.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the end, we exceeded our budget, but we feel like all of the stress and uncertainty were worth the final product and long-term investment.
