If you are creative like Dianna, an advertising agency director, and Todd, a college professor, you create a small office. The couple lives in a 440-square-foot studio alcove apartment, so space efficiency is critical. The office space is made possible by using a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corner table that fits perfectly on the landing<\/a> and floating shelves for storage and aesthetic interest.<\/p>\n<h3>Multipurpose rooms combine work and play<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t justify allocating a whole room to an office.
