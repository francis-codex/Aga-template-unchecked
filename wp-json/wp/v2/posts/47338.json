Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time<\/span><span class=\"s5\"> to make this home more liveable for our family.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">We <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/32505\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posted our project<\/a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/truth-design-build-firms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a design-build firm<\/a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight\u2014we were looking to renovate during our kids\u2019 summer break and move back in before school resumed\u2014and when we weren\u2019t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who\u2019d worked in our co-ops. That sold us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif\" alt=\"toe kick storage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I\u2019m in the kitchen cooking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I\u2019d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/unique-features-for-home-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome<\/a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Previously, our daughters\u2019 shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren\u2019t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">installed a sound-blocking pocket door<\/a> for the girls\u2019 room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we\u2019ll wake them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I\u2019ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">be afraid to ask for what I wanted<\/a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms\u2014we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we\u2019ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you for sharing your amazing (and kid-friendly) apartment renovation story, Samantha and Jameson!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">Renovation materials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES: Terrazzo Renata floor tiles in Brulle; Context 2&#215;6 Matte White backsplash: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annsacks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ann Sacks<\/a>.
