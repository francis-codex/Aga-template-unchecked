So when it came time for her mom, Tatiana, to find, gut, and renovate an apartment, the two teamed up to take on the condo renovation in Westchester. Tatiana was both downsizing and moving from Port Washington, in Long Island, to be closer to her grandchildren. She concentrated her search in southern Westchester, about 30 minutes outside New York City. Alissa and her family live in Bedford, NY, so that location would provide easy access.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The mother-daughter duo prioritized location and a great building with amenities, and also looked specifically for a rundown space so that they could do a full gut condo renovation. Tatiana also wanted a condo rather than a co-op; in case she ever wanted to rent out the property in the future, she didn\u2019t want to deal with strict building rules and sublet policies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The apartment they settled on was a one-bed, one-bath condo measuring 975 square feet, located in Hartsdale, NY, in a condo complex with a pool, clubhouse, and gym. The apartment itself was outdated and the kitchen and bath were original to the\u00a0building when it went up in the late &#8217;70s. Alissa\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/24376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turned to Sweeten<\/a> and the pair chose to go with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4372\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this Sweeten contractor<\/a>. Her mom closed on the unit and began the condo renovation in Westchester just a week later. Everything had to go\u2014the floors and carpets, popcorn ceilings, walls, doors, and the entire bath and kitchen.<\/p>\n<h3>Handling and ordering materials<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alissa and Tatiana decided that they would <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">order all of the materials themselves<\/a>, so they could search for good values and have full control over the final look. Alissa explained, \u201cWe knew exactly the vision we wanted for the spaces. Working in fashion and living in NYC my whole life, I was able to go direct to the wholesale districts and find the best deals on items like the fixtures and other materials. This gave us leftover money to splurge on designer furniture and lighting!\u201d The contractor took care of the demo, installation,\u00a0and provided rough construction materials.<\/p>\n<h3>Merging construction and style<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy mom is very stylish and vibrant; we wanted to create a bright, airy contemporary space to match her style,&#8221; said Alissa. &#8220;We went for neutral gray tones with splashes of color.\u201d In the living room, they chose a calming gray for the walls and floor-to-ceiling curtains, accessorizing with gold-toned finishes and brass furniture. A leather couch offers a grounding contrast to the animal print rug\u2014both on-trend and grandchild-friendly. Dark gray wood flooring and Jonathan Adler lighting are seen throughout the apartment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a more affordable solution, the contractor covered the popcorn ceiling with a one-quarter-inch layer of sheetrock rather than <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smoothing out the texture<\/a>, which would have been time-consuming and costly.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Kid-friendly materials<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatiana wanted her apartment to be \u201cdressed\u201d in a way that resembled her personal style: classic with a flair. In the kitchen, this meant going with a clean, bright white. Shaker cabinet fronts with nickel hardware were\u00a0selected for their\u00a0simplicity and mixed with open shelving as well as glass fronts. Stainless steel appliances complete the look. White and gray porcelain tile on the floor mimicked the look of marble without the price tag.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the dining area,\u00a0the mother-daughter duo was thrilled to find leather chairs in a bold cobalt blue at a Lillian August SONO outlet in Connecticut. Durable and wipeable, they\u00a0are perfect for visiting grandchildren and sit around a dining table under a silver drum pendant light.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They painted Tatiana\u2019s bedroom in warm ivory tones, with blush pink velvet curtains and a comfortable armchair. The colors are calming, and the high-gloss sheen they chose for the paint \u201cgives the walls a very lush feel and works really well with all the velvet,\u201d said Alissa.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-34252 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"open-glass-panel-door-in-foyer\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-21.gif\" alt=\"open glass panel door in the foyer opening to a white room after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The serene bathroom is in a similar color palette to the kitchen. The marble tile floors and walls complement a white vanity that has plenty of drawer space. Alissa and Tatiana accessorized the space with woven covered baskets for storage and to add a bit of warmth. They also reglazed the original bathtub and added a glass shower divider to remove the need for a shower curtain.<\/p>\n<h3>Alissa&#8217;s renovation tip: Measure your appliances\u2014and then measure again!<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Alissa shared with us a hiccup in the process: \u201cFunny story\u2014this was such an amateur move! Before the renovation started, we were online looking at kitchen appliances, got overly excited, and bought a refrigerator without taking the measurements first. My mom picked out the BIGGEST double refrigerator, thinking it would fit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the appliances were delivered, the refrigerator did not fit through the front door! It was so annoying\u2014the store had to take it back, and then we had to take very careful measurements and select another style to satisfy the space. After that incident, we measured and re-measured before making a purchase!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite that obstacle, the Sweeten contractor met the deadlines and even delivered the apartment a few days early. Since the project&#8217;s completion, Tatiana reports that \u201cthe new space is amazing, and I never want to leave!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you for sharing your Westchester condo renovation with us, Tatiana!<\/em><\/p>\n<h5>Shopping Guide<\/h5>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: 12&#8243; x 12&#8243; Porto Venato matte floor tile and 3&#8243; x 6&#8243; Metro white gloss subway tile backsplash:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.westchesterhouseandhome.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Westchester House &amp; Home<\/a>.\u00a0Sink and faucet: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wayfair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wayfair<\/a>.\u00a0Samsung refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, and microwave:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajmadison.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AJ Madison<\/a>.
