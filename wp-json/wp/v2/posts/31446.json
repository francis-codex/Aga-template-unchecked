This originally aired March 12, 2018.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:00<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">All this week we&#8217;re going to share some inspiring stories of accomplished women we admire, who dream big. We&#8217;re hoping it might inspire some of you out there, might have a good idea. First up today, a CEO who went from barely scraping by to crushing it. Jean Brownhill builds a home renovation referral company from the ground up in her own backyard and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:21<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Here we are.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:22<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Wow.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:23<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Sweeten is like home sweet home. That feeling of having a space in the world that we feel comfortable, safe and it&#8217;s home.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:33<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In a big picture sense, your business is helping people make their homes a little sweeter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:38<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yeah, exactly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:39<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Jean Brownhill is the founder and CEO of Sweeten, a company that matches homeowners with contractors for their renovation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:47<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">A lot of people look around their space they live in. They think I would like it to look better, but they&#8217;re totally overwhelmed by the process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:55<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s2\">00<\/span><span class=\"s1\">:55<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Is that where you come in?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">00:56<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Exactly. We have done thousands of renovations at this point.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:01<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In 2007, Jean, a trained architect, began renovations on her own first home. You probably thought, I&#8217;m made for this. I&#8217;m an architect.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:10<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yes. I was like this&#8230;I got this. Well, come to find out I didn&#8217;t. I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:16<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even you did that?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:17<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even I did it. I just thought, there&#8217;s got to be a better way and I have an idea how to do it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:23<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">When the light bulb went off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:24<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">It was a classic entrepreneurial moment where I was like&#8230;I know how to solve this.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:30<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">On Sweeten&#8217;s website, homeowners complete a form about their renovation. They&#8217;re matched with three contractors. They can choose who is right for their renovation project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:40<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We then follow your project from that starting point all the way to completion. We make sure that our guys are doing a great job. You get to actually give them a rating. The great thing about it is we can do it all for free for the homeowner. The general contractors pay us a small fee.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">01:57<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Some people call you &#8220;The Contractor Whisperer.&#8221; What does that mean, the contractor whisperer?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">02:02<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I love that name. I am an unlikely champion for general contractors. Let&#8217;s be honest, I&#8217;m naturally inclined to want to defend people who have been painted with a negative and broad brushstroke, and general contractors have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">02:19<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Jean grew up in New London, Connecticut. From the earliest age learns that no job is too small.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">02:25<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I was that kid who, was scooping ice cream, delivering newspapers. I had babysitting jobs. I always loved to draw, I loved to build stuff. My guidance counselor said, &#8220;Oh, you should be an architect.&#8221; I have no idea what that meant. No one in my family had ever used an architect.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">02:41<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Her determination and drive come from her family.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">02:44<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">My dad&#8217;s mom, grew up in the South, African-American woman who was a domestic worker. Who could never have the time or the luxury to have any education. She couldn&#8217;t read or write. Her whole life I watched sign her name with an X. Every moment where I feel like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m tired, this is like too much.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, come on.&#8221; You&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re putting the bathroom back here&#8230;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:09<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Jean&#8217;s hard work has paid off. Sweeten currently has $900 million in construction projects. What&#8217;s your advice to people who have an idea or dream of owning their own business or have that entrepreneurial moment? What would you tell them?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:25<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">I have two pieces of advice. Don&#8217;t quit and keep smiling. I&#8217;m a person who believes, &#8220;The more that you feel blessed, the more blessings you get.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:35<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">What do you think makes a good boss?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Jean Brownhill:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:37<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">One of the things I&#8217;ve definitely learned the most out of this whole experience is that, you can only be yourself. I can just be the best that I can be. I&#8217;m just encouraging people to be the best them. That&#8217;s the best thing that I can do as a boss is encourage people to do that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:57<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Pretty cool, right?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Al Roker:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:58<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She&#8217;s so smart.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hoda Kotb:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">03:<\/span><span class=\"s1\">5<\/span><span class=\"s1\">9<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She found a need&#8230;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">04:01<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hoda Kotb:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">04:<\/span><span class=\"s1\">0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">2<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&#8230;She filled it, that was genius.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Savannah Guthrie:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">04:03<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">She did it, she was really perfectly suited to do it and it&#8217;s taken time. At first, she kept her job. She, at night would work on her business. Then it got to the point where she could do it full-time. Sweeten is now available in New York and Philadelphia, but has plans to expand to eight more cities by 2020.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hoda Kotb:<\/strong> (<span class=\"s1\">04:19<\/span>)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Good for her.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten founder and CEO weighs in on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/sweeten-brownstone-renovation-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">what to know before renovating a brownstone<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
