Every wall is a sandwich of different materials. Those materials\u2014drywall, tape, and mud\u2014are there to help insulate your home and keep you warm and dry. When it comes to the interior finish, you\u2019ll want it to look as smooth as possible, and that\u2019s really hard when, from certain angles, you can see where all of those materials come together. Skim coating takes the same mud that is used in the construction of the walls and spreads it across the surface\u2014almost like a layer of frosting\u2014before smoothing it by hand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you need skim coating? No. Is it amazing when it\u2019s done really well? Yes, because your walls look perfect under any kind of lighting. Why is it so expensive? Because someone has to go on a ladder with a flashlight and hand-sand the walls to make sure they\u2019re perfectly smooth. That takes a while because it\u2019s a vertical surface. It\u2019s certainly your choice, but it definitely looks beautiful when it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hNBMok2FfIo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Listen to Jean answer the question<\/a>,<\/h3>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">What is Skim Coating?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Thinking of\u00a0freshening up\u00a0your walls?
