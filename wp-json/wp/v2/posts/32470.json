We had talked about it for years, and finally just grew too tired of trying to hold the existing kitchen and powder room together as parts kept failing or wearing out. Really, the kitchen was on Tracey\u2019s list from the time we first made an offer on the house. The property is a 2,300-square-foot\u00a0home constructed in 1920. It\u2019s not very typical of any identifiable style, but if a realtor were listing it, they\u2019d probably misidentify it as a Colonial.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The flow of the ground floor of our house was a mix of the original \u201820s layout and alterations made in the last 20 to 30 years. Circulation was difficult and space-consuming. Also, the prior kitchen alterations were done with materials that had now outlived their reasonable life cycle. It had always wanted to be re-done and now it finally would be.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding a general contractor for their renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/22786\">posted our project<\/a> to Sweeten, we didn\u2019t have a clear vision of a specific look or style\u2014at least not a consensus. The focus was to simplify and yield more functional space. It was also important to create a\u00a0working side of the eat-in area of the kitchen with storage and a pantry. We planned to keep the appliances but wanted new countertops, cabinets, floors, and backsplash. In an effort to improve flow, we also knocked down walls in a coat closet area\u00a0and moved the powder room. Lastly, we planned to close up an exterior door that was never used. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We chose this Sweeten contractor<\/a> for the job with me doing the\u00a0planning and sourcing of most of the materials, while Tracey handled most of the day-to-day communications with the contractor.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>A rocky (but successful) start to the renovation<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The demolition was scheduled to begin on the first day of our summer vacation. We thought that the Village was going to permit that based on materials that had already been provided to them. We heard from our contractor that he needed signed-and-sealed drawings even to begin demolition. I served as the architect on our project and happened to be in Virginia Beach at the time. I really should have known better. Luckily, being the son of a fireman and a one-time Boy Scout, I\u2019m always prepared for an architectural emergency. What architect worth his eyeglasses goes on vacation without his seal (and, yes, stamp pad) and an external drive with his current projects? After all, nowadays, you can architect from anywhere with an iPhone, Google Maps, and Kinko\u2019s\/FedEx.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32491 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"gray-patterned-floor-tiles-blue-kitchen-cabinets\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"gray patterned floor tiles in a kitchen with blue kitchen cabinets and silver appliances after renovation \" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" data-wp-editing=\"1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16-723x1085.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16-600x900.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen16.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Planning the kitchen color<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blue is Tracey\u2019s favorite color. We went through the Benjamin Moore fan deck looking for blues and expected to do a custom color. It turned out that Omega\u2019s blue stock color for the cabinets was very close to a paint color swatch that we had chosen. We were very pleased to be able to save extra time and money. Originally, Tracey said she was thinking white upper cabinets and blue lower cabinets with wood floors, but I wanted something more uniform. In the end, we chose blue cabinets for both the upper and lower cabinets, but with a white interior and glass fronts, so we each got a little of what we wanted.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the story behind the kitchen floor tile?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We were most excited about getting rid of the ceramic tile floor. It really was evil. Every time we cleaned it, it got dirtier. We tried an exorcist but, apparently, they don\u2019t do floors. It certainly didn\u2019t help that it was more of a painted clay tile than a glazed ceramic tile. Underneath the thin beige-y surface coat was a red clay body, and the finished surface didn\u2019t have anywhere near the tensile strength to overcome the flex in the floor that had been caused by some crude cuts made in the joists below in a prior alteration. Not only was the surface always dirty, but there were always red clay particles roaming around the floor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I had fallen in love with a Porcelanosa tile pattern in blue shades. Tracey said she was surprised\u00a0as it was completely outside the box of what she expected me to pick. She loved it\u2014and now loves it even more because it doesn&#8217;t show any dirt, she says. We both love the new sink base with deep drawers, in lieu of cabinet doors. No more bending and fishing through the growing variety of cleaning supplies hiding deep in the back of the cabinet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/kitchen-pantry-5-ways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pantry<\/a> is Tracey\u2019s favorite part of the renovation. Hands down. She\u2019s so proud of it, she keeps the door open all the time. And I close it every time I go by.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/wallpaper-for-bathrooms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">powder room<\/a>, we went with a pocket door as a space-saving solution. We chose simple grey flooring, a compact modern sink, and a single hanging pendant. My favorite part of the renovation is the simplicity of the powder room with the glazed door, and the large window in it. Its remote location provides all the privacy it needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Surviving the renovation process<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Importantly, Sweeten helped us find the right contractor, especially by knowing when to suggest, \u201cMaybe if you increase your <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">budget<\/a> a bit\u2026.\u201d The recurring calls by account managers to monitor progress were welcome evidence that Sweeten maintained an interest in the project being delivered successfully. Our Sweeten contractor did just what he needed to do and treated the project as a business venture, whereas we behaved as if it was our home and we wanted it to be just right. He always knew when to suggest a solution to coax a decision, and retained a remarkably even temper throughout, even when we probably didn\u2019t deserve it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of advice to future renovators: decide EVERYTHING before you start. Trust me, there will be things you never even dreamed of, so the last thing you need is an outstanding to-do list when tradesmen are in your house, swinging tools, asking you new questions every day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We feel our renovation was an even more dramatic change than we had expected. The whole flow of the house is better. Believe it or not, we\u00a0see our teenagers more because the kitchen is now a pleasant, comfortable place where they sometimes linger for a few minutes before retreating back to their rooms. The only way I could be happier with it was if it was free!<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you,\u00a0Tracey and Brian, for sharing your\u00a0long-awaited renovation with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>WESTCHESTER KITCHEN AND BATH RENOVATION: SHOPPING GUIDE<\/h4>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES:\u00a0Roche Acero <a href=\"https:\/\/www.porcelanosa-usa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floor tile<\/a>; Antique Acero <a href=\"https:\/\/www.porcelanosa-usa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stenciled floor tile<\/a>: Porcelanosa.
