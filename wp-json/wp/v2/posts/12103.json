For example, a basement remodel that is contractually expected to be finished by Christmas for visiting relatives, must be done by the specified date. Yet, it is not uncommon for homeowners to wonder why the project isn\u2019t following the schedule or if the job will finish on time. <strong>How can homeowners (or contractors) keep a project on schedule, while also saving money during remodeling?\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten <\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">highlights one part of the process that both parties have relative control over to help keep the project on schedule. The<strong> logistics of ordering materials,<\/strong> including <strong>selection<\/strong>, <strong>payment<\/strong>, and <strong>delivery<\/strong>, is one area that both homeowners and contractors agree upon as being vital to that common goal. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mythbuster: Contractors want a project to go on and on<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing that might surprise homeowners starting a project is that the contractor is equally or even <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/qa-with-jean-general-contractor-myths\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more anxious to keep the project on track<\/a>. This is because a smoothly running project means that the contractor can keep the client happy and within budget. Plus, this allows the contractor to successfully manage concurrent projects or move onto the next project on time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Who does the ordering: contractor or homeowner?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before anything else happens, draw up a contract which both the homeowner and the contractor can sign. With this contract in place, a creative union with a common mission can begin: completing the project outlined in the contract.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The logistics of ordering materials and their delivery is one factor that the homeowner can easily control in either direction to suit their style better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When should the contractor order materials?<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Generally, the contractor handles most of the supply chain of materials in a home improvement project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First, the contractor will order the materials specified for the project. Materials are typically paid out of an initial deposit made by the homeowner and by scheduled progress payments or draws.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The contractor rarely orders all materials at the same time. In fact, it makes more sense to stagger orders according to when they will be installed in the home. This also benefits the homeowner, because materials are paid for on a rolling basis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The contractor or a representative takes delivery of the items and holds them either at an off-site storage location or on the building site. When it&#8217;s time to install the item, the contractor\u2019s crew will shift the item to the building site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the contractor is not the only person responsible for managing the selection of building materials. Except for raw building materials like drywall and two-by-four studs, other materials are the homeowner\u2019s choice. The contractor and the homeowner will sit down together and select materials that match the homeowner\u2019s taste and budget and satisfy the project specifications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When should the homeowner order materials?\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Occasionally, the homeowner and contractor arrange for the homeowner to order materials. Once the homeowner consults with the contractor, the homeowner then controls all aspects of this supply chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The homeowner chooses the materials, pays for them directly, accepts delivery, inspects the items, and stores them. If any items are damaged or incorrect, it is the responsibility of the homeowner to arrange for replacement or refund.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The secret: handling logistics and specs issues<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Contractors understand why homeowners want to be on top of the managing of their own materials\u2014it&#8217;s their dream space. H<span class=\"s1\">owever, a mix weighted on the side of the contractor handling most logistics often works best.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Reasons why homeowners may want contractors to handle the logistics:\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners often focus on showpiece items such as <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frameless shower enclosures<\/a>, natural imported stone, and one-of-a-kind sinks or cabinets. These pieces often require special parts or unique installation packages.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Homeowners who order their own items often lose sight of the bigger picture. By focusing on particular items, they may lose sight of how the components fit within the project as a whole. Spacing is crucial, with components fitting within code-required spatial areas.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Delivery acceptance can be a hang-up for many homeowners, both due to size and quantity of materials. Large slabs of granite, countertops, assembled cabinets, doors, and bathtubs are often delivered curbside. Plans must then be made to immediately move these items to a secure location. Large-quantity items, such as the numerous boxes of flooring that arrive on pallets, are equally important. These, too, must be moved to a dry, secure area.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Delivery timing can be difficult for busy homeowners to manage. While small items might arrive on a no-signature basis, most home-related items require that a person accept delivery and sign for it. For instance, when taking delivery of countertop materials or windows, you don\u2019t want your neighbor signing off on it. A qualified person must inspect and sign for these items. With tailgate delivery items, you typically have the opportunity to view the item before it is off-loaded. This is also not something you want your neighbor to do!<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a homeowner who happens to be available to take delivery of materials, should you be doing this? Most homeowners do not know how to properly check for order amounts, damage, and missing pieces. Many fixtures come with very specific pieces and parts. For some items, if a tiny screw is missing from a particular piece, installation can be help up for days or weeks while the exact piece is reported, matched, and shipped.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pros of letting professionals handle the logistics:<\/span><\/h4>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Pros:<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Orders delivered on time<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Correct lead line<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Specifications controlled by the contractor<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">All parts correctly ordered<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Delivery acceptance and storage<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractor expertise with materials<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trade discounts possible<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">How to save time and money while remodeling\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">According to many contractors and veteran homeowner-remodelers, the easiest way to save time and money while remodeling is to master the logistics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To do this, you must ensure that you purchase the correct items on time, in the right order. Materials purchased too early may sit in storage for too long, or might be unreturnable later on if they cannot be used.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even worse, materials bought too late slow down the project or bring it to a complete stop. When the project stops, the subcontractors go off to other projects. The contractor may direct his or her attention to other clients. Completed work, particularly exterior work, may become damaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">How the homeowner can be involved:<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is your home, your renovation project. You want to help manage the project, especially in the area of materials ordering and logistics (and certainly if it&#8217;ll help you to save money while remodeling!) What\u2019s the best way to do this?\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Communicate with each other<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Establish a healthy flow of communication and information between you and your contractor. Phone, e-mail, video chat, and text each other on a regular basis over logistics matters; this is a best practice to follow which sets the tone for the renovation as it progresses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Establish clear responsibilities<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Establish an agreement between the two of you as to who is responsible for which part of the logistics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Aim for completion<\/b><\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conclude with a complete list of responsibilities. Be sure to spell out every aspect in writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These options are open for you and your contractor to discuss. Take stock of how much you want to personally be involved in the logistics and what feels right to reach your dream space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
