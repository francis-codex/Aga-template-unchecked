This means materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. Both<span>\u00a0<\/span>Sweeten contractor Joel<span>\u00a0<\/span>and<span>\u00a0<\/span>Sweeten contractor Kyle, both based in Dallas,\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">have worked on renovations that came under this budget range. These scenarios, however, are dependant on the scope of work and existing conditions.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once to get you the best bang for your buck. You\u2019ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>As a guide, Joel advises clients to tie the price of your kitchen (or bathroom) renovation to the price of your home. You should only spend between 10 and 20 percent of the value \u201cto really cap the budget at the return on investment,\u201d Joel said. So for a\u00a0<strong>$300,000<\/strong>\u00a0home, aim to spend between\u00a0<strong>$30,000<\/strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>$60,000<\/strong>\u00a0on a bathroom or kitchen remodel, which will be a major slice of a gut renovation project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>Before getting started, Kyle suggests homeowners should research other recent remodels in the area to see what materials and appliances were used. This is important if you want to resell quickly so you don\u2019t end up with a low-end renovation in a high-end area or vice versus. If this is your forever home, then your personal taste is more important than whoever you might sell to years later. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s10_overlay-text\"><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"s10-has-overlay alignnone wp-image-46400 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/CTA-FindGCs.png\" alt=\"find general contractors\" width=\"490\" height=\"39\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" data-overlay-text-loaded=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Dallas kitchen remodel costs per square foot in 2020<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s5\">A Dallas kitchen renovation i<span>n the best-value range can start at\u00a0<strong>$10,000<\/strong>\u00a0and reach\u00a0<strong>$15,000<\/strong>. A kitchen renovation in the best-value range can start at\u00a0<strong>$15,000<\/strong>, according to Kyle. To get a new kitchen at this price, it needs to be a rip-and-replace job, meaning a layout of the kitchen must stay the same with pipes and appliances remaining where they are. Cabinets are the highest ticket item in a kitchen budget, said Joel. To keep costs down cabinets can be re-stained or re-painted. The next step up is pre-fab followed by semi-custom. Fully custom costs the most, he said.<\/span><br \/><\/span><span class=\"s5\"><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li5\"><span><span class=\"s5\">A mid-range kitchen remodel in Dallas has costs starting at\u00a0<strong>$25,000 \u2013 $30,000<\/strong>. What does a mid-range kitchen look like at this starting cost? T<span class=\"s1\">he kitchen layout must remain the same as a rip-and-replace: swap your old oven for your new one and your old sink for your new sink.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">You can get a stainless steel sink with single-lever faucet, laminate countertops, a built-in microwave, new appliances, custom lighting, and semi-custom cabinets. An island could also be added. Moving plumbing, gas, and electrical, reconfiguring the layout, or choosing custom features will increase the budget.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li5\"><span>For an upscale kitchen, labor costs and a refresh with select high-end materials such as marble or quartz countertops, imported backsplash tile, and high-quality fixtures start at\u00a0<strong>$40,000<\/strong>.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span>The upscale kitchens Kyle has worked on were budgeted from\u00a0<strong>$50,000<\/strong> and up. A big chunk of those budgets were for custom-made cabinets, as well as quartz countertops and expensive backsplashes. \u201cAdding French doors or moving walls to create a larger kitchen\u2026\u201d also brings up the price, Kyle said. As will above and below cabinet lighting, moving plumbing, and custom-built islands, he said.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>There are plenty of variables in most materials, Joel said. For example, with quartz, you can spend <strong>$2,000<\/strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>$7,000<\/strong>\u00a0depending upon the quality. \u201cIt just comes down to not overbuilding for your house,\u201d Sweeten contractor Joel advised.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h5><span class=\"s10_overlay-text\"><\/span><\/h5>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much a Dallas bathroom remodel costs per square foot in 2020<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the low-end, expect a rip-and-replace bathroom with no behind-the-wall surprises to start at<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$8,000 \u2013 $15,000<\/strong>.<\/span>\u00a0These are typically smaller master baths or guest bathrooms. The layout will remain the same where plumbing doesn\u2019t move, Kyle said. This budget won\u2019t include any issues like leaks or mold discovered once the project begins. Materials will include a prefabricated vanity, ceramic tile, and fixtures from big-box stores.<\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the Dallas area, a mid-range bathroom can start at<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$15,000 \u2013 $25,000<\/strong>. The average cost for this price range remodel is about<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$20,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>or<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$570<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>psf, as per<span>\u00a0<\/span><em>Remodeling<\/em>\u2018s Cost Vs Value<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/west-south-central\/dallas-tx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report<\/a>. The key to a budget in this range is rip-and-replace. This means keeping the layout the same and swapping out an old toilet for a new one, an old vanity for a new one, etc. That way, no expensive plumbing work is needed.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The example project for this budget is a 35-square-foot bathroom. You can install a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.

The cost increases with features including a double vanity, creating a separate shower from the tub, specialty tile, a custom vanity, or a toilet with additional functions.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCost drivers are things like removing an existing tub or shower to install a new standalone tub,\u201d said Sweeten contractor Kyle. It can also include building larger showers, moving walls to expand bathroom size, custom vanities, and frameless glass shower enclosure.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2020 costs for outdoors &amp; deck remodeling in Dallas\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dallas is a city perfect for outdoor entertaining, whether it\u2019s a crisp winter night in front of the fire pit or a cold beer paired with a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-south\/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hot summer evening<\/a>. An outdoor area is often the cherry on top of a dream home remodel. It\u2019s the project to really let your creative juices flow. There are endless options to make your outdoor area your own with extensive outdoor kitchens, gas fireplaces, fans and misting systems for cooling, custom lighting, and landscaping.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A basic wooden deck will likely cost<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$40<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>psf or<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$13,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>for something in the 320 square foot range, according to the Cost Vs Value<span>\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s6\">report<\/span>. A deck made from composite, a mix of wood product and plastic, will cost just under<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$19,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>for the same size or<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$60<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>psf. This material tends to last longer and requires less maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2020 Remodeling costs in Dallas: Permits<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dallas is experiencing a lot of new building construction. This has resulted in a more rigorous approval process compared to approvals for existing homes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are numerous cities and towns that make up Dallas. Each one has its own building department and its own fee structure for permits. Your Sweeten contractor will likely put an estimate in the budget for building permits, which will be determined by your end costs or square footage of your project.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The upmarket suburb of Highland Park bases building permit costs on square footage.\u00a0The permit for a 200 square foot kitchen renovation costs<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$490<\/strong>, according to Highland Park\u2019s calculator.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the city of Addison,<a href=\"https:\/\/addisontexas.net\/sites\/default\/files\/fileattachments\/development_services\/page\/10881\/fee_schedule_for_bldg_permits.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s6\"><span>\u00a0<\/span>building permit fees<\/span><\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>start at<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$40<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>for projects under<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$500<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>in value. Fees then increase with the project\u2019s budget. For example, a project with a budget between<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$2,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>and<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$25,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>will have a base cost of<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$115<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>with an additional<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$23<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>per<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$1,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>for estimated costs over<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$2,000<\/strong>. That means the permit for a<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$20,000<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>mid-range bathroom remodel will cost<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$529<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building permit fees in<span>\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s6\">Cedar Hill<\/span>, southwest of the city\u2019s center, are determined by square footage. There is a set fee of<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$400<\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span>for any renovation of less than 1,250 square feet. For each additional square foot over 1,250, the permit increases by<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$.60<\/strong>. After 2,500 square feet, it increases by<span>\u00a0<\/span><strong>$.40<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enjoy making your Dallas home your own.

A good rule of thumb for Dallas homeowners is to limit spending on a renovation project to 10-20% of your total home value. This helps control the budget while ensuring you\u2019ll get maximum resale value for the renovation itself.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1639486987456\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong><u>How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Dallas?<\/u><\/strong><\/strong>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Budget-conscious Dallas homeowners should budget $15,000 and more for a simple kitchen remodel.
