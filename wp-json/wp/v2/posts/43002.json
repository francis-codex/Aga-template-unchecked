I wanted to take on other aspects of the business and started to learn framing, drywall and finish carpentry. A few years later, I was blessed with the opportunity to work for a 55-and-over community developer. Along with three other very experienced managers, I oversaw the build-out of 285 condos. I\u2019d say it was this experience that really cemented my career in homebuilding. When the last community neared completion, I\u00a0 started<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0<span style=\"color: #333333;\">my own company\u00a0<\/span><\/span>and to date, we have completed hundreds of projects in New York City, as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you love most about your job?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love educating the homeowner and giving them the opportunity to really understand all of the costs associated with their project and the different possibilities<span style=\"color: #333333;\">. I also enjoy the strategic and systematic building process and the satisfaction of seeing a project\u2019s beauty when completed.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the biggest challenge you face when renovating in New York?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For homeowners, it\u2019s the financial weight of preconstruction services needed to meet the requirements of the building\u2019s management companies, building architects, insurance fees, and DOB requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For general contractors, it is getting materials into and out of the buildings, parking, competing against other contractors that are not properly insured, and restricted working hours implemented by the buildings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception homeowners have when starting a renovation project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest misconception I find is that most people feel that they can create a scope and budget before properly planning a project. It is very important to determine if you have a fixed scope and flexible budget or a flexible scope and a fixed budget. Once this is established, you can properly plan a project by creating a wishlist.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We deliver 100 percent transparency, explain all best and worst-case scenarios to avoid any surprises, are clear and precise in our communications, and take pride in our finished product. We also have a great user interface app\/portal that our clients can use on-demand to manage all aspects of their project. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What is your favorite project you have done?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would have to be a fundraiser that was put together on Long Island. It was a complete gut renovation of a home for a family with a handicapped daughter and ill husband\/father. We have done a few fundraisers but this one was really special. When the family moved back into the home, the looks on their faces just made our hearts melt. Everyone on this project had a feeling you just cannot describe when it was completed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43018 mb-10 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Aaron-Projects.gif\" alt=\"Sweeten general contractor Aaron's home renovation projects\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><span class=\"img-label\"> <em>Aaron has been a Sweeten general contractor since January 2019.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a>\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
