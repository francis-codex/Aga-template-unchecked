Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space\u00a0is\u00a0often an afterthought. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!<\/p>\n<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43214\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen banquette\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/nyc\/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jenn and Jon<\/a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in.\u00a0Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.<\/p>\n<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-41636\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg\" alt=\"dining nook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elizabeth and Martin<\/a>\u2019s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team.

The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic.
