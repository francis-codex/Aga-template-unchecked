Instead, she painted the lower portion in a darker gray, which masked the door\u2019s oak grain. She refaced the uppers and purchased new doors to change up the style slightly. They went from an arched to a simple raised panel that visually connects with the those below the counter. Hard-to-reach cabinets above the refrigerator were eliminated. All the upper cabinets were painted white, which made the space seem larger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44759\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-17-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-14.jpg\" alt=\"refaced kitchen cabinets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44758\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-kitchen-14-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>New floors<\/h3>\n<p>The <span class=\"s1\">existing brown kitchen floor tile was removed and red oak was installed to be consistent with the rest of the house, all stained in a honey hue. New hardware also refreshed the cabinet doors. The contractor also swapped out outdated tile for a feature mosaic under the range hood, and white subway tile on the remaining backsplash. New stainless steel appliances replaced a white refrigerator and dishwasher, as well as a black range, for a cohesive contemporary look. The room also received a new pull-down faucet, sink, and quartz countertop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWith some creative problem solving, it does look, feel, and function like <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/7-kitchen-trends-well-see-in-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a totally new kitchen<\/a>,&#8221; she said. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Without changing the kitchen footprint, she still picked up additional space. She calls her new walk-in pantry \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d The walk-in pantry is located just off the main kitchen, in part of what was the garage. \u201cEveryone told me a garage conversion for storage was not a good idea because the space was just too small,&#8221; she recalled.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg\" alt=\"Hamptons kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44609\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>Garage-turn-living room<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A crucial step in the Southampton home renovation was to have the 14\u2019 x 24\u2019 garage gutted, creating a new living room. The new room features a vaulted ceiling and a shiplap fireplace, as well as that walk-in pantry. Converting the garage expanded the 800-square-foot home to 1,350 square feet of living space. The homeowner wanted the fireplace to be a focal point. &#8220;I chose shiplap, <\/span>but the way it was executed was beyond my expectations,&#8221; the homeowner recalled. A shift in the spacing and a slightly larger scale made a huge difference. It was built up to the point of the vault and a thick slate mantle instead of a wood one made it a true statement piece. &#8220;My contractor designed and built it himself,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-livingroom-1.jpg\" alt=\"ranch living room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Rosaire-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-livingroom-23.jpg\" alt=\"vaulted ceiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-44760\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-livingroom-23.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-livingroom-23-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-livingroom-23-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>A camouflaged finish<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additional storage, refrigeration, and less-used items moved into her new pantry. &#8220;I put my microwave and other small appliances behind closed doors,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;It\u2019s still super convenient because it\u2019s attached to the kitchen.\u201d <\/span><span class=\"s1\">The exterior roofline did not change. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to look like a garage conversion <\/span><span class=\"s1\">from the outside,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I built false carriage-style doors on the front exterior so it still looks like a garage.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"open-livingroom-diningroom-combo\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-44756 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-diningroom-16.jpg\" alt=\"open living and dining room combo with hardwood floors and white brick fire place after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-diningroom-16.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-diningroom-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Rosaire-diningroom-16-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Blue, white, and gray palette<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She settled on a mostly white color palette with some gray accents, including new charcoal paint on the exterior fa\u00e7ade.
