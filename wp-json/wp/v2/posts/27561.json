Previously, the couple, along with their dog Maxie, squeezed into a studio for four years to save for their first home purchase. They found themselves leaning towards co-op buildings in Clinton Hill, which provided larger living spaces as well as more modern features (at least more modern than a prewar apartment). \u201cWe fell in love with the neighborhood and the flexibility the\u00a0spaces had with converting the apartments,\u201d said Daniel. That was in 2015. Since then they have been planning their renovation as well as starting a family.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27588 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27874 size-chrono\" title=\"new floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"new floor plan\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a>The goal of the renovation was to simultaneously create a nursery from a small dining space off the living room while opening up the apartment to be more conducive to entertaining, as well as fix water-damaged floors. They turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3925\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their contractor from Sweeten<\/a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. \u201cWe wanted to optimize the small square footage of the space and ideally achieve unobstructed sightlines throughout,\u201d said Daniel. The couple was intent on incorporating a mid-century look in the decor and furniture. Above all, they needed to do all this within their budget and in time for the baby\u2019s arrival. They were fortunate enough to live with family nearby, \u201cbut we can\u2019t imagine what things would have been like if we had to live in the space during the renovation,\u201d said Daniel.\u00a0The close proximity allowed them to check in on the progress of their renovation about once a day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/brooklyn-couple-adds-nursery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full\" title=\"How Sweeten Works\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/CTA-Yellow-Round.png\" alt=\"How Sweeten Works\" width=\"288\" height=\"52\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The kitchen was the biggest part of the renovation. In the original design, a cupboard stood between the kitchen and the living space. As glorious as storage is in an apartment, it had to be sacrificed in order to connect the kitchen to the living room. Luckily, there was dead space near the front door entryway and the couple\u2019s Sweeten contractor was able to carve out a storage closet. Huge drawers in the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">island<\/a>, as well as cabinets that went to the ceiling, also made up for lost storage. And of course, \u201ca little <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vogue.com\/article\/marie-kondo-closet-organizing-cleaning-konmari-spark-joy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marie Kondo<\/a>-style purging\u201d helped limit what actually needed to be stored.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-Before-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27583 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-Before-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27571 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-07-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-06-filter1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27585 size-chrono\" title=\"kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-06-filter1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27567 size-chrono\" title=\"view from the living room into the kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-14-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27569 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"view from the kitchen into the living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The\u00a0existing kitchen aesthetic was bland with pine cabinets and a sad beige countertop. For the new look, Daniel and Idalee went for a modern and industrial design that would blend with the more mid-century look of the living room in a color mix of white and grays. This was reflected in the kitchen <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tiles<\/a>, where the couple had a bit of fun. \u201cI would say that our kitchen floors are one of our favorite aspects,\u201d said Daniel, \u201dsince we didn\u2019t think we would be able to accomplish a mosaic tile floor with our budget.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As an added bonus, the Sweeten contractor found a hidden power outlet near the kitchen window. \u201cMy husband does a lot of cooking and having\u00a0an outlet allows us to use a fan to help regulate the temperature in the apartment,\u201d said Idalee. Their contractor also helped the duo decide where new power sources should go, especially since walls and outlets were removed during the renovation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-before1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27578 size-chrono\" title=\"before\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-before1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"before\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Before) The dining\u00a0space\u00a0converted into the nursery, and the living room wall on the left came down.<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27576 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"entry to nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-13-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27575 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-11-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27574 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-10-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-09.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27573 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27572 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-08-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daniel and Idalee worked with their architect Robert to place the walls and\u00a0convert the dining room into a nursery. They opted for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glass doors<\/a> to let the maximum amount of light into the living room. The glass also meant that they could keep an eye on their newborn child\u00a0from the next room. \u201cWhen he gets older, we will\u00a0put a curtain on the inside of the door that he can control and can ideally still let light through during the day,\u201d said Idalee.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The area near the front door with the new storage closet also needed a railing because of the lowered entryway. &#8220;We always knew we needed to add one when we had a child, so we included this as part of our renovation,&#8221; said Idalee. &#8220;The railing works great to section off the side of the stairs.&#8221; They also added a small white bench under the railing as a\u00a0sitting\u00a0area for putting shoes on and off. &#8220;It feels like a small mud room to us, which is nice to have in a small city apartment,&#8221; she said. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27565 size-chrono\" title=\"the family in the living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-02.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27568 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-15-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"second bedroom nursery\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>  Water damage to the original parquet floors needed to be fixed. With a little bit of luck, a\u00a0neighbor who was also renovating was able to donate some old flooring to replace the damaged section.\u00a0However, matching the rest of the older floor while patching up the problem area would be near impossible. Instead, the couple decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/repair-protect-wood-floors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refinish<\/a> the floors and change the shade from a golden oak to a\u00a0dark walnut.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To find their stellar Sweeten contractor, Daniel and Idalee had some help\u00a0from Sweeten Client Services; their advisor also offered to join phone calls with the couple and potential contractors. \u201cWe really can\u2019t say enough about how great it was using the Sweeten service,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cSweeten is certainly a fan favorite among the Clinton Hill co-ops.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though their renovation ran on time and within budget, it certainly was \u201cnothing like you see on HGTV,\u201d said Daniel.
