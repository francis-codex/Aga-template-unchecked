However, underestimating overhead costs on a project often cuts into the profit. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> outlines how to manage the cost of your business within a renovation project estimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>How does Sweeten work with general contractors?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Contractors pay only when they win a project. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Project Estimating Tip 1: Estimating Overhead<\/span><\/h3>\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Indirect overhead<\/span><\/h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ongoing, or indirect, overhead items keep a business running long term.\u00a0 There are a number of indirect or ongoing costs. These may include:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Salaries and benefits for employees<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Office costs, such as rent, utilities, supplies<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Vehicle costs<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Insurance<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marketing costs, including Sweeten fees<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Professional services including accountants, attorneys<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Software licenses<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Think of these expenses as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; as they allow you to get in the game and operate a successful business. For that reason, many general contractors spread these costs evenly over a number of projects by incorporating them into their overhead and categorizing them as marketing. Others build it into their overhead on a project to project basis. It\u2019s a key decision a contractor needs to make when they\u2019re running their business. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a personal decision! The important point is to treat these fees as business expenses, and not as a reduction in profit. <\/span><\/p>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Direct overhead<\/span><\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Direct overhead costs are costs for specific projects. Here are some examples:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Equipment rental<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Job site utilities<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Additional insurance, when required<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manpower for non-labor charges, such as accepting deliveries and ordering materials<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">Project marketing expenses<\/span>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s3\">For example, the fees for Sweeten\u2019s services provide <\/span><span class=\"s4\">business development and marketing, opportunities for free photography\/blog and social media promotion, peace of mind, and consumer protections for clients that are designed to help our GCs win.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Include anything that does not fall under materials or labor that affects the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Project Estimating Tip 2: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Presenting P and O Estimates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Some contractors lump profit and overhead costs together. However, separating the two offers an opportunity for the contractor. Most clients don&#8217;t understand the expenses of running a business. Many people assume the profit and overhead number is mostly profit\u2014and they will try to get the GC to reduce it. Separate the two, and it could lead to a better understanding of what is behind the estimate. It explains the cost of doing business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One helpful strategy is to list some of the overhead items that benefit the client.\u00a0 They will appreciate the transparency and help them understand what they\u2019re paying for. Offering this could separate the contractor from other firms bidding on the project. The client should know if the GC will purchase more insurance or special equipment to make the project successful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Project Estimating Tip 3: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Estimating Profits<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Many GC&#8217;s use a standard profit percentage for their renovation project estimates. <\/span><span class=\"s4\">It is a fairly common practice for GCs to increase or decrease the percentage based on different job factors. A contractor might reduce their profit margins if it looks like the project will run very smoothly. Perhaps a client already has materials on-site, so changes or delays due to delivery issues are unlikely. Some of Sweeten&#8217;s GCs will give a small discount on profit to lock in the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, the reverse is also true! Projects that appear more difficult for some reason. For example, projects where the clients have a difficult time making decisions and you anticipate delays.\u00a0 Those types might include a higher profit margin in the bid. This will give you a cushion to fall back on when problems crop up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">Project Estimating Tip 4: <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Change Orders and Options<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Changes happen on many projects. Account for your cost by including profit and overhead items in the change order procedure. Above all, be sure to be upfront with this practice in the initial contract you sign with the client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The same is true if options, or add-ons, are included in the estimate. Include the profit and overhead in the renovation project estimate for the add-on. In those cases, the profit and overhead are combined with the estimated costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>Beat the competition with fair, profitable renovation project estimates<\/h5>\n<p>We hope our guide to adding profit and overhead costs to your renovation project estimates was helpful!
