A friend of ours recommended a Sweeten architecture team, who were kind enough to take on our project even though it\u2019s smaller than jobs they normally do. Walking through the space, we discussed whether to tackle the floors now or later and how to get more space out of the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57247 size-full\" title=\"kitchen before renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen before remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57259 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Ali-and-Mark-Apt-01.gif\" alt=\"White and wood West Village kitchen remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57251 size-full\" title=\"renovated kitchen\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-03.webp\" alt=\"Kitchen peninsula\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-03.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-03-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-03-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We agreed that ripping up the floor could expose even bigger, potentially budget-restrictive problems and that a new stain might sufficiently improve the overall vibe. In the kitchen, we all suspected, based on the footprint of the unit above ours, that the eastern wall (the wall with the sink, refrigerator, and range) was encroaching on the interior space more than it needed to be, and that it might be hiding a window (a window looking out on a dark airshaft, but still, a window.) The architects came by and knocked some holes in the wall and confirmed that suspicion, which we took into account while drawing up plans.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57249 size-full\" title=\"kitchen before renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-04.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen before remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57260 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Ali-and-Mark-Apt-05.gif\" alt=\"Moving image of the remodeled kitchen cabinet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The bathroom evokes the best possible reaction: that unique combination of joy and surprise.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It became clear pretty quickly that the window we found wasn\u2019t going to make an appearance in the new kitchen (its height would conflict with counter height and it wouldn\u2019t let much light in, anyway). It was\u00a0hidden again behind the wall, but we did push the surface back to gain another foot or so of width, which feels like a big win. The only drawback was the repositioned wall now exposed a water pipe; we decided to just build the counter and shelves around it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57252 size-full\" title=\"slide-out spice rack\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-06.webp\" alt=\"Spice drawer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-06.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-06-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-06-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57253 size-full\" title=\"kitchen island\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-07.webp\" alt=\"Marble counter peninsula\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-07.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-07-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-07-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57258 size-full\" title=\"wood floors\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-12.webp\" alt=\"Newly stained wood floors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-12.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-12-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-12-600x400.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Our main ask in the kitchen was some open shelving for easy access to plates and glassware (we know, we know, such a thing right now) and as much storage as possible. And we wanted an island to eat at and chop on, which was probably pushing it in terms of the square footage. The Sweeten architects devised this <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/polished-kitchen-peninsula-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great peninsula<\/a> that\u2019s like a Swiss Army knife. It has tons of cabinets and drawers on one side, shelves along the other, and still plenty of space to sit and eat.<\/p>\n<p>They also drew up this narrow pantry concept and stuffed it into an unused sliver of space between the peninsula and the fridge, and my, does this pantry change everything. Cabinet storage is even double-stacked above the fridge. Sometimes it feels like we have too much kitchen storage.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57250 size-full\" title=\"bathroom before renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-05.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom before remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-AliMark-Before-05-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57254 size-full\" title=\"bathroom after renovation\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-08.webp\" alt=\"Wet room style bathroom with green tile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-08.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-08-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-08-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The <span style=\"color: #000000;\">bathroom<\/span> is approximately 12 square feet. I\u2019ve been in showers larger than our entire bathroom. Nobody wants to feel bummed out when they\u2019re showering. Ali had this idea to cover the entire thing in big bright tile, like some bathrooms we\u2019d seen while traveling. The architects delivered on this with green and white (er, \u201clawn\u201d and \u201cmilk\u201d) cement tiles from Morocco, which we absolutely loved. This quickly became the most exciting part of the project. They also found a really nice rain shower and toilet, both of which are thrilling to use in their own ways.<\/p>\n<p>There is no curtain, just a gentle slope in the floor to drain the water. When you shower, half the bathroom gets drenched but miraculously not the sink area. Because the shower isn\u2019t enclosed, it really feels like the entire bathroom turns into a shower.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the work was cosmetic. The Sweeten contractors sanded the scuffed up old wood floors and we picked a new, darker stain, a mixture of a couple of stain options we\u2019d sampled. We also continued the hardwood from the living room area into the kitchen, which had been a kind of gray faux-wood beforehand. Our architects thankfully talked us out of whitewashed floors, which would have been hell to keep clean. We also shaved down the mantle from the living room\u2019s (non-working) fireplace, and tore out a pointless little closet in the corner next to it. After the work was done, Mark installed bookshelves here.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57255 size-full\" title=\"shower \" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp\" alt=\"Shower with green and white patterned tile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-09-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-57256 size-full\" title=\"bathroom sink\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-10.webp\" alt=\"Small bathroom remodel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-10.webp 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-10-200x300.webp 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/31220-Mark-and-Ali-KitchBath-10-600x900.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All of the apartment\u2019s doorknobs were replaced, many of which didn\u2019t quite work, and several weird chandeliers were taken out of the kitchen and bedroom closet that had probably been there forever. These little things helped the space so much, making all the little pieces feel intentional.<\/p>\n<p>The architects&#8217; overall aesthetic was evident by the use of light wood tones throughout which contrast the new dark floors, and the white Carrara marble on the backsplash and island catching the sunlight from the windows. We tried to echo these choices with furnishings wherever possible.<\/p>\n<p>Our Sweeten contractors handled the majority of the renovation work and a custom millworker installed the kitchen and worked really fast. We were basically living out of hotels or staying with relatives while we waited out the work. We probably asked for some unrealistic things in terms of the timeline\u2014the project took about eight weeks from start to finish\u2014but it managed to be delivered on time.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve now been living in the space about four months and are thrilled by how it turned out. The sunlight is so good and the dark floors are beautiful. The kitchen has clown-car-levels of hiding places. And, of course, the bathroom, which is both fun to use and fun to show off. When we open the door there\u2019s always a moment when people are caught a little off guard by the green tile. It evokes the best possible reaction: that unique combination of joy and surprise.<\/p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Ali and Mark, for sharing your West Village renovation with us!\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Wood floor<span style=\"color: #333333;\"> stain, 50\/50 mix of Jacobean and Provincial: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minwax.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minwax<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span>Custom kitchen cabinets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.interiors-palace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Interiors Palace<\/a>.
