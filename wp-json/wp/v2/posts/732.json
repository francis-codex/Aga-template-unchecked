In the architecture offices where I worked I spent hours locked in conference rooms with colleagues agonizing about the height of a baseboard, the profile of a window mullion, and the location of a light switch.<\/p>\n<p>These are details that aren&#8217;t important to a client and don&#8217;t often affect the overall impact of a project.  But architects agonize over things like this; it&#8217;s part of what they do.  For my kitchen remodel I spent hours deciding between different cherry wood stains, different shades of white paint, and different cabinet door knobs.<\/p>\n<p>In the end details that I thought were highly important were not carried out.  For my bathroom I thought it was crucial to reproduce the tiny 1\/32&#8243; tile grout joints from the original walls.  A typical ceramic wall tile grout joint is 1\/8&#8243; but I felt that this size joint was simply too wide, too crude, and that it would detract from the beauty of the tile.  I even had a bad dream about it.  In this dream I returned to my bathroom after a week-long holiday and found my shower walls finished with 1\/2&#8243; tile joints.  I awoke with a start!<\/p>\n<p>In the end, almost as a comeuppance, my bathroom was completed with 1\/8&#8243; grout joints.  This was entirely my own fault.  The tiler began his work very early one morning, before I or the site supervisor could speak to him.  I&#8217;ll never forget walking onto site that day and seeing all the tile laid out on my bathroom walls, absolutely beautifully, and set apart with 1\/8&#8243; spacers.  The mason was beaming.  He turned to me and said, &#8220;Look at how much I&#8217;ve completed already.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t ask him to redo the work; he&#8217;d done exactly what was expected.  So instead I took a very deep breath.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-762\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg\" alt=\"Tile Comparison\" width=\"540\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg 540w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/TILE-COMPARISON-300x87.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the end the bathroom walls turned out beautifully.  The cream-colored grout that we had selected in order to miminize staining brought out a golden hue in the glaze of the tile.  The original 1\/32&#8243; joints that I had wanted had created a colder, more clinical surface.  The 1\/8&#8243; joints, which I had abhorred, gave the entire room a warmer, more welcoming feeling.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Architects tend to be perfectionists and also indecisive, which is a dangerous combination.
