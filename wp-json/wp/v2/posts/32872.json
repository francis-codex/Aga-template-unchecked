I grew up there and moved to Newark, Delaware when I was 10.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been in the field of architecture and design since 2004.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">David<\/span>:\u00a0Originally from Wilmington, Delaware. I have been involved in the construction industry in some form since 1986.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Megan<\/span>:\u00a0I started my career as an interior\u00a0designer, but always worked for architects in a role that more closely resembled an interior architect rather than a designer or decorator. During the recession, I was lucky enough to retain my job but shifted studios within the large firm I was working for and made the decision to pursue my architectural license. Dave put up with me during a year of maniacal studying while working full time and taking those exams to get the license.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">David<\/span>:\u00a0\u00a0I started life in finance. I worked for a large financial company for over 12 years. At the same time, I had a side life in construction. I soon learned that I enjoyed seeing things get built rather than just moving numbers around. I made a bold decision to change my life to do something that challenges me every day in a way that I can enjoy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Megan and David<\/span>: Transforming old run-down spaces into beautiful places that people can enjoy with their families.\u00a0We\u00a0really\u00a0enjoy\u00a0going into\u00a0different\u00a0buildings\u00a0throughout the city that we&#8217;ve\u00a0never been in to get a different taste of the city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Megan<\/span>:\u00a0Designing spaces that maximize the layout and function for our clients while still meeting the (sometimes seemingly ridiculous) NYC Building Code restrictions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">David<\/span>:\u00a0Constraints: limited timeframes, limited building hours, unhappy neighbors, logistics for material deliveries, logistics moving crew to projects.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/a-renovation-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-32502 size-chrono\" title=\"Renovation Checklist\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg\" alt=\"Renovation Checklist\" width=\"723\" height=\"143\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-300x59.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-600x119.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist.jpg 975w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Megan and David<\/span>: We\u00a0highly\u00a0value communication and feel it is the most important part of the process.
