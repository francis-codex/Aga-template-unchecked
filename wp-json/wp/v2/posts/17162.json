Staircases built before the 1950s often have a tread of about nine inches with a nine-inch rise. As a result, the vertical and horizontal pieces are evenly sized. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.phila.gov\/li\/codesandregulations\/Pages\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Code Council<\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(used by the City of Philadelphia and many surrounding municipalities) now calls for more tread and less height: requiring a 10.5-inch tread with a maximum rise of 7.75 inches. The code also requires a minimum width of 36 inches, expanding older conventions where a staircase might be as slim as 26 inches. The trick here is that old construction is grandfathered in and doesn\u2019t run afoul of the code, unless you decide to replace what\u2019s there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 class=\"p1\">Winder stairs code<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staircases that wind around corners can also be problematic. In its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.phila.gov\/media\/20190521124726\/Philadelphia_Rowhouse_Manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">historical guide to rowhouses<\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the City\u2019s planning commission refers to these as \u201cwinders,\u201d where stairs spiral out from a single point. Because of poor safety\u2014walking down is difficult\u2014adding \u201cwinders\u201d is now illegal in major renovations and new construction. So, you can keep any existing, older winder staircases; but replacing them brings new requirements that might be challenging to fit in the house\u2019s dimensions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How a new staircase can affect your floor plan<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to replace a staircase, you must meet current codes. In older homes, this causes problems. As the code calls for a longer tread and a lower rise, a new staircase typically needs to be longer to reach between floors, and will overshoot the current length. In homes with a small footprint, new staircase dimensions can end up awkwardly jutting out against a wall or door. In some cases, you can add a slight turn to the new staircase design to minimize length. Additionally, you may be able to elevate some of the overhead floor to accommodate the additional length, but in many cases, refurbishing what you have will be the least invasive solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Structural work and permits needed for a new staircase build<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Constructing a new staircase requires building permits and your plans will also need the approval of a structural engineer or a registered architect. Prepare yourself for electrical and plumbing implications (and permits) if your designs involve layout or structural changes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many older staircases are typically walled-in on one or both sides. With current housing trends calling for an open plan, most homeowners want to open up at least one side of a staircase, either partially or in full. These walls on the side of the stairs are usually always load-bearing and therefore structural. Building <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/renovating-in-the-northeast\/renovating-philadelphia-heres-need-know\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">permits and approvals in Philadelphia<\/a> by either a structural engineer or a registered architect will be required.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Reasons to build a new staircase<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety and accessibility are the biggest reasons to bring in a new staircase. Consider treads that cannot fit a whole foot, steep rises between stairs, a winding path, and a slim fit between wall and railing. These aspects aren\u2019t easy to navigate and can affect use for people of all ages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to renovate an existing staircase<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Updating the <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/entire-home-renovations\/trinity-home-renovation-philadelphia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aesthetics of an existing staircase<\/a> will be less invasive and probably won\u2019t need building permits. There are ways to refurbish a staircase without changing the structure. \u201cReplace the treads, risers, or railing\u201d if you\u2019re looking for an update, advises Philadelphia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten<\/a> contractor Kenny. \u201cIf you keep the existing opening through the floor above, you\u2019ll avoid the requirement for a code-compliant stair, which might not fit in your home.\u201d You can also update the stringers (which support the treads) by adding material to strengthen or enhance them, he continued.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other changes to consider include adding or removing carpeting; updating the banister style; changing the wood type over the staircase\u2019s substructure; or laying down tile.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding the right general contractor in Philadelphia for a staircase remodel<\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s clear that remodeling a staircase in a home, especially a historic or older home, can be challenging. For example, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Philly rowhouses vary in size but are typically small to moderately-sized with Trinities and Bandboxes coming in at 400 to 600 square feet. <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Renovating a Philadelphia rowhouse<\/a> requires experienced contractors who understand the rules and codes for working in these types of structures. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post your project<\/a> and we&#8217;ll connect you with the right contractors.<\/span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Updated July 28, 2023<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8212;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
