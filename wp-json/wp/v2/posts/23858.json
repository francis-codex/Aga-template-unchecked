His current home, a 1,800-square-foot house in Elmhurst, was definitely <em>not<\/em> a loft, but it was ideal\u00a0for him and his wife in many other ways. It was close to both of their jobs, as well as to both sets of parents, and they loved having a backyard right off the kitchen. So they decided to do the next best thing: make\u00a0their home\u00a0as &#8220;loft-like&#8221; as a house could be, most notably opening\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">up walls so the space would have an airy feel. Finally, it came time to tackle the tight, closed-off kitchen. Here are the details on a long-awaited kitchen renovation (and a few extras!) befitting two avid cooks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23870 size-chrono\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23862 size-chrono\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"loft apartment\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23860 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-01\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23865\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-09-10\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">After\u00a0living in his home for close to ten years, Romuald knew that a new kitchen could dramatically\u00a0change how his family used the space. He and his wife love cooking together, so they wanted to create a new kitchen in which two (or more!) people could comfortably work. Upon his wife&#8217;s recommendation, he\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/11008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">turned to Sweeten<\/span><\/a>\u00a0for help and found\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his\u00a0<span class=\"s2\">contractor<\/span><\/a>\u00a0for the project. The original kitchen featured dark wood cabinets and felt cave-like because of a wall separating it from the main living space. Wanting to demolish the wall, it was necessary to regain the storage space by adding an island. It also afforded an\u00a0extra work surface and an\u00a0unobstructed sightline across the whole first floor of the house for a loft apartment feel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Working with their contractor, the couple came up with a plan for their new kitchen. The original flooring was a tile that contrasted with the hardwood running through the rest of the first floor. They wanted to continue the wood look but opted for a gray \u201cwood\u201d porcelain that would be much easier to maintain (important for a kitchen that sees a lot of action!). <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Semi-custom cabinets<\/a> made it possible for creative storage solutions like an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; (details below) to be incorporated into the kitchen plan. The warm gray cabinets they chose from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.waypointlivingspaces.com\/cabinets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Waypoint<\/span><\/a> coordinated with the new <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flooring<\/a>. A white quartz countertop and classic marble subway tile for the backsplash brought\u00a0a clean yet\u00a0contrasting look. Above the stove, they installed a pot-filler to save the job of hauling a heavy pot of water from the sink on the island to the stovetop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23866 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"microwave\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-11-12.gif\" alt=\"microwave\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Romuald and his wife started shopping around to replace all of their appliances with the exception of their investment appliance\u2014a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thermador.com\/us\/products\/ranges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Thermador<\/span><\/a> range with blue knobs. After visiting appliance stores and making product choices, \u00a0he came across one of his favorite finds\u2014the microwave drawer! A built-in microwave was placed high on their wish list so that it wouldn\u2019t take up valuable counter space like their previous one did. When he came across the drawer, he knew that it was the way to go.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Next, their Sweeten contractor suggested the genius solution of an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221;\u2014a much-loved-but-seldom-seen feature in city\u00a0apartments. This storage unit\u00a0would house their toaster, coffeemaker, as well as a few odds and ends, with outlets built into the back keeping a tangle of cords contained. With the \u201cgarage door\u201d lowered, the counters would look instantly\u00a0cleaner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">In the spot where a dividing wall originally stood, they installed an island. While they had intended to build one about six feet long, it ultimately expanded to a 10-foot-long island\u2014a decision that Romuald doesn\u2019t regret one bit. \u201cWe can fit four stools along one side, while the other side has enough space for our farmhouse sink, microwave drawer, and dishwasher\u2014and with storage room, too!\u201d Given the space now has the open feel of a loft apartment,\u00a0they can now watch the TV in their living room from the kitchen. Romuald explains, \u201cWe have it on a swivel, so we just swing it around and can cook and watch TV at the same time. This is great for unwinding after a long day\u2019s work.\u201d They also love the way that the breeze flows through the entire space when they open the door to the backyard\u2014something that wasn\u2019t possible with walls in the way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23861 mb-24 size-chrono\" title=\"loft apartment\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-23867\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">While the project took a bit longer than anticipated due to delays in delivery of materials, Romuald reports that they are very\u00a0happy with the way it all turned out. And although they had intended on just renovating the kitchen, the project expanded in the end to include new floors throughout the entire living space, as well as a new railing for the stairs leading to the second floor of their house. All of these changes have made their house a dream home for the couple!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Thank you, Romuald for sharing your new, loft-like space with us!<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">KITCHEN RESOURCES:<b>\u00a0<\/b>Semi-custom cabinets in gray:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.waypointlivingspaces.com\/cabinets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Waypoint<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0Marble subway tile backsplash:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebuilderdepot.com\/cama3xsutipolished.html?ref=lexity&amp;_vs=shopzilla&amp;_vm=productsearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Builder Depot<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Florida Tile 8\u201d x 36\u201d porcelain floor tile in magnolia ash: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classictilenewyork.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic Tile<\/a>.
