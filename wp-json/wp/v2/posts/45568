What does accessible design mean?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To some, &#8220;<strong>aging in place&#8221;<\/strong> is a design term that means creating living spaces that are safe and accessible for people who want to stay in their homes and care for themselves as they grow older. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To others, the term <strong>&#8220;accessible design&#8221;<\/strong> or &#8220;living in place&#8221; is more applicable, as it means designing spaces that suit the needs of children and adults in one home. In both cases, the goal is to create living spaces that are, safe, accessible, and also make design sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> gives an overview of aging in place design costs, plus costs for accessible designs, and gives tips for when these designs can be beneficial to the family lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How much does accessible design cost?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When part of a major renovation, the cost to include accessible techniques can be minor. &#8220;Things don&#8217;t necessarily need to cost more, they are just different,&#8221; said <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Julie Schuster of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jlsdesignstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Julie Schuster Design Studio<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> and is a certified living in place professional (CLIPP). &#8220;If you are remodeling a kitchen you probably want under cabinet lighting. Why not upgrade slightly to add bright LED lights that are good for aging eyes?&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two approaches to accessible living spaces:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Remodel to suit the urgent needs of the homeowner. <\/b>\u00a0A wheelchair user will need, among other things, wide doorways and hallways, and a curbless shower with a bench and grab bars. A family with young children may want night lights in the hallways, non-slip bathroom floor tiles, and anti-scald shower valves.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Remodel to make the design flexible for future improvements.<\/b> &#8220;It is important to learn the things that could crop up in the future and then design backward for them. I install blocking behind a shower wall while renovating, so grab bars or a built-in bench can be added later. Putting in the blocking does not add to the overall cost,&#8221; said Kammi Reiss of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kammireissdesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">Kammi Reiss Design<\/span><\/a>.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4914#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">Sweeten contractor Aaro<\/span>n<\/a>, being flexible in design is key. In one condo project, they placed a removable panel in front of the kitchen sink so a wheelchair user can roll up to the sink for use.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What does aging in place cost?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While many accessible design techniques have similar costs as any renovation project,\u00a0 some projects do have an increased cost. For example, the combination of slippery surfaces and a wet setting in bathrooms often cause accidents, especially for people with mobility issues or poor eyesight.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here&#8217;s a comparison from the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2021 Cost vs. Value Report<\/a> that compares a standard\u00a0 5-foot by 7-foot bathroom of mid-range quality to an accessible one of the same size. The accessible bathroom includes 36-inch-wide doors, flat panel electric switches installed at sitting level, walk-in curbless shower with fold-out seat, adjustable shower head, thermostatic mixing valve, LED lighting, ceramic tile walls with contrasting color stripes, towel bars (grab bars) that can support 250 pounds each, night lights, and reconfigured storage accessible to someone in a seated position, among other items.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here\u2019s an example of what universal design can recoup at resale at a national level.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Costs $24,424 recouping 60% at resale<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Standard universal design remodel: Costs $38,813 recouping 58% at resale<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<i>Remodeling<\/i> asked us to revise the remodeling project for them,&#8221; said Louie Delaware, co-founder of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livinginplace.institute\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Living in Place Institute<\/span><\/a>. &#8220;Everyone assumed that it would cost much more and would not be worth as much.&#8221;\u00a0 While there are increased costs, the return on investment is similar to that of the accessible bathroom.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Costs for accessible design projects:<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are some estimated costs for common projects often associated with accessible designs:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Entrance ramp: $1,300 to $ 3,500<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Door widening to accommodate wheelchairs: $400 to $800, each<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chair lift: $3,000 to $6,000, curved stairs will cost more<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Widening hallways (often includes moving plumbing, heating and cooling and electrical lines):\u00a0 $500 to $2,000<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Grab bars with decorative finishes: $100 to $200, each<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Curbless showers: $2,000 to $8,000<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Faucets with lever controls: $200 to $400<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many of the techniques used in accessible design or aging in place design are the same, whether planning for yourself, someone who wants to age in place, or to suit the needs of a growing family.
