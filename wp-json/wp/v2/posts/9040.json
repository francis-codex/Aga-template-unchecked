Almost immediately, the\u00a0enterprising\u00a0young journalists set out to make an important update to the space; the two love to cook, eat, &amp; entertain, but since their apartment, c. 1910, had very few updates made to it in the last 100 years, renovating the kitchen was top priority. Sarah &amp; Michael knew what they wanted for the new space, taking a direction rooted in the age &amp; tradition of the original home, rather than any Jetsonian ideal. So, with her own catalog of inspired ideas and a well-researched execution plan, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/1599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarah posted to Sweeten<\/a> to find the perfect contractor for the work. From their matches, the couple chose to work with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/818\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South Fork Projects<\/a>.\u00a0The charming new kitchen is a perfect model for the 21st C., traditional home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9137 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"721\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/02_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-befores-250x300.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though the original kitchen had charming bones,\u00a0the space was overwhelmed by warm, reddish wooden cabinets &amp; trim that made it feel dark &amp; dingy, and a full set of outdated appliances added to the overall drabness. Sarah &amp; Michael appreciated the traditional character that runs throughout the entire home, so they planned for a makeover that would not undermine the spirit of the architecture. After much deliberation, the sensible solution was to paint their existing cabinets.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8220;The lower cabinets were high-varnish, auburn-colored oak\u2014all contemporary, not original. Though they &#8216;clashed&#8217; in age with the old wood, they had the upside of being on new drawer tracks and in great condition. The upper cabinets, the hutch cabinet, and the dark hardware were original to the apartment, circa 1910, and their functionality (on new hinges) was fantastic, but they were riddled with wood putty spots and pockmarks from a century of use.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9138 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"721\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/03_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-durings-250x300.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prior to connecting with Gennadiy, the homeowners independently\u00a0sourced &amp; replaced the appliances and hired a painter who specializes in historic interiors for the cabinet painting. To transition the warm wooden scheme into something more modern feeling, that would also blend well with the addition of stainless steel appliances, the couple chose a light cool grey paint, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.benjaminmoore.com\/en-us\/redirects\/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=coolbreeze&#038;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BM Cool Breeze<\/a>. Sarah&#8217;s favorite element &#8212; and a worthwhile splurge alongside the economic cabinet update &#8212; is the range. The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajmadison.com\/cgi-bin\/ajmadison\/H304GGVCR.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bertazzoni Heritage Series in Matte Cream<\/a>\u00a0fits perfectly as a modern\u00a0throwback to an earlier tradition. At this stage, the homeowners were ready to move forward with Gennadiy for their countertop, sink, backsplash &amp; cabinet replacement glass.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9139 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/04_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The completed space is bright, cozy, and almost pastoral, with a balanced palette of warm and cool. The new palette was inspired partially by a similar scheme Sarah had come across in a book of Scottish country houses.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8220;Overall, the inspiration was as much outdoors as in\u2014I kept thinking of a kitchen you could imagine being right off of a sprawling herb or vegetable garden. Maybe if Beatrix Potter had a New York pied-a-terre.&#8221;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9140 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/05_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most inventive elements of the new design is the use of antiqued mirror panels in place of the former, contemporary set in frosted glass. This suggestion came from Sarah&#8217;s aunt as a way to increase the natural light in the space, but it also ties in perfectly with the vintage theme. Sarah sourced custom-cut, 12&#8243;x12&#8243; mirror-glass panels in &#8216;French Antique&#8217; finish from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.antiquemirrorglassshoppe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Timeless Reflections<\/a>. After installing the glass panels, Gennadiy sealed on &amp; painted wooden backings inside the cabinet doors to create a solid, clean construction. For the backsplash, Sarah &amp; Michael re-routed their initial plan to use wainscoting, and instead selected a classic-looking carrera marble subway tile.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9141 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/06_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finding a farm sink that would work well in the space proved to be the biggest challenge of the renovation, but, determined to find exactly what she was looking for, Sarah eventually lucked out with the last one available &#8212; perhaps, anywhere. A bridge <a href=\"https:\/\/rohlhome.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">faucet from Rohl&#8217;s Country Kitchen collection<\/a> completes the sink basin&#8217;s farmhouse look, and for the countertops, the homeowners chose Brazilian soapstone, fabricated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soapstones.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M. Teixeira<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&#8220;Gennadiy and I worked like dogs to find a fireclay farm sink that would work for a New York apartment kitchen. They\u2019re so heavy and so huge\u2014most are 30 inches wide and 10 inches deep, which would swallow the entire counter\u2014that we had to really scour for one small enough, shallow enough, and with the clean, traditional shape that I wanted. \u00a0This was the sole one that would work and, coincidentally, the very last one in a showroom I called. Even in its diminutive (by farm sink-standards) size, we still had to opt for an upmount to clear the plumbing and keep the top drawer functional. \u00a0I actually like the look of it better this way\u2014it makes more of a pronounced statement.&#8221;<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9142 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg\" alt=\"modern-traditional-manhattan-kitchen-renovation\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/07_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-SarahKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We love the antique, marble &amp; iron garden table from Italy, which Sarah purchased through a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.potomackcompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Potomack Company<\/a> auction.
