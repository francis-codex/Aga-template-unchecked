The place had been poorly maintained as a rental for many years (drop ceilings, temporary walls, very old roof, the works). It needed to be updated and modernized. The property was set up as a two-story, two-family house. There was an apartment on each floor\u2014one bath, one bedroom, a kitchen and a living room. New kitchens and bathrooms don\u2019t come cheap, and the renovation seemed daunting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31412 size-chrono\" title=\"happy-homeowners-baby-dining-room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"happy homeowners with baby in the dining room and hanging pendent light after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-07.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Floorplan-Before.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31413 size-chrono\" title=\"before floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Floorplan-Before-719x1017.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"719\" height=\"1017\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Floorplan-After.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31414 size-chrono\" title=\"after floor plan\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Floorplan-After-719x1009.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"719\" height=\"1009\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-09.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31411 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"dining room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-09-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had lived in a small studio and were used to an open floor plan. When we moved into the new house, it was small and blocked off from all of the other rooms. It made it difficult to chat and hang out with each other. We weren&#8217;t used to the feeling of being separated. Figuring out the best layout, style, and finishes were left to AJ and Robin Rathmann-Noonan, her sister and an interior designer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.robinr-n.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RobinR-N<\/a>. We were interested in an open entertaining space on the first floor with three bedrooms on the second floor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We were hoping that our renovation would be fast and straightforward. It was certainly not straightforward! Although the interior was designed and planned by Robin,\u00a0we had to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/when-do-you-need-an-architect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire an architect<\/a> and expeditor to draw and file the plans. We interviewed at least eight contractors, but the one we initially selected, and who filed the plans with the city, had underbid and sent us a contract that was overpriced.

In the kitchen, they looked to capture the light streaming through the back windows, and keeping the space as light and fresh as possible. &#8220;With the beautiful southern light at the back of the house and the openness of the view to the backyard, it made sense to\u00a0relocate the kitchen there and open the rest of the house up to that space,\u201d said Robin.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31423 size-chrono\" title=\"stairwell\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31422 size-chrono\" title=\"door-at-entrance-inside-outside\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif\" alt=\"door at the entrance from inside and outside after renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a>(Above) Entry door from the inside (l), and exterior front door (r)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>On mini-splits:\u00a0Ray had a hard time saying goodbye to the NYC radiators he had spent his entire life around.

The lightness of the kitchen helped connect the spaces visually from the front to the back of the home. &#8220;The dark floors and kitchen table and chairs made a nice contrast to white cabinets and the light Caesarstone countertops,&#8221; says Robin. The kitchen island\u00a0was a main feature of the space. From a recommendation from AJ and Robin\u2019s mom, it housed the sink and an open built-in shelving area at one end for cookbooks and some baby items, making use of every inch of space!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31427 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-03.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31425 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-03-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-04.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31426 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"living room\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe space was designed to accommodate the way they live,&#8221; explained Robin. &#8220;If someone is cooking or the baby is playing, the family and guests can congregate on the ground floor and still feel connected even if they are in different rooms.\u201d For lighting, they kept the ceilings minimalist, choosing surface-mount fixtures and pendants as a design focus.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31572 size-chrono\" title=\"during\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Master bedroom (l) and guest bedroom (r)<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-18.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31566 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-18-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Master bedroom<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-25.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31429 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"bedroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-25-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Guest bedroom<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-17.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31428 mb-0 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"nursery\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-17-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of layout, we had two options for a third bedroom: it could go in the front of the house with\u00a0a window, or in between the two other bedrooms where it currently sits. After working on the drawings, Robin determined that we could get more space using the space adjacent to the front bedroom than the space that is now a bathroom. According to the Department of Buildings code, we needed light and an egress to make sure that it could be called a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legal bedroom<\/a>. In order to accomplish this, we needed to put a skylight into the middle bedroom as part of the roof update. It seemed odd at the time, but in the end, the room ended up being perfect for the baby, who we were already expecting when the renovation began.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31573 size-chrono\" title=\"during\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n(Above) Second-floor stairway<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-26.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31431 mb-0 mt-24 size-chrono\" title=\"stairwell\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-26-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, although we wanted air conditioning in the house,\u00a0central air was a huge financial commitment. Mini-splits were suggested, but our past landlords had put a unit in our old apartment near the end of our time there, which we liked functionally but not aesthetically. After much back and forth, we decided on a ducted mini-split system so that the air-handling units were hidden in the ceilings; we only lost a little height in the first-floor hallway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31432 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-31434 mb-0 size-chrono\" title=\"bathroom\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02-723x1085.jpg\" alt=\"townhouse renovation\" width=\"723\" height=\"1085\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was an enormous undertaking for us, and as much of a rush that we were in with a baby on the way, we appreciated that our Sweeten contractor slowed us down and walked through the entire process with us, down to the details of the toilet paper holder. Our renovation was a <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/truth-design-build-firms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">design-build<\/a> job and our Sweeten\u00a0contractor had all the details of what needed to be done written down on paper for our review. We appreciated the attention to detail.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best advice we can give is to ask questions even when things get technical and you are in over your head. And be patient! Our main questions were: Can we afford this? What is the payment schedule? Can we finish the house before the baby arrives? What is your timeline?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We were most excited about having space, a real kitchen and closets, which was a huge change from where we were living before. When we worked on the interior layout, it seemed like we had planned for an extreme amount of storage space, but wouldn\u2019t you know, we\u2019ve managed to use it all!<\/p>\n<p>We are so glad that we found our Sweeten contractor\u2014we couldn\u2019t have been happier (or luckier!).<\/p>\n<p><em>Thanks to AJ and Ray for sharing your stunning townhouse with us!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Engineered Hardwood Faulkner Hickory floors: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hursthardwoods.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hurst Hardwoods<\/a>.
