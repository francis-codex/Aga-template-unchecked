Jockeying for square footage, countertops usually lose space to the sink, appliances, and small appliances. However, kitchen peninsulas and islands will do more than create an additional work surface and storage. They are an immediate focal point and you&#8217;d be hard-pressed not to immediately perch for coffee or for a chat.

Homeowners sometimes supplement this main section with mobile kitchen islands or carts. But true, cook-ready kitchen islands are permanently secured to the floor. Here, the kitchen island becomes a part of the kitchen itself<\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u2014<\/span><span class=\"s1\">an enhancement that helps the <\/span><span class=\"s3\">home\u2019s resale value.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Kitchen peninsulas offer storage and countertop room roughly similar in size to kitchen islands. They are secured to the floor for functionality and safety. One end is attached either to the wall or to existing counters and cabinets.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"s1\">In most cases, the peninsula stylistically matches the main counters\/cabinets. One popular layout is to attach the cabinet to the end of an L-shaped kitchen countertop. It becomes a U-shaped layout.\u00a0<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Benefits of the kitchen island designs<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Flexible spacing: <\/b>This type of cabinet should remain within basic spacing parameters. But within those parameters is a degree of flexibility that allows you to nudge the island to the spot that works best for you.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Instant social space: <\/b>If you host parties or dinners, or if you just want to draw family members closer, a kitchen island is a people magnet.<br \/><\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\"><b>Easy to mix styles: <\/b>All cabinetry and counters typically match.

If so, a kitchen island may be your best choice. A peninsula has a 90-degree cabinet angle creating a type of dead zone called a blind cabinet. While this space <i>can be<\/i> used, it is difficult to access.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">By contrast, kitchen island designs provide an unimpeded storage area under the countertops. If you think that you will want to eventually change or expand your kitchen, consider a kitchen island. It is easier to remove without affecting the main counter\/cabinet section.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have a small kitchen or a medium-sized space, choose a peninsula that is more efficient with space. Also, if you think that the kitchen island\u2019s detachment from the main area may deter use, then you should consider installing a kitchen peninsula.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\n\t\t<style

class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Space requirements<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The choice of a kitchen peninsula or kitchen island depends on the size and layout of the room. Adequate space between work centers must be maintained both for workflow and for safety. You must be able to open cabinet doors and dishwashers. You must also be able to freely access sinks and cooktops.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\">The industry group <\/span><span class=\"s5\">National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA) recommends that you keep 42 inches of space between the edge of an island or peninsula and any other counters, work centers, appliances, or walls. Increase that width to 48 inches if you expect to have more than one cook regularly working in the kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Walkways that are <i>not<\/i> work aisles (pass-throughs behind an island, for instance) should be no less than 36 inches wide.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Whether for an island or a peninsula, think in terms of an imaginary \u201ckitchen triangle\u201d created by three points: sink, refrigerator, and stove or cooktop. The three legs of the triangle should total no more than 26 feet, with no leg measuring less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Standard countertops rise 36 inches above floor level. If either the peninsula or island is intended to be a breakfast bar, that height may be raised to 42 inches (though it would then be used exclusively for eating, not for food preparation).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Electrical receptacles servicing all counter areas should be GFCI-protected (ground fault circuit interrupter).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43395 size-full mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Alex-Kitchen-Island-8.jpg\" alt=\"East Hampton open concept kitchen with island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Alex-Kitchen-Island-8.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Alex-Kitchen-Island-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Alex-Kitchen-Island-8-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Alex-Kitchen-Island-8-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>)<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alex and Jennifer&#8217;s<\/a>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #76808f;\">beach house kitchen\u00a0island features a cooktop, wine fridge, and seating<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Cost considerations<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The cost of adding either cabinet type is highly variable. Since countertop materials tend to be expensive, Sweeten <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/3275#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general contractor Claud<\/a> said that homeowners need to think about whether they want either style to have enough countertop overhang to serve as an eating area.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Concerning costs, Claud says that where you live is as important as what you&#8217;re building. &#8220;A detached single-family home will be different from a condo or townhouse, where costs can skyrocket.\u201d He noted that HOAs often require that remodel plans be drawn up by an architect, even in the case of adding either of these features.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Claud estimated that a 5-foot long, 36-inch high peninsula or island using semi-custom cabinets and quartz or solid surface countertops and with no amenities will cost $2,500 to $3,000. Amenities such as a sink or dishwasher add significantly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>Which is more expensive: a kitchen island or kitchen peninsula?<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They&#8217;re close, he said, with islands usually costing slightly less. Peninsulas often demand more patching and wall work than islands.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Design professionals rarely consider either an island or a peninsula to be inherently better than the other. Instead, it is a matter of your home, the available space within the kitchen, and your taste and desires. Either way, you\u2019ll be gaining the kitchen\u2019s most efficient workhorse in workspace and storage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, discuss with <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your Sweeten general contractor<\/a> which cabinetry works best in your space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries<\/i>: If you\u2019re on a tight timeline,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jdoqocy.com\/click-100545793-15162279\"><span class=\"s1\">Appliances Connection<\/span><\/a>\u00a0has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.

They are secured to the floor for functionality and safety, with one end attached either to the wall or to existing counters and cabinets. Because kitchen peninsulas protrude from cabinets, they provide space to tuck chairs or stools.
