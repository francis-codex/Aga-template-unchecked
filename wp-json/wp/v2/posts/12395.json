First, a few definitions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full\" title=\"How Sweeten Works\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/CTA-Yellow-Round.png\" alt=\"How Sweeten Works\" width=\"288\" height=\"52\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Should you go with custom or pre-fabricated cabinets?<\/h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Stock cabinets<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IKEA<\/a>&nbsp;is widely considered the go-to for stock cabinets. Unlike almost anyone else, they mass-produce a system of set sizes, colors, finishes, and features that you pick and choose. The pieces of your order are pulled from stock supplies and shipped to your home, where you need to handle both the assembly and installation. IKEA keeps its costs low because they are sending your order to you in pieces and because the materials they use are very inexpensive.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pre-fabricated cabinets<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.homedepot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Depot<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lowes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lowe\u2019s<\/a>,&nbsp;and other big-box national retailers are distributors of independent lines of cabinets. They offer a semi-custom option: like IKEA, you pick and choose from set sizes, colors, finishes, and features (though national retailers tend to have more options overall). Unlike IKEA, your order is then manufactured and assembled for you so that your cabinets arrive ready for installation. Because you have more choice in materials and construction, the range of prices varies more here. You will probably pay more upfront for higher-quality materials, but you may spend less on labor because the cabinets are assembled before they get to you for installation.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Custom cabinets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom cabinets are designed and constructed by hand based on your individual design. You define the sizes, materials, finishes, and features and your order is hand-crafted and delivered for installation.&nbsp;Because your choices for materials and construction are endless, the range of material and labor costs is very wide. The costs here are generally distributed between your choice of material and style, labor, and a more personalized design and customer service approach.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>High-end, built-to-order cabinet systems<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A small group of cabinet companies also offer cabinetry systems that are extremely high-end (<a href=\"https:\/\/bulthaup.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bulthaup<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.henrybuilt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Henrybuilt<\/a>&nbsp;are examples). These companies are known for beautiful and durable cabinet construction and best-in-industry warranties, but the bare minimum for even&nbsp;a small kitchen can easily exceed <strong>$20,000<\/strong>, so unlike other categories of cabinet construction, this option is only available if the starting point for your budget allows you to consider it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20453 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><br>\nCustom cabinets by Henrybuilt in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kavi and David&#8217;s kitchen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom cabinets might be less expensive than you think if your kitchen has limited space, lots of space, or an unusual layout.<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a tight kitchen, stock and pre-fabricated cabinets in standard sizes might not be worth the initial material savings because you will need more inventive labor to fit everything in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a large kitchen, extra depth or high ceilings give you an opportunity for additional storage and functionality. Non-standard cabinet heights and depths can bring value to your renovation and re-sale value. Multiple corners, awkward niches, and unusual footprints can be&nbsp;tough to outfit. Stock and pre-fab cabinets in standard sizes may force you to spend money on filler materials, wasted space, and labor for semi-custom adjustments.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M46pF7SpsME&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40762 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/QA-HiringGC.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"85\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/QA-HiringGC.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/QA-HiringGC-300x26.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/QA-HiringGC-600x51.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>\u201cIf you have a kitchen with corners or small spaces or an awkward layout, you may not actually save money on the total because you end up paying for filler materials and extra work to pull everything together.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;Sweeten contractors<\/i><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24618 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen remodel cost\" width=\"723\" height=\"1087\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-723x1087.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/SWEETEN_Eric_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><br>\n<span style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom cabinets in <\/span><a style=\"text-align: justify;\" href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/custom-woodwork-manhattan-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eric&#8217;s kitchen<\/a><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;designed and built by his <\/span><a style=\"text-align: justify;\" href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1368\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten contractor<\/a><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Custom cabinets might be worth extra money if you plan to stay for years, have kids or a high-traffic kitchen, or want personalized support.<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Semi-custom and custom cabinets offer higher&nbsp;quality materials in sturdier thicknesses that last longer.&nbsp;Particle board and MDF, two common materials for stock cabinets, are susceptible to water and have a shorter life span than plywood and wood. 1\/2\u201d particle board will not last as long as 3\/4\u201d or 1\u201d furniture-grade plywood cabinet bases, and solid wood doors and drawers will endure tougher handling over the years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom cabinets also typically use sturdier construction and joinery methods. Custom cabinetmakers will often use dovetail joints that interlock pieces of wood to distribute weight and stress more evenly, whereas stock nut, bolt, and nail methods isolate wear on a few points. They also offer options for tougher hardware elements like hinges and drawer sliders. In addition, custom cabinet makers generally provide a higher level of design support and customer assistance. They will do site visits, re-designs, and get a real person on the phone with you when you need it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might be absolutely fine to handle the ordering and delivery of a stock system, but if you hit a roadblock, custom cabinet companies expect to support you and respond personally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>\u201cOnce you order the IKEA materials and you pay for assembly and installation, you\u2019re not far off from a custom option that would last longer and provide more options \u2013 for a few extra thousand dollars, you may actually get a much better deal.&nbsp;Each time you take one of these steps up in material quality and thickness, you have a corresponding price and life span increase.\u201d &#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/1368\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten Expert Alan<br>\n<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20543 mb-24\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" \/><br>\nIKEA cabinets with custom doors by Semihandmade in <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/kitchens\/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Becky and Sarah&#8217;s kitchen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Cost aside, pre-fabricated cabinets might work best for you if your renovation timeline is speedy or you feel overwhelmed by choice.<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom cabinets have lengthier lead times.

And, a perceived weakness of pre-fabricated cabinets is actually a real strength: for many homeowners, unlimited choice is not necessarily desirable.

Pre-fabricated cabinets offer a pick-and-choose experience that requires less homework and decision fatigue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i>\u201cMany clients ask us what styles we offer and it can be hard to explain that it can be anything they imagine.
