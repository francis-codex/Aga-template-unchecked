After all, it&#8217;s warm in appearance, easy underfoot (especially compared to tile or stone), versatile in application thanks to the range of wood species and finishes available, and innately luxurious. From solid to engineered to salvaged, you\u2019re likely to find an option that suits your home\u2019s style as well as your lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Wood flooring prices can vary greatly, depending on where the flooring was manufactured, how it was made, how it was finished, and who\u2019s installing it. Base your decision on where the floor will go, and what type of activity those rooms will see. Flooring is an investment\u2014of resources and the time it takes to install it. Make the right choice, and you will enjoy your wood floor for probably as long as you want it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Consider your lifestyle<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">First, examine what the room or room(s) will be used for, how much traffic they will experience, and what kind. Wood can be enjoyed throughout most homes, with a few precautions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Will there be pets scratching\u00a0it with their nails? <\/span><span class=\"s1\">High heels from frequent entertaining? <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Toys from energetic little ones?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you expect grit consistently tracked from the front door or backyard? <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Does the room get loads of sunlight that could fade the surface in some areas? <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Is there the possibility of accidental yet prolonged exposure to water, next to a dishwasher or by a bathtub, which could cause the floor to swell? <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Today\u2019s hardwood flooring often features highly durable polyurethane coatings that are formulated to stand up to light or average wear, but you will need to commit yourself to a regular maintenance routine in order to keep the surface beautiful. And engineered versions, with a wood veneer backed by a composite that helps assure its stability (while slightly lowering the cost compared to its solid wood cousin), can sometimes go in environments that experience some moisture, like a basement or a bathroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full\" title=\"How Sweeten Works\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/CTA-Yellow-Round.png\" alt=\"How Sweeten Works\" width=\"288\" height=\"52\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-27034 size-chrono\" title=\"engineered wood flooring\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"hardwood flooring\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Above) Throughout Tom and Alex&#8217;s apartment, <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/mid-century-mad-men-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">engineered wood<\/a> replaced old parquet floors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Customize the look<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Each species of wood has its own color and grain, and the choice is yours. Appearance has expanded beyond classic wood species and stains to include colored washes and dramatic textures added during manufacturing, from classic satin to wire-brushed to scraped. These distressed effects also serve to hide some wear over time as well as enhance character. Dimensions vary, too, from traditional narrow strips to wide planks that lend a rustic mood and also means\u00a0fewer seams into the overall floor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">The hardness of the wood should be taken into account, too. If your floor will see a lot of action, you want one of the harder species, like oak, maple, or hickory. The ranking system for hardness among different species, called the Janka hardness test, measures how a wood stands up to dents and wear. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Finishes affect the overall style, with a range of high, medium, or low gloss available from most manufacturers, depending on whether you want a highly polished or a more satiny effect. The finish, applied in anywhere from three to seven coats, should include aluminum oxide to make it resistant to the abrasions of daily foot traffic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Click-lock versus tongue-and-groove<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Edge treatments vary widely to give you plenty of options to achieve the look you want, from square to beveled to scraped to pillowed. Wood floors connect one edge to another by means of two methods:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Like the term implies, click-lock boards click into place to provide an almost seamless appearance, except for the grain of the wood. Found in engineered wood flooring, these require no adhesive and so the installation tends to go faster.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">The tongue-and-groove method fits together using a thin piece on one long side that fits into the grooved indenture on the adjoining board\u2019s side. Planks are further secured when nailed, glued, or laid in a floating installation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28816\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02-1-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-02\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/>(Above) Dark walnut <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hardwood flooring<\/a> in Jonathan and Cecilia&#8217;s home adds richness and a sense of depth to their space.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Get real with solid hardwood<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/wood-flooring-cost-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solid hardwood<\/a>\u00a0comes either factory-finished or can be finished on site. Factory-finished flooring arrives needing only to be installed, making it clean and quick to lay down. This method eliminates or reduces the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">The curing that site-finished wood requires (which can take up to two months as the wood adjusts to your home\u2019s climate)<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Dust from sanding<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Chemical fumes from the finish<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Length of time from start of installation to complete drying of finish<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Length of time to final use of room<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">The finish is also cured under UV lights at the factory, a process that can\u2019t happen on site, so the factory-finish is likely tougher than the one applied on site. This floor should also include a warranty from the manufacturer instead of the installer. The main benefit\u00a0of having a site-finished floor is if you desire total control over the final look. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Factory-finished floors typically arrive already topped with several layers of a water- or oil-based polyurethane coating that incorporates aluminum oxide to protect the wood from scratches and fading due to sunlight. A clear top coat provides the glossy or satin appearance. This floor can be refinished several times until the multilayer coating is completely removed, which then means reapplying the finish or, in extreme situations, replacing the plank. If your floor is finished on site, discuss with the installer what type of finish he recommends, and if it includes aluminum oxide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Caution: Solid wood is a natural material, making it vulnerable to swings in temperature and humidity. Because it will expand and contract, it must be fastened to a subfloor but not concrete, so it can\u2019t go below-grade or in damp areas like a basement or a bath that gets lots of steam.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28813 size-chrono\" title=\"engineered wood floor\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg\" alt=\"hardwood flooring\" width=\"723\" height=\"482\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" \/><\/a>(Above) <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Engineered wood<\/a> finished with a natural veneer pairs well with exposed brick\u00a0in Miguel&#8217;s\u00a0bedroom.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Fool the eye with engineered wood<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">If it looks like it\u2019s real wood, that\u2019s because it is\u2014a veneer of real wood atop a structural base, typically plywood. The base gives it added stability so it can go in a bath or a basement, as well as over radiant heating elements. It requires fewer trees than solid hardwood, but the base includes glues that bind the plywood and the veneer. This option is easy to install as a floating floor or it can be secured with staples or glue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Expect to find all the classic species of woods and stains in this engineered wood category, as well as some fun fashion colors like a gray wash. You\u2019ll discover a range of quality, too, so when shopping, investigate the thickness of the veneer, the number of protective coatings, and the number of ply in the base, which can range from three to seven and up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Refinishing engineered wood is far more limited than solid wood\u2014as little as once, depending on the thickness of the veneer. Buy an extra box in the event you need to replace a plank, so you don\u2019t have to worry about matching. Ask about warranties for both the finish and veneer delamination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Go authentic with reclaimed wood<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Probably the most environmentally-friendly choice, reclaimed wood that is salvaged from old buildings requires no cutting of trees. Its unique appeal comes from its original sourcing, which may be domestic woods that are now rare or unavailable for residential use. Like a vintage wine, reclaimed wood also shows a character that can\u2019t be reproduced today, even from advanced\u00a0manufacturing techniques. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">This wood is typically sourced from old factories, deconstructed homes, old decking or piers, but it still has to be treated to go into its new home. It may be warped or cracked in areas, and so require some milling before it\u2019s ready for installation. Make sure the wood is kiln-dried after milling, as this will aid its stability and also eliminate the possibility of critters, such as termites. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">This category can be found from a few national dealers, like Mountain Lumber, or locally by doing a search online, but if you shop from an independent dealer, make sure he or she guarantees the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Consider maintenance and repair <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">The biggest enemy of your wood floor is nearly invisible grit tracked in on shoes. Place area rugs or mats at entry points to catch dirt. Try to sweep or vacuum daily, clean monthly with a wood floor cleaner recommended by the manufacturer, so\u00a0you can enjoy your floor for a lifetime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to renovating your kitchen, find out\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/product-101\/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to choose the best kitchen floor for your family<\/a>, and learn about options ranging from hardwood to tile, and everything in-between.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/referral\/friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Refer your renovating friends to Sweeten<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s2\">\u00a0and you\u2019ll both receive a $250 Visa gift card when they sign a contract with a Sweeten general contractor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
