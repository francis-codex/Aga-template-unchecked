The first step on that journey is to estimate costs to expect for your Phoenix renovation project.<\/p>\n<p>Sweeten offers this Phoenix renovation cost guide as a jumping-off point to help start your project. It gives you a general idea of what major renovations costs to plan for; from the kitchen to bathroom to outdoor hardscaping.<\/p>\n<p>The keyword, though, is <em>general<\/em>. Every home is unique, and every homeowner differs in their tastes, so no two budgets will be the same. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection\u2014 for free.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick overview of costs for some standard renovation projects in Phoenix:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gut renovation: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$75<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$100<\/strong> per square foot (psf)<\/li>\n<li>Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$30,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$45,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$50,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$10,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$15,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000<\/strong> or <strong>$570<\/strong> psf.<\/li>\n<li>High-end bathroom remodel and extension: Starting at <strong>$40,000<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Adding hardscaping\/pavers: Starts at <strong>$30<\/strong> psf<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Phoenix home renovation costs per square foot<\/h3>\n<p>A total gut renovation in Phoenix (bringing your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking,) starts at <strong>$75<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$100<\/strong> psf for a home with budget finishes. This means installing materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependent on the scope of work and existing conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once\u2014 this saves money and is more efficient.&nbsp; You\u2019ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room.<\/p>\n<h3>How much a Phoenix kitchen remodel costs per square foot<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A budget kitchen in Phoenix will typically start at <strong>$15,000<\/strong>. To achieve this price, a rip-and-replace will keep the layout the same\u2014oven, sink, dishwasher\u2014to avoid the added cost of new plumbing and gas lines. You should also look for prefabricated cabinets, and shop for value appliances, tiles, countertops, and faucets at big box stores.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For a mid-grade kitchen in Phoenix, expect the starting costs to be between <strong>$25,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$30,000<\/strong>. According to <em>Remodeling<\/em>&#8216;s Cost vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/mountain\/phoenix-az\/\">report<\/a>, the average mid-grade project comes in at around <strong>$65,000<\/strong>. More than half of that \u201460 percent\u2014is a return on investment adding to your home\u2019s value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a kitchen at this budget, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with semi-custom cabinets, a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet, and shop around for a budget quartz countertop. You could also <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">add a kitchen island<\/a>, but the layout of anything involving a pipe or electrical wire will need to stay the same to keep costs down.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A high-end kitchen renovation starts between <strong>$45,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$50,000<\/strong> while, according to the Cost Vs Value report, the average budget renovation comes in at over <strong>$132,000<\/strong>. Over 60 percent of that is added to your home\u2019s value. At this level, you can go for the big-ticket item of custom cabinetry (which could take up half that budget!) You can also consider high-grade stone countertops, a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, imported tiles, designer faucets, and a built-in water filtration system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-48186 mb-48\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/GRAPH-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/GRAPH-3-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/GRAPH-3-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/GRAPH-3-1-600x426.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>How much a Phoenix bathroom remodel costs per square foot<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A budget bathroom in Phoenix typically costs between <strong>$10,000<\/strong>\u2014<strong>$15,000<\/strong>. Like kitchens, the best way to achieve a value budget is by keeping the layout the same. Plumbing fixtures remain in the same location. Limit your <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">use of tiles to the floor<\/a> and to part of the wall (rather than from floor to ceiling). Shopping for your materials at big box stores will also keep your budget low.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A mid-grade bathroom costs around <strong>$20,000<\/strong> or <strong>$570<\/strong> psf for something around the 35 square foot mark, according to the Cost Vs Value report. You could purchase a porcelain-on-steel bathtub and ceramic tiles. There\u2019s also the option of a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. Changes to the layout or plumbing will add to the budget. A project like this will add close to <strong>$14,000, <\/strong>or almost 70 percent of the budget to your home\u2019s value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect a high-end bathroom to start at <strong>$40,000<\/strong>. The average budget for a high-end bathroom comes in around <strong>$63,000<\/strong> for Phoenix or <strong>$630<\/strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodeling.hw.net\/cost-vs-value\/2020\/mountain\/phoenix-az\/\">report<\/a>. That includes an expansion from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The new bathroom can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. You can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Hardscaping for the outdoors<\/h3>\n<p>Phoenix is a great outdoor city in the fall, winter, and spring. With a few bells and whistles\u2014like misters, fans, and shade\u2014summer outdoor living is possible too. Adding or renovating hardscaping such as patio floors, retaining walls, and pavers starting at <strong>$30<\/strong> psf.<\/p>\n<h3>Permit costs in Phoenix<\/h3>\n<p>Different counties and towns around Phoenix have different fee schedules. Fees are often calculated by the total cost of the project or the size (square footage).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gilacountyaz.gov\/2020Building\/FEESCHEDULE%2012-2019.pdf\">Fees<\/a> in Gila County are tied to the cost of the project. For example, a project with a budget of <strong>$60,000<\/strong> will cost a little over <strong>$700<\/strong> in permitting fees. A project that is <strong>$20,000<\/strong> will cost about <strong>$320<\/strong> in fees. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits each start at <strong>$25<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In Maricopa County, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maricopa.gov\/DocumentCenter\/View\/6576\/List-of-Initial-Fees-by-Permit-Type-PDF?bidId=\">fees<\/a> for additions or alterations start at <strong>$110<\/strong>. If your project involves electrical, plumbing, or mechanical then it will attract at least another <strong>$60<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4>Ready to plan your own renovation in Phoenix?<\/h4>\n<p>Enjoy making your Phoenix home your own.
