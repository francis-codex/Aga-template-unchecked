We dragged our two kids to a 1920s two-family house, originally a boarding house, which we gave an initial surge of renovations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fast forward years later, we were really struggling with only one bathroom in the upper unit where we spent most of our time.\u00a0 Dave and I knew the time had come for an attic remodel on our third floor. It was a quirky, converted attic space of approximately 700 square feet, which contained our three main bedrooms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"staircase-to-front-porch\" class=\"wp-image-43893 mb-10 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg\" alt=\"exterior of house with vinyl siding and staircase and porch with railings after renovation \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-Exterior-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-Exterior-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-Exterior-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Fixing a general contractor dead-end<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Informed by local recommendations, we contacted four architects and a few major general contractors. Unfortunately, communication was disjointed, estimates were wildly different, and we kept hitting dead-ends. I was also weary of having contractors\u2019 preference for discussing things with my husband, instead of me, the project\u2019s decision-maker. This whole project was turning into a major headache, and we were discouraged.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg\" alt=\"Attic bedrooms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43894\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-4.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-4-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-4-600x386.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Enter Sweeten. A fellow MOP (Mom of Pelham) and Sweeten&#8217;s former CMO, Randi MacColl, had posted one of Sweeten\u2019s recent projects on Facebook. I messaged her with my saga. We were stressed we hadn\u2019t found an architect and then a contractor to execute the plans. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Randi\u2019s patience with my vent was amazing, and her solution was even better. Sweeten\u2019s team literally addressed every frustration we had been facing with this third-floor renovation project. They immediately walked me through setting up a profile to be <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">matched with vetted contractors<\/a> and supported the entire \u201cdating\u201d process to bring life to our vision of the space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>The wishlist for an attic remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That vision was complicated. Space was tight. Storage was minimal. We dreamed of having a master bath in our bedroom. The current bathroom was a crawlspace but the plan was to envelop Dave\u2019s closet to maximize the square footage for a full bath. We requested contractors through Sweeten for just the bath project. In our minds, however, we hoped for so much more\u2014new floors, built-ins, millwork, etc. My husband\u2019s wish list included dealing with a perpetual leak, insulating cold spots, reinforcing weak floorboards, and new windows. And little did I know that he was thinking about exposing the dry-walled chimney.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg\" alt=\"Attic bedrooms in Pelham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-5.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-5-300x209.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-5-600x418.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it. Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We met with a very manageable list of contractor\/architect pairs and got bids. In the end, we chose our Sweeten contractor because of his <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/reno-101\/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enthusiasm, experience, innovation<\/a>, and forthrightness in what he knew and did not know. The project quickly evolved from a single bathroom addition to a full-scale attic remodel, inside and out. A reworked floor plan also accommodated two new doorways. Our contractor suggested innovative built-ins in the master bedroom and the stairwell to maximize our floor space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Managing a challenging attic remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hiccups and crises along the way were numerous (as with any renovation to an old house), but both Sweeten and our contractor supported us through each stressor with patience and transparency. A big uncertainty was whether we could fit a bathroom with adequate height clearance that was compliant with building codes. They also had to work with an angled ceiling and what was behind it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg\" alt=\"Attic master bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg\" alt=\"master bedroom storage with slanted ceiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-MasterBedroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fortunately, our Sweeten contractor was all over this. A huge skylight helped to create the appearance of height in the space. We installed a custom medicine cabinet with a sloped recessed cabinet, a sink console with an expertly trimmed corner, and sconces from the U.K. to accommodate the hip wall. (I now know more about hip and valley rafters than certain diseases.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We faced another problem with sprinklers, which were required for any third-floor living space renovation. Cost estimates ranged from the manageable to the exorbitant. Our start date was pushed two months late, but our contractors put together a timeline for completion that seemed doable considering we were still living in the space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During the renovation, we moved to the first-floor apartment for six weeks, after which Dave and the kids left for the summer. Adding to the chaos, I was working in the ICU for a lot of the renovation period. Thank goodness for a dependable contractor and Sweeten for doing check-ins when I did not have the bandwidth to deal with anything non-clinical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Kusum-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1502\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45003 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Kusum-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Kusum-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/SWEETEN-Kusum-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-bathroom-3.jpg\" alt=\"Walk in shower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1502\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43891 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Renovation advice from Kusum and Dan<\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Reflecting on the project, I offer the following recommendations to other homeowners: a) set clear expectations of each person\u2019s roles, timelines, and constraints; b) establish a mutually agreed upon vehicle\/format of communication and a minimum frequency of contact\u2014endless email threads are the worst; c) hire your own cleaning team, as your standards of cleanliness (especially with young kids) may be much more stringent than the contractors; and d) personality match between the contractor and the homeowner is important to make a project successful and enjoyable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg\" alt=\"Attic bedroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43901\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-sonBedroom-7.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-sonBedroom-7-600x426.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>Family comforts for a top-floor attic remodel<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, the third floor has turned into a coveted space for our family.

My son&#8217;s elevated bed allows for plenty of storage bins underneath. My daughter has the perfect tween transition room, including a desk, privacy, and a creative space. We got a zen master bedroom and an entrance to our \u201cown\u201d bath.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As I stated earlier, the project started with a much more limited scope, but because of code regulations requiring the sprinkler system and the decision to splurge for a significant amount of millwork, we went over budget. We made this decision to do so without pressure because of our Sweeten contractor\u2019s transparency and strong communication. Both Dave and I were able to get all of the items on our wish list!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg\" alt=\"after of stairway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1438\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-43896 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-6.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-6-209x300.jpg 209w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Kusum-hallway-6-600x863.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This essentially makes this major renovation project #6 for us as a family.
