She occupied the top-floor apartment while her sister and her family lived below. As co-owners of the 2,700-square-foot home, the siblings wanted to renovate but would do it slowly in parts based on their budget. However, Sally had decided to move out so her apartment was bumped to the top of their renovation list. The space would be updated to attract renters. They <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/107182#after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted their kitchen renovation project<\/a> on Sweeten and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7019#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hired their Sweeten general contractor.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>They decided to tackle the most popular space in any home: the kitchen. People are naturally drawn to a kitchen and love spending time there with family and friends. So Sally knew that upgrading her existing outdated kitchen would make the whole apartment more enticing to renters. She wanted to open up the area to make it appear larger and add more storage. She knew this would also increase the functionality of the space.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-kitchen-cabinets-and-white-floor-tiles\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg\" alt=\"Beige kitchen closed cabinets over white tile flooring before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Before-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Before-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Before-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"light-gray-kitchen-with-gray-backplash\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg\" alt=\"Light gray kitchen with gray backsplash along with closed cabinet and stainless steel appliances after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51650\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/107182-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The design would be simple\u2014and create a space that was easy to maintain. She consulted with her contractor on materials that would keep her within her budget. The contractor removed a half-wall that was in between the kitchen and living space, added plumbing, and removed unnecessary beams. The space is now completely open. Aesthetically speaking, gray was the deciding color palette for the cabinetry, appliances, and backsplash. The result is a neutral, contemporary kitchen that is pleasing to all tastes and styles.<\/p>\n<h4>Sally&#8217;s Sweeten contractor goes above and beyond<\/h4>\n<p>Sally relied heavily on her Sweeten contractor throughout the process.

Their 934-square-foot condo in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was water damaged. They needed to fix it\u2014and quickly. \u201cWe were very concerned about drying out the place, getting the demolition completed, and covering the \u2018basics,\u2019\u201d said Jesse. They interviewed a half-dozen contractors on their own. The couple also <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/37029#after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">posted their project<\/a> on Sweeten and a helpful assist with comparing all of the estimates led to the decision <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/4985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to hire this Sweeten contractor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Jesse and Malik lived in the apartment for 10 years before the water damage so they wanted to take advantage of some improvements. And not just rip and replace what was originally there. For the bathroom, they added a pocket door, which was helpful to make the best use of the space. A niche was created for storage. For the shower, half of a wall was removed and a hand shower was added. The final result was a mix of contemporary forms with convenient functionalities.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"beige-bathroom-with-bathroom-vanity\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Before-02.jpg\" alt=\"Beige bathroom with bathroom vanity and bathtub before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"small-white-bathroom-with-glass-separator\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Bathroom.jpg\" alt=\"Small white bathroom with glass separator for walk-in shower and bathroom vanity with mirror after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51642\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Bathroom.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Bathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Bathroom-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>A bold and dramatic kitchen transformation<\/h4>\n<p>The look for the kitchen would be decidedly contemporary. Inspired by a photo of a kitchen with a matte black palette, the couple set out to put their own spin on it. Adding to the dramatic palette, a quartzite slab countertop from Brazil had some delays but was well worth the wait. \u201cThe stone really brings so much movement to the space,\u201d said Jesse.<\/p>\n<p>Despite eye-catching countertops, the cabinets were not overshadowed. The couple hired a millworker\u2014recommended by their Sweeten contractor\u2014who made custom cabinets. The best part? They are maple plywood with a \u201ctraceless\u201d ultra-matte finish, which translates to fewer fingerprints. And perhaps the couple&#8217;s favorite feature of the kitchen is the waterfall peninsula. \u201cIt\u2019s a great finishing touch,\u201d said Jesse.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"black-kitchen-cabinets-with-kitchen-island\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg\" alt=\"Black kitchen cabinets with kitchen island and recessed light fixtures after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51645\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/37029-Jesse-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Jesse and Malik found their Sweeten contractor to be a flexible partner <span class=\"s1\">throughout the process, offering useful feedback and working through the issues when they came up. <\/span>\u201cHe understood from the start that we had a certain vision for the outcome,\u201d said Jesse. \u201cAnd he steered us to ensure we wouldn\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d The couple just loves that their new space \u201csuits us and our style.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Renovation Materials<\/h4>\n<p>KITCHEN RESOURCES: Wilsonart Traceless Ultra Matte laminate and maple plywood cabinetry in Midnight Velvet: Custom by contractor.

When he bought his 720-square-foot condo located in the River North section of Chicago, he knew it needed repair. But after a year of living with the outdated bathroom, he decided it was time to pull the trigger on a renovation and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/projects\/108977#after\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post his project<\/a> on Sweeten.<\/p>\n<p>Jonathan <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6168#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hired a Sweeten general contractor<\/a> in his area and the work began. At first, Jonathan only intended to rip out the bathtub and replace it with a standing shower. However, his friends convinced him otherwise. They suggested that since he hired a contractor, he might as well replace more than just the tub. Jonathan agreed and decided to give the bathroom an added refresh by upgrading the tiles in the shower wall and floor as well.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"small-brown-and-white-bathroom\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Before.jpg\" alt=\"Small brown and white bathroom with bathtub and bathroom vanity with granite countertop before renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51409\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Before.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Before-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/108977-Jonathan-Santiago-Bath-blog-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom shower with gray oversized tile and rainhead shower head\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-52088 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/108977-Jonathan-Santiago-Bath-blog-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/108977-Jonathan-Santiago-Bath-blog-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/108977-Jonathan-Santiago-Bath-blog-2-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"honeycomb-or-hexagon-shower-floor-tiles\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Bath-06.jpg\" alt=\"walk-in shower with honeycomb or hexagon floor tiles and glass wall after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51664\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Bath-06.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Bath-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/108977-Jonathan-Bath-06-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>A subtle but satisfying change<\/h4>\n<p>Jonathan&#8217;s biggest question he needed advice on: What do I need to buy? For this, he turned to his general contractor who guided him on each of the materials he would need and the quantity.<\/p>\n<p>The change was not drastic but it was one that satisfied Jonathan\u2019s wish: to have an open shower look with only a glass divide\u2014no door, no tub. The tiles on the shower wall are large-format, which visually expands a space. They are typically chosen for their modern vibe and clean aesthetic. To add texture and pattern, a gray hexagonal mosaic for the shower floor was brought into the mix. Mosaic tiles are not only pleasing to the eye but serve a functional purpose. Small tiles require more grout creating a non-slip surface.<\/p>\n<p>Jonathan is happy with the way the project turned out. \u201cI love that I can walk in my shower,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cAnd it looks pretty!\u201d It has gotten him thinking about future renovations. \u201cI still have a few more projects in the pipeline!\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Renovation Materials<\/h4>\n<p>BATHROOM RESOURCES: Hexagon Marble Art floor tile mosaic and ceramic wall tile in Concrete Gray and Selah White: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flooranddecor.com\/\">Floor &amp; D\u00e9cor<\/a>.\u00a0 HarJue rain showerhead: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a>.
