Popularized by the all-white kitchen farmhouse look, painted Shaker cabinets in colors like blue, green, and gray are now commanding attention in kitchen remodels.

And why, are they so popular?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shaker cabinets were developed by the Shakers, a group derived from the English Quakers and Methodists. They emigrated to New York state from England in 1774. Their communities grew throughout New England and westward in Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Part of their beliefs included simplicity and order. Working with their hands led them to become entrepreneurs and craftspeople. They earned a reputation for high-quality furniture building, among other skills. From this, the Shaker-style cabinet was born.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Laura-kitchen-13.jpg\" alt=\"light green galley kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-43873\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Laura-kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Laura-kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Laura-kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Renovation with mint Shaker-style cabinets by <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-renovations\/kitchen-patio-house-extension\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten homeowners Laura + Tim<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are Shaker-style cabinets?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">A Shaker-style cabinet door is a simple, five-panel door. It is made of a flat frame with squared edges using cope-and-stick, or stile-and-rail, construction. It has a flat, non-ornate, recessed inner panel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The design of Shaker cabinets is reflective of their makers. Quality craftsmanship followed Shaker&#8217;s beliefs in simplicity and order, and so did the design of the cabinet door itself. <\/span><span class=\"s3\">Form followed fun<\/span><span class=\"s1\">c<span class=\"s3\">tion<\/span> since the utility was important. As such, Shaker-style furniture, including cabinets, served a purpose and avoided embellishment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why are Shaker-style cabinets so popular?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cabinets are a big-ticket item in a kitchen. As styles change, it is much less expensive to swap out accessories, or even countertops, for an easy update. The Shaker cabinet\u2019s simple style makes it pair well with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-materials-101\/kitchen-backsplash-materials-for-your-kitchen-remodel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">various backsplash designs<\/a>, flooring types, and countertop materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shaker cabinet doors are easy to produce, strong, and durable. Without ornate decoration, they are also easy to clean. Because of their simplicity and minimalistic style, Shaker cabinets have proven to be versatile and enduring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shaker communities were most populous in the mid-1800s when their membership peaked at about 6,000. In 2017, only two living Shaker members remained. But their furniture style continues to influence American design today.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg\" alt=\"White and blue modern kitchen with little girl sitting on the quartz countertop after renovation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/102497-Brandi-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #76808f;\">(<em>Above<\/em>) Renovation with navy and white Shaker cabinets by <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/sweeten-renovations\/kitchen-remodel-rockville-md-for-a-multigenerational-family\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sweeten homeowners Brandi + Chris<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What home styles do Shaker-style cabinets complement?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Because Shaker cabinets have such a precise historical origin, you might think that they belong in a specific home style.
