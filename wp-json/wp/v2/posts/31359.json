Then he picked up everything for her since, she said, \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker and don\u2019t have a car!\u201d She also found it helpful to contact Sweeten\u2019s client services, which answered her questions and directed her to their partner Build.com, where she purchased most of her fixtures.
