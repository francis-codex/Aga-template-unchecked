Here, Colonial, Federal, and Victorian styles are among the many that enrich the residential landscape. While many exteriors tend to be well-preserved, interiors commonly need to be updated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten<\/a> offers an outline on what to know before starting older home renovations in Boston (plus, which rooms get the most bang for the buck!)\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and financial protection\u2014at no cost to the homeowner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Upgrading electrical in Boston homes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What makes us comfortable in our homes? What will most improve the layout and\/or function? Before you start with the obvious, consider what\u2019s not visible, but is still very impactful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">No matter what the scope of your remodeling is\u2014the whole house or just a kitchen and\/or baths\u2014electrical service may need a boost. One 100 amp circuit box may not be enough. For a 2,000-square-foot home, 200 amps are optimal. It\u2019s better to go bigger, allowing for add-ons in the future, since it\u2019s more cost-effective. A professional electrical audit helps determine what needs upgrading (like adding GCFIs where there is water, in kitchens, baths, laundry rooms, for example).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Older home renovation &#8220;Must&#8221;: Bring the HVAC up to speed<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on the age of the heating and cooling systems, you may want to replace units for more efficiency. Newer systems have been designed to work better. Sizing is calculated according to square footage; sometimes two or more furnaces and air conditioners are needed. Make sure ducts are insulated. Zoning spaces also is smart, so that you can shut down areas of the house that may not be used all the time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Note that AC units manufactured before 2010 contain Freon. That R-22 material has been banned by the EPA (as of this year) because it\u2019s ozone-depleting. It\u2019s still available, but much more costly. Eventually, those air conditioners will need to be retrofitted for a new refrigerant or replaced as supplies run out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hot water heaters generally have a shelf life of seven years. If you need to replace one, consider high-efficiency tankless heaters. They supply hot water on demand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Improve window efficiency<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even the best HVAC system won\u2019t work optimally if you have leaky windows. Single-pane glass common in older homes often is a source of heat loss. Consider replacing windows with Energy Star-qualified ones. Options include all-wood, vinyl, aluminum-clad with wood inside, and fiberglass.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Features to look for:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2022 Low-E, or Low-Emissivity, with metallic coatings that allow windows to reflect rather than absorb heat<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2022 Double or triple panes<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2022 Gas-filled (argon or krypton gas) between glazed layers to improve heat insulation and slow heat transfer<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Allow for contingencies<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe try to work within a budget,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/7012#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Jeff<\/a> who is based in Boston. But once you open everything up, he says, there may be structural work beneath a ceiling. Or fixing a slant on a floor. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI recommend allowing at least 10 percent extra,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boston-based <a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/members\/6941#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sweeten general contractor Peter<\/a>, for example, talks about problems inherent to Boston buildings 200 to 300 years old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA lot of structures in Downtown, South End, Back Bay neighborhoods, sit on wood piles. There\u2019s a regulation many don\u2019t know. When you renovate, you have to put in rainwater discharge to maintain water level. That\u2019s so the piles don\u2019t rot when the wood gets exposed to oxygen.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How to preserve the best elements of your older Boston home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One blessing of older homes is inheriting original features. Hardwood floors, crown moldings, and wood built-ins add warmth and character. If the materials are generally in good shape, it\u2019s best to restore. Even if repairs are in order, costs usually are far less than replacement. Lifting up wall-to-wall carpeting may reveal intact hardwood. Sand out tack holes and refinish the floors. Yellowed boards can also be fixed with sanding. Stain, or leave the floors natural, topped with non-yellowing polyurethane. And relocating a built-in can save thousands of dollars. It&#8217;s possible, for example, to repurpose a kitchen cabinet as a linen closet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make a master plan<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you\u2019ve brought electrical and mechanicals up-to-date, you\u2019re ready to dive into room remodels. Create a wish list in order of your &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves.&#8221; Sweeten gets you started with a renovation cost guide <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/cost-guides\/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-boston\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">for the interiors in Boston here<\/a>. <span class=\"s2\">One way to keep the costs down is to maintain the existing floor plan. <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Add about 10 percent more to your final budget for contingencies. Don\u2019t forget to factor in the cost of permits and dumpsters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The kitchen: the hub of the historic (and modern) home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For most, remodeling the kitchen is the biggest game-changer. It\u2019s at the core of today\u2019s living\u2014no matter what your lifestyle. For those who love entertaining, it\u2019s even more pivotal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The price tag for a kitchen remodel, of course, is affected by <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/gallery\/reno-notebook\/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">materials and appliance choices<\/a>. You may want to splurge on a dual fuel range and choose a more modest dishwasher or refrigerator. Once you start comparing prices, you can play the balancing act. Decide what\u2019s most important for your lifestyle. Ultimately, there are a few key kitchen renovations you can do (on a budget!) for an older home in Boston.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>Choosing appliances<\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Communication is critical, particularly in kitchen re-design. Contractor Jeff says that always involves prioritizing. \u201cI am honest,\u201d he says, about helping to choose appliances.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s about balancing the budget.\u201d So he might discourage a very high end brand refrigerator, especially if resale is an ultimate goal. \u201cYou won\u2019t get your money back if you\u2019re going to sell,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>Cabinetry and countertops<\/h5>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The choice of countertop and cabinetry materials can reduce line item cots. \u201cYou can go to a lesser expensive quartz,\u201d\u00a0 says contractor Peter. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of frameless off-the-shelf cabinets that look nice. These might even have soft-close features. These days, many prefer clean cut, straight lines.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If the cabinets are in good shape, they may be candidates for a new stain or paint. Replacing the fronts with simple shaker-style wood panels is an easy facelift. New hardware also can raise the style quotient. For some, storage may be an issue. Reconfiguring interiors with slide-out shelves or adding deep drawers for cookware are one answer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding or extending an island also may improve its efficiency. The additional surface extends prep and eating space. Then, you can build in more storage below it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>Keeping or moving plumbing<\/h5>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">In a minimal remodel, it\u2019s more cost-efficient to keep the plumbing in place. Re-piping or relocating pipes for remodeling adds between $5,400 and $7,000 (based on 1,500 square feet). Amping up the supply line from the main sewer to your home will assure a good flow of water throughout the home. If your water pressure needs help, ask your contractor whether a booster might work. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Obviously, an overall kitchen and bath plan for plumbing is ideal. Also be sure plumbers check for lead in pipes, valves, or faucets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Create a functional layout for your older home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Floor plans in older homes may not work for today. Some are too small or have chopped up rooms.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">An addition may not be in your budget, but it may be possible to borrow space. Look at closets, small rooms, hallways, even a sunroom or porch. There may be enough space for a breakfast room. Creating a new layout may even net a family or a bedroom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A powder room on the first floor is a must-have today. It also can provide a canvas for instant style. Since it doesn\u2019t require a large footprint, you probably can find the square footage. Some have even tucked powder rooms under back stairs. Without a shower or tub, a powder room is less expensive than a bath. So you might feel more comfortable splurging on some materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Refreshing a master bath<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A spa bath may be on your wish list but not in your budget. Still, there\u2019s a lot you can do to get a more modern look. Replace the fixtures. Get a new vanity. Install light sconces as well as an overhead chandelier. You can give it all a luxury look with porcelain tile instead of marble or limestone. There are so many stone lookalikes at a fraction of the cost. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">A mid-range bath remodel recoups close to 59 percent of the job cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cTry to create as much space as you can,\u201d says Sweeten contractor Peter. \u201cA tub takes up a lot of space. We often install showers instead.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Both Sweeten contractors say that rain showers are high on Bostonians\u2019 lists, and there\u2019s a large enough price range to suit most budgets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Even modest renovations to an older Boston home can be transformative! You&#8217;ll certainly realize there\u2019s an upside: the more you live in your home, the more you\u2019ll see its full potential with future renovation projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Doing renovations to an older home\u2014in Boston or beyond\u2014is crucial for <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/how-to-protect-your-home-before-winter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protecting it from the winter cold<\/a> from pipes and roof to masonry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
