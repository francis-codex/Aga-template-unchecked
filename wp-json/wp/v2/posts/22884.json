One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet\u2013about 24 inches\u2013which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1640064887893\">\r\n<p><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen<\/u><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>\u2014<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\"><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, scope, and style.
