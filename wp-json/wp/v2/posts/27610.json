The timeframe depends on complexity, the size of your space, and scope.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if you are 1) not altering the footprint, 2) not changing or adding electrical or plumbing, and 3) using stock cabinetry and appliances, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that your renovation will be done in a few weeks. If, however, you are moving your kitchen from one part of your home to another, requiring both city permits as well as board approvals, and using imported custom cabinets\u2014you should give it several months. The wide range is due to the fact that there can be many moving parts and multiple parties involved. Certain aspects may be beyond your control. Sweeten\u00a0breaks down a kitchen renovation step-by-step.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/how-we-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vetted general contractors<\/a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments\u2014for free.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<h3>PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASE<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, a lot\u00a0needs to happen before picking up that sledgehammer. Here, the details on each box that needs to be ticked before you break ground on the project.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are a significant number of homeowners who are in contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. The best advice is to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wait until you have closed on the property<\/a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you\u2019re in a hurry\u2014at least wait until you\u2019ve signed the contract before beginning the design process.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 2: Post your project (1-3 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First things first:\u00a0Post your project to Sweeten and begin soliciting bids. On the Sweeten site, add some details about the space you want to renovate. Inspiration photos are optional but useful for us to find you contractors who have done similar styles. Include any other information that would help Sweeten match you with the right contractors. You&#8217;ll receive 3-5 matches with links to check out contractors&#8217; profiles online. Read reviews from clients and photos of their past projects to see whether they might be a good fit.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Decide which contractors you\u2019d like to set up a meeting with and <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/process-and-planning\/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prepare for an on-site visit<\/a>. An in-person visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and the limitations of the space. You&#8217;ll also see if personalities and communication styles mesh. You should expect a written bid within 5-7 business days after your visit.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-40132 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05.jpg\" alt=\"kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" data-overlay-text=\"\" data-overlay-color=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-600x401.jpg 600w, https:\/\/sweeten.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>(<em>Above<\/em>) Katherine + Chris&#8217;\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/before-after\/entire-homes\/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen renovation<\/a><\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once all the written bids have come in, it\u2019s time to compare and contrast! This\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">primer<\/a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with Sweeten to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 5: Sign a contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you\u2019ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an outline of the costs, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of all the steps where hiccups or delays might occur, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and necessary approvals have held up many a renovation, but don\u2019t be daunted. Sweeten contractors are well-versed in navigating these processes and often can advise you on how to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you\u2019re moving plumbing or gas lines, you\u2019ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks\u2014but it\u2019s more common for it to take a couple months.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you live in a stand-alone house, you won\u2019t need to worry about building board approvals. However, you\u2019ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure everything is up to code.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don\u2019t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what\u2019s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be a good neighbor and alert them. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It\u2019s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there\u2019s an end in sight! It doesn\u2019t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!<\/p>\r\n<h3>CONSTRUCTION PHASE<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Note: While most of the steps under \u201cConstruction\u201d are your contractor\u2019s responsibility, it\u2019s important to understand what should be happening and when. It is vital to make the scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract) so the project can keep moving forward. Also, keep your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 9: It\u2019s demo time (1-2 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out with the old! Now that you\u2019re done with the paperwork, it\u2019s time (for your contractor) to pick up that sledgehammer. Items that are staying should be protected with tarp or plastic. Depending on how large your kitchen is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn\u2019t take more than a day or two.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (1-4 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the space stripped down to the studs, new plumbing or electrical can be placed where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans need to be altered now that you can see what\u2019s behind the walls.<\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1 hour on-site)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you needed city permits, inspections and a final sign-off may be needed before the walls are closed up, particularly with gas lines. <span class=\"s1\">While it may take the inspector an hour to do his job at the site, scheduling the actual appointment could take days or weeks.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A master plumber is typically allowed to sign off on pipework for water lines if the city inspector doesn&#8217;t show up. However, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project before this inspection happens.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete. They will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. Sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 12: Installation &#8211; floors (1-5 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Make sure the flooring you choose is consistent throughout the room, even if they\u2019re hidden. If you decide in the future to reconfigure the cabinet layout, the floors won\u2019t need to be redone.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 13: Installation &#8211; all other material\u00a0including cabinets and appliances (1-10 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Installation of all other materials is usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware.\u00a0Aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions, and the arrival time of the materials.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Typically, contracts allow that the space is left in a \u201cbroom-swept\u201d condition. However, you may want to <a href=\"https:\/\/sweeten.com\/renovation-101\/process-guides\/clean-up-after-major-renovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hire post-construction cleaning specialists<\/a> to ensure it is cleaned to your specifications.<\/p>\r\n<h3>POST-CONSTRUCTION PHASE<\/h3>\r\n<h3>STEP 15: Final walk-through with your contractor (30-60 minutes)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point them out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it\u2019s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, advises to keep notepads in each space, and not speak to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)<\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Punch list items can be issues from straightening a cabinet door to waiting on installing that last out-of-stock item. Completing the punch list can take anywhere from a day to several weeks. When it\u2019s on the long side, though, that is usually due to items being back-ordered. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.<\/p>\r\n<h3>STEP 17:\u00a0The final payment (10 minutes)<\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the last item on your punch list has been addressed, the remaining payment is paid to your contractor and the project is complete.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This timeline is meant to give you a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and typical time ranges. Factors that may be outside of both your and the contractor\u2019s control should be taken into account. In general, Sweeten renovators report that their kitchen renovations are completed between three weeks to two months (depending on the level of complexity). The key to staying on track is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles and allotting more time to get them done.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you\u2019re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/app.sweeten.com\/journey\/124884#intention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">renovate with the best contractors<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><i>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project\u2019s location, budget, and scope, helping until project completion.
