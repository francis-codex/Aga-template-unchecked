			<h2>203(k) loans come with strings attached. Understand how they work, and when they can<span>—and can&#8217;t—be used.</span></h2>

<p>In addition to cash, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, many homeowners pay for their renovations with Federal Housing Administration 203(k) loans.</p>
<h3>How do 203(k) loans work?</h3>
<p>These federal loans come with strings attached: they can only pay for specific categories of work, they release funds in two lump payments, and they often require the client to hire a HUD consultant. They pay a maximum of $35,000.</p>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans can be used to:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Improve a home’s functionality or attractiveness</li>
<li>Eliminate health and safety hazards</li>
<li>Rehab the plumbing or sewer systems</li>
<li>Install or repair the roof, gutters, and downspouts</li>
<li>Install or replace the flooring</li>
<li class="li1">Improve major aspects of the landscaping<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ensure accessibility for a disabled person<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make a home more energy-efficient<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans<span class="s1"> can’t be used to:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make structural repairs or improvements<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Work on a rental property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new construction / room additions<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new swimming pools<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build tennis courts, gazebos, or bathhouses<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build other “luxury items”<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Payment schedule</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FHA will pay the homeowner a partial sum when the 203(k) loan is approved, and the remainder at the conclusion of the project, typically after all required inspections. You won’t be able to negotiate for payments in-between these official ones.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to handle 203(k) loans</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, decide if you’re willing to accept them at all. You’ll get more work if you do, but you’ll have to be ok with the payment schedule, and possibly additional paperwork. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether you choose to accept 203(k) loans or not, bring up the topic early in discussions with a potential client, before submitting an estimate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the client plans to use a 203(k) loan, this will put hard constraints on the project scope, the budget, and the payment schedule. You’ll have to figure all of this out before you draft the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You absolutely don’t want to have a signed contract in hand, and then hear, “By the way, we’re paying with a 203(k)!”</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication is key to a happy client, a good review, and building goodwill</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes a job a success? A happy client—and ideally, a great review and great portfolio pictures, to help you win more jobs. Sweeten outlines how to aim for that happy client and glowing review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Think about your end game at the beginning</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">When negotiating your contract, ask for permission to shoot “after” pictures.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Be 100% clear about the punch list and schedule. Don’t leave room for misaligned expectations.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Define “completion” in the contract. Be explicit. If you promise to leave the space “broom clean,” explain clearly what this means. If the client would like you to hand over the space in more pristine condition, this is the time to negotiate.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate—and reduce—the client’s stress level</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Remember that the client probably hasn’t done this before, and doesn’t know what to expect. Tell them clearly about your process and what they’ll experience.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any delays, any days when no one will be working at the site, any problems.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any damage—even if you plan to fix it right away. You don’t want them visiting the site and getting upset because they discovered some spilled paint!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that permits might remain open for several weeks after completion and that this is normal.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask for a review</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ideally ask at a late milestone, like when reviewing the punch list<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask in person, and make it clear that it means a lot to you<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Follow up </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Check in with the client a month or so after completion<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Thank them for the review (or ask them again if they’d consider leaving one)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask how they feel about the work, now that they’ve had a chance to live with it (Chances are high that they’ll be happy, and you’ll just be building good will. If the client has complaints, this is your chance to fix them.)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Check-in with Sweeten</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Debrief your account manager on the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Are you especially proud of this project? Ask if Sweeten will consider it for the blog.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate what you’ll want at the end of the project, and start working toward it as early as possible. Anticipate your clients’ concerns, and start taking care of them as early as possible. These are the secrets to success! </span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Why be a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you’re ambitious and have experience in the construction industry, general contracting offers a unique career path from a worker to a business owner. Interested? We hope you’ll find Sweeten&#8217;s following guide helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What is a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A general contractor is a person (and company) that coordinates and supervises construction projects, including renovations. This includes securing required permits, and hiring, scheduling, and overseeing all the subcontractors (masons, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In most areas, general contractors are required to be licensed, and to carry worker’s compensation insurance, as well as specialized liability for construction. The general contractor is financially responsible for any injuries or property damage at the job site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Are there different kinds of general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yes. Contracting companies can offer a range of services. Some are “build-only” firms, which only work from drawings provided by the client. Others are full-service “design-build” firms, which will have designers and possibly even architects on staff. And there’s a spectrum between these extremes, including firms that can offer advice on materials and finishes, and firms that make architect referrals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There’s also a range of firm sizes. Some are sole-proprietorships or 2-person partnerships. Others have many employees, including front office staff. As you’d expect, most general contracting firms start small and grow over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What does Sweeten look for in general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten expects professionalism, great communication skills, an outstanding portfolio, and the following objective qualifications:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">All required general contractor licensing for your service area</span></li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A certificate of insurance for General Liability coverage</span></p>
</li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A business registered under the same name for at least 6 months&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Who can become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The field is open to anyone; there are no specific physical or educational requirements. However, your chances of success will be greatest if you have experience in the construction industry. This can include a construction trade, design, project management, estimating, or property management.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Be aware that the job is mostly about management and running a business. Your knowledge, administrative skills, and people skills will be more important than your ability to swing a hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How to become a general contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There are two common paths to take. Each can prepare you to get licensed and registered, so you to can take on jobs that require hiring subcontractors:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for yourself in your trade (as a carpenter, plumber etc.)</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for another company, and work up to a supervisory role&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What’s the worst way to become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Start out as a designer, and hire subcontractors to complete projects—even though you don’t have a general contracting license or construction insurance. Unfortunately, this is common, and is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How do I become licensed?</span></h3>

The first is to work for yourself in a chosen trade, like a carpenter, plumber, etc. The second way is to work for another company and work up to a supervisory role; overseeing a team of subcontractors who specialize in multiple fields. Depending on the state you live in, you may also need to become licensed and registered with the state.</p> </div> </div>

<p class="p2">Sweeten knows that as a general contractor, you handle multiple jobs simultaneously—you sometimes bend your schedule to accommodate delivery delays, permit snags, sick subcontractors, and whatever else tomorrow brings.</p>
<p class="p2">But your client probably doesn’t know any of this. Here are our tips for setting expectations—the key to happy clients and great reviews.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Be upfront and transparent about how you work</h3>
<p class="p2">Explain early that you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crews working on multiple jobs</a>, and that it’s normal, say, for the electrician to run off to work on a different project. And that it’s normal for there to be hours—or even days—when there are no workers on site. Explain that some work may have to wait for materials to be delivered, or for adhesives to dry.</p>
<p class="p2">Make it clear that circumstances often force schedule changes. Then let clients know ASAP any time there’s a delay or if work has to pause. An informed client is a happier client.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Be patient and open-minded during client conversations</h3>
<p class="p2">Remember that your client has probably never done this before. Questions that could seem insulting often just come from a lack of understanding about construction, or anxieties about their home being jackhammered. Please don’t take these questions personally! Answer as patiently and clearly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Emerging Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">If <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-general-contractors-does-sweeten-work-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’re new to Sweeten</a>, you might feel tempted to bend over backward to make clients happy. We’ve seen GCs perform work outside of scope without creating a change order, etc.  Please don’t go crazy—you’re a business, and you need to treat clients as clients.</p>
<p class="p2">Stepping outside the bounds of the contractor-client relationship can lose money for you, and can create false expectations. Clients who think you’re a friend doing them a favor can feel betrayed when you start acting like a business!</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Established Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">Be patient and clear when explaining why you can’t comply with a request. If it’s a technical or a code restraint, the client will be much more satisfied if they understand. Don’t let them think you’re just inflexible. You might be able to work together to find a compromise.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Remember your Sweeten Account Manager</h3>
<p class="p2">If you’re having trouble communicating something to a client, talk to us! We can always jump in and help.</p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s how to make your company stand out from the competition—and get paid what you’re worth</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="sage-green-yellow-shower-wall-tiles"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51003" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with sage green square tiles on two walls and yellow tile on an other wall and black shower fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs just build, others run full-service design-build firms with architects and interior designers on staff, while the rest fall somewhere in between. If you can communicate exactly what you offer, you’ll be able to use design and materials services as selling points—and get paid fairly for them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider your unique offerings. For your clients, do you&#8230;</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make recommendations on materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curate and present a shortlist of materials options?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Introduce them to trusted vendors and arrange for trade discounts?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Take them shopping for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Play any role in ordering, paying, receiving, storing, QCing, or handling logistics for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Create 3D renderings or visualizations?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Design or fabricate anything for a custom installation?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you do any of the above, remember that this is real work—and it adds value for your clients. You should get paid a fair price for it! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communicate and educate</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with many aspects of renovating, the first step to success is communication. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Educate your clients</a> as early and clearly as possible. Many homeowners are new to renovation and do not realize that these services exist, or that they have real value. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You never want to lose a job because you’ve been outbid by another contractor who doesn’t offer the services the client needs. You’ll miss the business, and the homeowner will discover the cost of making uninformed choices—possibly when a pallet of materials they don’t like or don’t have space for lands at their front door. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro Tips</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your offerings</b><br />
Think about all your design and materials services. Write them down and get comfortable explaining them.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your prices</b><br />
Calculate how much time you put into these services, and put a price on them. Set limits (e.g., “The bid includes spending up to 1 hour with you at the tile store. Time beyond that we’ll bill at $100/hr.”)<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Use your services as selling points</b><br />
Discuss your design and materials services when selling your firm to prospective clients. This will differentiate your company, and will allow you to bill a fair price for the work.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Discuss process along with value</b><br />
Make sure your clients <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-juggle-contracting-jobs-and-keep-clients-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know what to expect</a>. A client educated in your process will have realistic expectations. They’ll more likely trust your expertise, be easier to work with and be happy with the outcome.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have any questions about selling your design and materials services, call or email your Sweeten account manager any time. We’re here to help!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Adding your change order policy in a contract—while simply being upfront with the client—make a huge impact</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg" alt="Image of a room mid-construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors know that most renovation jobs and budgets get modified along the way. This happens either by last-minute client choices or by forces outside everyone’s control. But your clients may not know this—they’re probably not prepared for new expenses appearing after the job’s begun. </span><span class="s1">The solution: prepare clients by discussing change orders! Here, Sweeten offers 5 suggestions on how to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">1. Bring up change orders early </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Start the conversation during the hiring process. Don’t try to slip it in after they’ve signed the contract. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Have a clear and consistent change order policy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have to know every detail of your policy before you can discuss it with clients effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Communicate openly, honestly, and confidently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be afraid of scaring the client! They’re looking to you as the expert who will guide them through the process. Expert contractors will talk to their clients about <em>everything,</em> from <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation timelines</a> to change orders. By guiding them honestly and confidently, you’ll earn their trust. Plus, you’ll get to work with a well-informed client who has reasonable expectations.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Include your policy for change orders in the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This should be in addition to a discussion, not in place of it. Make sure you’re just as open and honest when you put your policies in writing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Be especially clear with clients who are purchasing their own materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impress upon them the significance of last-minute changes or delivery delays. Explain that what looks to them like a minor change in materials could actually mean hiring a more expensive subcontractor. And it may throw off the whole schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that most problems with clients come from broken expectations. The most valuable tool in your toolbox is good communication—it’s how you create trust and reasonable expectations before the work begins.</span></p>
