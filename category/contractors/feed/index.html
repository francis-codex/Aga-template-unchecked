			<h2>203(k) loans come with strings attached. Understand how they work, and when they can<span>—and can&#8217;t—be used.</span></h2>

<p>In addition to cash, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, many homeowners pay for their renovations with Federal Housing Administration 203(k) loans.</p>
<h3>How do 203(k) loans work?</h3>
<p>These federal loans come with strings attached: they can only pay for specific categories of work, they release funds in two lump payments, and they often require the client to hire a HUD consultant. They pay a maximum of $35,000.</p>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans can be used to:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Improve a home’s functionality or attractiveness</li>
<li>Eliminate health and safety hazards</li>
<li>Rehab the plumbing or sewer systems</li>
<li>Install or repair the roof, gutters, and downspouts</li>
<li>Install or replace the flooring</li>
<li class="li1">Improve major aspects of the landscaping<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ensure accessibility for a disabled person<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make a home more energy-efficient<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans<span class="s1"> can’t be used to:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make structural repairs or improvements<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Work on a rental property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new construction / room additions<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new swimming pools<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build tennis courts, gazebos, or bathhouses<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build other “luxury items”<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Payment schedule</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FHA will pay the homeowner a partial sum when the 203(k) loan is approved, and the remainder at the conclusion of the project, typically after all required inspections. You won’t be able to negotiate for payments in-between these official ones.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to handle 203(k) loans</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, decide if you’re willing to accept them at all. You’ll get more work if you do, but you’ll have to be ok with the payment schedule, and possibly additional paperwork. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether you choose to accept 203(k) loans or not, bring up the topic early in discussions with a potential client, before submitting an estimate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the client plans to use a 203(k) loan, this will put hard constraints on the project scope, the budget, and the payment schedule. You’ll have to figure all of this out before you draft the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You absolutely don’t want to have a signed contract in hand, and then hear, “By the way, we’re paying with a 203(k)!”</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication is key to a happy client, a good review, and building goodwill</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes a job a success? A happy client—and ideally, a great review and great portfolio pictures, to help you win more jobs. Sweeten outlines how to aim for that happy client and glowing review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Think about your end game at the beginning</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">When negotiating your contract, ask for permission to shoot “after” pictures.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Be 100% clear about the punch list and schedule. Don’t leave room for misaligned expectations.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Define “completion” in the contract. Be explicit. If you promise to leave the space “broom clean,” explain clearly what this means. If the client would like you to hand over the space in more pristine condition, this is the time to negotiate.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate—and reduce—the client’s stress level</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Remember that the client probably hasn’t done this before, and doesn’t know what to expect. Tell them clearly about your process and what they’ll experience.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any delays, any days when no one will be working at the site, any problems.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any damage—even if you plan to fix it right away. You don’t want them visiting the site and getting upset because they discovered some spilled paint!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that permits might remain open for several weeks after completion and that this is normal.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask for a review</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ideally ask at a late milestone, like when reviewing the punch list<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask in person, and make it clear that it means a lot to you<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Follow up </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Check in with the client a month or so after completion<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Thank them for the review (or ask them again if they’d consider leaving one)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask how they feel about the work, now that they’ve had a chance to live with it (Chances are high that they’ll be happy, and you’ll just be building good will. If the client has complaints, this is your chance to fix them.)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Check-in with Sweeten</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Debrief your account manager on the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Are you especially proud of this project? Ask if Sweeten will consider it for the blog.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate what you’ll want at the end of the project, and start working toward it as early as possible. Anticipate your clients’ concerns, and start taking care of them as early as possible. These are the secrets to success! </span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Why be a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you’re ambitious and have experience in the construction industry, general contracting offers a unique career path from a worker to a business owner. Interested? We hope you’ll find Sweeten&#8217;s following guide helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What is a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A general contractor is a person (and company) that coordinates and supervises construction projects, including renovations. This includes securing required permits, and hiring, scheduling, and overseeing all the subcontractors (masons, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In most areas, general contractors are required to be licensed, and to carry worker’s compensation insurance, as well as specialized liability for construction. The general contractor is financially responsible for any injuries or property damage at the job site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Are there different kinds of general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Yes. Contracting companies can offer a range of services. Some are “build-only” firms, which only work from drawings provided by the client. Others are full-service “design-build” firms, which will have designers and possibly even architects on staff. And there’s a spectrum between these extremes, including firms that can offer advice on materials and finishes, and firms that make architect referrals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There’s also a range of firm sizes. Some are sole-proprietorships or 2-person partnerships. Others have many employees, including front office staff. As you’d expect, most general contracting firms start small and grow over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What does Sweeten look for in general contractors?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten expects professionalism, great communication skills, an outstanding portfolio, and the following objective qualifications:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">All required general contractor licensing for your service area</span></li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A certificate of insurance for General Liability coverage</span></p>
</li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A business registered under the same name for at least 6 months&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Who can become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The field is open to anyone; there are no specific physical or educational requirements. However, your chances of success will be greatest if you have experience in the construction industry. This can include a construction trade, design, project management, estimating, or property management.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Be aware that the job is mostly about management and running a business. Your knowledge, administrative skills, and people skills will be more important than your ability to swing a hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How to become a general contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There are two common paths to take. Each can prepare you to get licensed and registered, so you to can take on jobs that require hiring subcontractors:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for yourself in your trade (as a carpenter, plumber etc.)</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Work for another company, and work up to a supervisory role&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">What’s the worst way to become a general contractor?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Start out as a designer, and hire subcontractors to complete projects—even though you don’t have a general contracting license or construction insurance. Unfortunately, this is common, and is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How do I become licensed?</span></h3>

Depending on the state you live in, you may also need to become licensed and registered with the state.</p> </div> </div>

<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="orange-living-room-during"  class="alignnone wp-image-50681 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg" alt="orange living room in the process of renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Sweeten knows that as a general contractor, you handle multiple jobs simultaneously—you sometimes bend your schedule to accommodate delivery delays, permit snags, sick subcontractors, and whatever else tomorrow brings.</p>
<p class="p2">But your client probably doesn’t know any of this. Here are our tips for setting expectations—the key to happy clients and great reviews.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Be upfront and transparent about how you work</h3>
<p class="p2">Explain early that you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crews working on multiple jobs</a>, and that it’s normal, say, for the electrician to run off to work on a different project. And that it’s normal for there to be hours—or even days—when there are no workers on site. Explain that some work may have to wait for materials to be delivered, or for adhesives to dry.</p>
<p class="p2">Make it clear that circumstances often force schedule changes. Then let clients know ASAP any time there’s a delay or if work has to pause. An informed client is a happier client.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Be patient and open-minded during client conversations</h3>
<p class="p2">Remember that your client has probably never done this before. Questions that could seem insulting often just come from a lack of understanding about construction, or anxieties about their home being jackhammered. Please don’t take these questions personally! Answer as patiently and clearly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Emerging Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">If <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-general-contractors-does-sweeten-work-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’re new to Sweeten</a>, you might feel tempted to bend over backward to make clients happy. We’ve seen GCs perform work outside of scope without creating a change order, etc.  Please don’t go crazy—you’re a business, and you need to treat clients as clients.</p>
<p class="p2">Stepping outside the bounds of the contractor-client relationship can lose money for you, and can create false expectations. Clients who think you’re a friend doing them a favor can feel betrayed when you start acting like a business!</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Established Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">Be patient and clear when explaining why you can’t comply with a request. If it’s a technical or a code restraint, the client will be much more satisfied if they understand. Don’t let them think you’re just inflexible. You might be able to work together to find a compromise.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Remember your Sweeten Account Manager</h3>
<p class="p2">If you’re having trouble communicating something to a client, talk to us! We can always jump in and help.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with an average of $80,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pay Only-When-You-Win business model</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You only pay us when you win a job. Sweeten doesn&#8217;t charge you to sign up with us, and we don’t charge you for leads. Our fee is a small percentage of the total contract value. Most contracting firms consider it a business development expense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is this important? We only get paid when you get paid. It doesn’t serve us to waste your time by sending you dozens of low-quality leads, or by sending the same leads to dozens of random contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten cares about your success—we consider you a partner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Highest Quality Projects</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We only send you legitimate, transformative renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-renovations-does-sweeten-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects that require multiple trades</a>. We won’t waste your time with single-trade jobs or handyman tasks. Our minimum budget is $15,000. Our average contract value is $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All leads we send you are vetted for readiness and appropriate budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Vetted Leads, Matched to You</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we send you a lead, it will match your geographic service area, the types of services you offer, and your preferred budget range. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Streamlined Competitive Bidding Process</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll compete with just 2 to 4 other contracting firms for each job. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">If you and the client express interest in each other, we give you tools to help with messaging, site visit scheduling, video site visits, and hiring. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">On the client side, we help them understand and compare estimates, to help them make the best choice—even if it’s not the lowest bid.</span><span class="s1"> </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We minimize the time you spend on unpaid work. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Services to Help Contractors Grow</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten also helps contractors by giving you a dedicated account manager to help with business development and marketing. They&#8217;ll also help make your Sweeten profile and portfolio as competitive as possible. We offer opportunities for free photography and social media promotion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We stand behind your work, by offering financial protection to your Sweeten clients. They’ll be able to hire you with confidence and peace of mind. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean Brownhill, Sweeten’s founder and a trained architect, started the company to bring support and guidance to general contractors. She also created SAW (Sweeten Accelerator for Women), a mission to advocate and promote skilled women contractors. The aim was to shift the current professional model and help bridge the gender gap for established and growing firms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average $67,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Jean offers a view into why she started SAW and the opportunities she sees for Sweeten to help women grow their construction businesses. </span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Women already in the contractor role</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have personally seen a lot of women go into interior design or architecture and work in these industries for many years. What I saw was that we were frequently doing the job of the general contractor: managing subcontractors, choosing materials, or coming up with construction details. It&#8217;s so obvious to me that women are already doing that work—and just not being compensated for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the <a href="https://www.sweeten-saw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reason why I started SAW—</a>and why I started Sweeten in general—because I believe that internet technology and the web allows for new access points. It allows for new opportunities. In the past,  a woman would have had an incredibly hard time becoming a general contractor, getting clients, or hiring the subcontractor networks they needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now there&#8217;s so much transparency and opportunity. Sweeten provides that job deal flow that can help a woman-led general contracting firm not only in its first few years of business but also as the company continues to grow. We are so excited to support that. </span></p>
<h3>Including daughters in the conversation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general contractor and the construction industry have long been dictated by nepotism and through union participation. Union participation is related to commercial work and we don&#8217;t typically do that type of project. In residential, however, it&#8217;s mostly through nepotism. Fathers would hand down their construction businesses to their sons—an intergenerational transfer. In some ways, Sweeten’s platform can help with the mentorship and tutelage to help women grow their businesses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conversations with our male general contractors, we have said, &#8220;Hey, you should think about giving this business to your daughter.&#8221; In fact, we have one in our network right now whose daughter went to architecture school. I said, &#8220;Your daughter should take over your business.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s so funny you&#8217;re saying that. I was just having that conversation and didn&#8217;t even think that she would want it.&#8221; And she does.</span></p>
<h3>Breaking the contractor stereotype</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the power of storytelling and our blog, we’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlighting the incredible projects</a> that our women general contractors have completed and are really changing the narrative around what the job is. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job of a general contractor—it is logistics, it is communication, it is delegation. You have to marshal labor and materials to a job site and orchestrate the labor and the materials to come together to finish a project. You do not need to swing a hammer. You do not need to be a burly guy. Whenever the image of a general contractor is, it is a false one. Those executive functioning skills, women are great at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all those reasons, it was clear to me that a program like SAW needed to exist. We’re so excited to be able to support these women general contractors. Hopefully, it will encourage more women to join the industry because they have the skillset for it. It&#8217;s a great profession and offers a path to small business ownership. The hours can be very flexible if you have children at home. </span></p>
<h3>Building a flow of work</h3>
<p>Our women general contractors do not have a problem with getting hired by homeowners. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is when women need to secure additional subcontractor labor and get them to work on their projects. Subcontractors still have a very outdated idea about who a general contractor is. The good news is that if there is a steady deal flow and steady work, money does talk. They can break that up really quick.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg" alt="Tom Raber Contractor Fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this second of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gets advice from Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>, on what stats to focus on, what he tells his coaching groups to initiate change, and how to sell for a higher profit. You can also hear more on his podcasts. <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-do-i-grow-my-general-contracting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read Part 1</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important stats for contractors when they’re looking to grow their business? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First off, don’t be intimidated by the numbers—it is just scorekeeping. Think of it like fantasy football stats &#8211; you need to run the plays that get the most yardage. Using data will help you make better decisions. Like fantasy football or baseball, work on your “stats” weekly and be objective. How many times did the phone ring? Where did your leads come from? What was the size of the job? How much did you spend to get that lead? What is the close rate of all the leads from that source, how many closed?</span></p>
<p>The numbers tell you where to focus. Don’t shy away from them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>Note:</em> Tom discusses more about stats on <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">his podcast.</span></a> You can also <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">monitor how your business is doing</span></a> when you are part of the Sweeten network.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the top three things you encourage GCs to start doing when they join your program?</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s1">1. Engage with a like-minded community</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may sound remedial but, first and foremost, I encourage general contractors to join our online community. The first step is to get engaged—don’t be a wallflower. It is like joining a gym, and then not going—that won’t get you any closer to your goals. Get in, ask questions, engage, be present. This is a like-minded community, so share your story and listen to the stories of others. If you follow the system, it will work for you. </span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">2. Define the first problem</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get clarity around the very first issue you want to fix. You need to define that first problem. Focus on one issue and go all-in on that. Use the frameworks provided to double down and knock down that first domino. You have to dedicate time and energy to the problem, which means you won’t be able to fix everything at once.</span></p>
<h4>3. Focus on your first problem every day</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you have defined that first domino, build consistent habits around tackling that problem, so it always stays top of mind. Then create a checklist of three things and do it every day. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important things to do when looking to start selling jobs with a higher profit? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a hard look at your numbers</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">First off, you need to give yourself a reality check (via the job-costing exercise). At least 75% of general contractors do not know or understand their own numbers. In my program, when we take them through their numbers, it is an eye-opening experience. It&#8217;s possible to sell jobs with a 50% profit. It doesn&#8217;t sound possible but it can be done.</span></p>
<h4>Sharpen your communication skills</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get your sales process in order. How you communicate with a prospective client makes a huge difference. Most contractors think it is about the scope of work or price, but it is absolutely about human connection and understanding the homeowner’s motives. Practice by role-playing with the online community. Oh, and listen when people talk; don’t just think about what you plan to say next!</span></p>
<h4>How to build trust with clients</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, “mind the gap”—this is the time between the sale and the work being done. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t go silent:</strong><span class="s3"> Continue to add value during this time by educating them so they feel great about their decision to hire you. This builds trust and makes it a great experience.  </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Do what you say you will when you promise to do it:</strong><span class="s3"> Being trustworthy and having integrity is critical to this business and being able to charge higher prices. </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t blame customers for being cheap: </strong><span class="s3">Ask yourself first “have I done everything I can to make sure this customer feels heard?”</span><span class="s1"><i><br />
</i></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this first of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> talks with Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>. Tom explains how to start job-costing, discussing profit and overhead with clients, and common issues that general contractors are facing within his coaching groups. You can also check out <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/category/the-contractor-fight-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his podcast</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking. It may seem remedial, but that is where most people need to start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Want to know how to close projects? Establish trust with your clients and explain your estimate.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49345" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg" alt="booking renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GCFacing-BookJob-2-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Success depends on that one signature. In this guide, Sweeten shares key tips to how to smooth the process to close projects and getting signed contracts. These practices will reduce time and effort for you while reducing anxiety for the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Establish a process and communicate it early</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re the pro—it’s up to <em>you</em> to know everything you’ll need from the client, and when you’ll need it. Having an established process will help you show confidence and authority, which earns confidence from clients. You may find it helpful to map out the process in writing, even if those notes are just for your own use.</span></p>
<p>If you sense you’re getting positive feedback from the client, you can start discussing next steps as early as the site visit. At the latest, you’ll want to start these discussions when you deliver your estimate.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Communicate clearly and transparently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be shy about discussing your process with the homeowner. Most clients, especially first-time renovators, will be comforted by a confident contractor who leads them through the process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs avoid bringing up critical steps, like contracts and payment plans, out of fear that this will scare the homeowner away. Don’t fall into this trap! It’s always better to be upfront. Your transparency inspires confidence and will help you avoid springing surprises on the homeowner at the last minute. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Consider these points:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Are you asking for a large payment upfront? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If yes, explain why—for example, to order materials early and avoid delays, to secure your crew, etc. Conversely, if your payment schedule is flexible or you are asking for a relatively low percentage upfront, use that as a selling point.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Will you take care of permits? If so, which ones? Will there be any costs associated with this work? </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Be sure to clearly communicate what will be on the homeowner’s plate to manage and pay for versus what you are providing as value-added services.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Encourage questions! </span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Homeowners appreciate the opportunity to learn from you and a healthy dialogue gives you the chance to demonstrate your expertise and listening skills. An informed client is a good client.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Some questions to be prepared for:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can you revise the estimate (itemizing, reorganizing, taking things out, or adding additional line items in, etc.)?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Be sure to set boundaries. Let the client know how many revisions you&#8217;re willing to make.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Is the estimate negotiable?<br />
</i></span><span class="s5">Emphasize that you&#8217;ll work with them on revising their project scope to fit the budget. Set limits on how much time you&#8217;ll invest for free without a commitment.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><i></i><span class="s3"><i>Can I get a discount?<br />
</i></span><span class="s1">Here it&#8217;s usually best to stand behind your work, and emphasize that you&#8217;ve already made your bid as competitive as possible. But make sure this is the truth! It&#8217;s always best to start with a competitive bid than with a high or low estimate or other sales gimmick. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Explain the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you send the contract, let the homeowner know what to expect beforehand.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Will you send a digital contract or paper one? </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li><span class="s3"><em>Pro Tip: Most clients prefer digital documentation. Use Sweeten&#8217;s e-signature feature to get contracts signed faster. </em></span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Tell the homeowner that you’re comfortable with answering their questions about your contract.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you use a standard boilerplate contract, send it with your estimate—don’t wait for the client to beg!</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">If you include your contract with the estimate, be sure to remind the client that it’s there.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Always include a time limit in your contract— &#8220;This estimate is good for 60 days,&#8221; etc. Make sure the client understands this. This speeds the process along, and protects you from a client showing up years later expecting the same deal.</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1">Knowing how to close projects with clients takes practice and care. <span class="s1">Always think about what you can do to inspire confidence and trust. Taking the lead, being open and honest, transparent in your communications, and clearly explaining your contract will all help you win the client’s trust—and win the job.</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s how to make your company stand out from the competition—and get paid what you’re worth</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="sage-green-yellow-shower-wall-tiles"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51003" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with sage green square tiles on two walls and yellow tile on an other wall and black shower fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some GCs just build, others run full-service design-build firms with architects and interior designers on staff, while the rest fall somewhere in between. If you can communicate exactly what you offer, you’ll be able to use design and materials services as selling points—and get paid fairly for them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider your unique offerings. For your clients, do you&#8230;</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make recommendations on materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Curate and present a shortlist of materials options?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Introduce them to trusted vendors and arrange for trade discounts?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Take them shopping for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Play any role in ordering, paying, receiving, storing, QCing, or handling logistics for materials?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Create 3D renderings or visualizations?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Design or fabricate anything for a custom installation?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you do any of the above, remember that this is real work—and it adds value for your clients. You should get paid a fair price for it! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communicate and educate</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As with many aspects of renovating, the first step to success is communication. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Educate your clients</a> as early and clearly as possible. Many homeowners are new to renovation and do not realize that these services exist, or that they have real value. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You never want to lose a job because you’ve been outbid by another contractor who doesn’t offer the services the client needs. You’ll miss the business, and the homeowner will discover the cost of making uninformed choices—possibly when a pallet of materials they don’t like or don’t have space for lands at their front door. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro Tips</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your offerings</b><br />
Think about all your design and materials services. Write them down and get comfortable explaining them.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Establish your prices</b><br />
Calculate how much time you put into these services, and put a price on them. Set limits (e.g., “The bid includes spending up to 1 hour with you at the tile store. Time beyond that we’ll bill at $100/hr.”)<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Use your services as selling points</b><br />
Discuss your design and materials services when selling your firm to prospective clients. This will differentiate your company, and will allow you to bill a fair price for the work.<br />
</span></li>
<li><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Discuss process along with value</b><br />
Make sure your clients <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-juggle-contracting-jobs-and-keep-clients-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know what to expect</a>. A client educated in your process will have realistic expectations. They’ll more likely trust your expertise, be easier to work with and be happy with the outcome.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have any questions about selling your design and materials services, call or email your Sweeten account manager any time. We’re here to help!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Adding your change order policy in a contract—while simply being upfront with the client—make a huge impact</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50333 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg" alt="Image of a room mid-construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GC-Cover_Change-orders-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General contractors know that most renovation jobs and budgets get modified along the way. This happens either by last-minute client choices or by forces outside everyone’s control. But your clients may not know this—they’re probably not prepared for new expenses appearing after the job’s begun. </span><span class="s1">The solution: prepare clients by discussing change orders! Here, Sweeten offers 5 suggestions on how to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">1. Bring up change orders early </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Start the conversation during the hiring process. Don’t try to slip it in after they’ve signed the contract. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Have a clear and consistent change order policy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have to know every detail of your policy before you can discuss it with clients effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Communicate openly, honestly, and confidently</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t be afraid of scaring the client! They’re looking to you as the expert who will guide them through the process. Expert contractors will talk to their clients about <em>everything,</em> from <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation timelines</a> to change orders. By guiding them honestly and confidently, you’ll earn their trust. Plus, you’ll get to work with a well-informed client who has reasonable expectations.  </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Include your policy for change orders in the contract</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This should be in addition to a discussion, not in place of it. Make sure you’re just as open and honest when you put your policies in writing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Be especially clear with clients who are purchasing their own materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impress upon them the significance of last-minute changes or delivery delays. Explain that what looks to them like a minor change in materials could actually mean hiring a more expensive subcontractor. And it may throw off the whole schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember that most problems with clients come from broken expectations. The most valuable tool in your toolbox is good communication—it’s how you create trust and reasonable expectations before the work begins.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wide range of general contracting firms work with Sweeten—just about anyone with a proven record of excellent home renovations in one of our service areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few ways we look at different types of general contractors and contracting firms, and the benefits Sweeten offers each of them.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Size of the General Contracting Firm</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Emerging firms </b></span><span class="s1">are typically small firms that are still working to establish their presence and build a renovation portfolio. Sweeten works with general contracting firms that have been in business for at least six months. In addition to the Sweeten resources that help other small firms, emerging firms benefit from Sweeten’s free project photography, and our $15K minimum budget. Both help you build your portfolio and move from handyman tasks to the kinds of jobs you want. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Small established firms, </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with five or fewer employees, include sole proprietorships and family-run teams. These firms, while small, have specializations and are looking for specific types of projects. You may have limited resources for <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/lead-generation-for-contractors-to-generate-business-and-turn-a-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing and finding new, appropriate leads</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten offers services to help small, but established firms grow and thrive. These include a dedicated account manager, who will feel like a new team member devoted to marketing and business development. Equally important is Sweeten’s strict vetting of all leads, to make sure you’ll waste less time chasing jobs that go nowhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Large and established firms</b>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with over five employees, typically devote more resources to managing work volume. Sweeten offers large, established firms a full-featured <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard to track leads and projects</a>. Multiple team members can be given access to the dashboard. You’ll have full control over lead flow—pausing your account, restarting it, opening up to a wider variety of job types or budgets to land some quick work, or narrowing your focus to slow the flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also benefit from our high project values (2020 average was $67,000), and our lead vetting—we protect your time and resources from clients with the wrong kinds of jobs, or unrealistic budget expectations.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Types of General Contracting Firms</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Build-only firms</b> work from plans drawn by an outside designer or architect, or they handle basic rip-and-replace jobs. When Sweeten qualifies a project, we ask what kinds of services the client needs. We’ll give you all the important information, including if they’re already working with a designer or architect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Design-build firms</b> offer full design services, either by having designers or architects on staff or by having a partnership with outside professionals. When Sweeten determines that a client will need your full services, we prepare them for the associated budget increase.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Everything in between</b>. We work with general contracting firms that offer a wide range of design services, from basic advice on fixtures and finishes to making architect/designer referrals. We will learn your about services and your job preferences and will send you the most appropriate leads with appropriate budgets.   </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketing Capacity</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms with a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you an even greater exposure, with opportunities for features on our blog and in the press (<em>Architectural Digest</em>, <em>The Today Show</em>, and other major outlets) which would otherwise be out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Firms without a dedicated marketing team.</b> Sweeten offers you a free start—you get all the marketing benefits of the platform, and only pay when you win a job. And you’ll get the benefits of all our pre-qualified leads, along with our sophisticated digital ad campaigns that target only the right homeowners.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What kind of firm is yours? How can Sweeten help you win?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you have questions for our account managers about becoming a Sweeten GC, <a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schedule a call</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit—meeting a potential client over video—can help you keep the project moving safely during COVID-19 </span></h2>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45300 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit.jpg" alt="virtual site visit using laptops" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is a virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit, simply, is a site visit conducted over video. It lets you safely review renovation projects while maintaining social distance with homeowners. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit helps you achieve two primary objectives:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Appraise site conditions and the project scope, so you can prepare a working estimate for the project.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Sell your firm’s qualifications. This means building rapport with the client, sharing your proposed ideas for the renovation, and highlighting your firm’s strengths and experience..<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">The two types of virtual site visit</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: this is most common, and makes sense if the client already lives in the space being renovated. They’ll be onsite, and will walk you though the space by video.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: this works if the client hasn’t yet moved into the space. You can go to the site and see it in person, while the client watches on video and directs you.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to prepare:</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s important to make a good first impression. Review the project information that’s been shared with you. Prepare questions for the clients about their project vision and what they’re looking for in a general contractor. This will help the conversation flow. Remember that this could be their first renovation; they won’t necessarily know all the questions that need addressing. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Video Technology</b></span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Confirm with the client that they can get a strong enough signal at the job site.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Agree on a backup plan, in case your video quality breaks down during the call. Will you move to a regular phone call? Or, if you think you can resolve the connection problems, will you reschedule a video call?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p6"><strong><span class="s1">The Sweeten Video tool:</span></strong></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">Sweeten&#8217;s in-platform video tool for virtual site visits makes it easy and organized to work with a potential client. It will run on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. No outside video apps or other downloads will be necessary. Save time on dealing with Android/iPhone compatibility issues. </span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">All parties will receive a link to the video meeting in an email.</span><span class="s4"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Your Sweeten account manager can give you a quick tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> If you use a third-party video app:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">You and the client must agree in advance on which video chat app to use.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Many clients favor Zoom or Facetime. If one or both parties use an Android device, you won’t be able to use Facetime.</span><span class="s6"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul3">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Zoom is free, but limits the calls to 40 minutes, unless you have a commercial account, and you host the call.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Download any necessary software ahead of time, and try using it with a colleague, friend, or family member beforehand. Familiarize yourself with the software’s functions and quirks.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Questions</b></span></h5>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">These should include:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">How quickly is the client looking to start the remodel?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What qualities or services are most important to the client in a contractor?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Will an architect, designer, or the homeowner be choosing the materials? Remind the homeowner that ordering and delivery of materials to arrive on time is critical for preventing delays.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Is the client planning to live in the space during the renovation?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What constraints are there on site access, work hours, parking, etc.?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The actual visit</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Successful virtual site visits usually have three parts: introduction, walkthrough, and discussion.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This your opportunity for a casual hello—a stand-in for a handshake. Let the client know you’re excited about the project. Share a little bit about yourself and your renovation experience. Agree on a backup plan, if there are video problems.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Virtual Renovation Site Walkthrough</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: the client will be on-site, while you watch on video remotely. Ask the client to show you the spaces that they’re planning to renovate. Have them walk through with the camera pointed away from them. As they move through the space, speak clearly; politely ask them to slow down, back up, turn left or right, point up or down. Take screenshots, or ask the clients to send photos of specific features in a followup email, if you think it will be helpful. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: you’ll visit the job site, while the client watches remotely. You can accomplish the same social distancing, with the added benefit that you can see the site firsthand and make actual measurements. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">With this method, some of the roles are reversed. You’ll be walking through the site, pointing your phone’s camera, while the client guides you from afar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is your time to shine, so talk up your experience! Offer to send examples of similar projects you have completed, so the client can see evidence of your abilities. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Spend plenty of time addressing the client’s concerns. Ask them to review the project with you. Ask all the questions necessary to ascertain the project scope. Cover all the other questions you’ve prepared. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Finally, be clear about your plans to follow up. Tell the client when they can expect to see your bid. Encourage them to follow up with any questions, and tell them the best channels for reaching you.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Followup, Estimate, Ongoing Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit will usually give you enough information to draw up a “best effort” estimate. If you need more information, contact the client as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Be sure to manage expectations. Make it clear that this initial estimate should be considered “commercially reasonable,” but may need to be updated once you’ve made in-person measurements or seen inside the walls. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">And be sure to stay in touch. This will be a new experience for most clients—probably an expensive, disruptive, and scary one. The best way to put them at ease is with clear communication. Ask them their preferred channels for updates, and make sure they always know what’s going on and what to expect.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How does a virtual site visit compare with a physical site visit?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re able to conduct a “contractor in the space” visit, to an uninhabited site, It should be just as effective. Communication is a bit more cumbersome, but you can see everything you need to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a “client in the space” visit, where you survey the site by video, you should be able to gather enough information to make an initial estimate. According to Long Island-based </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6806#overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor Robi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I truly believe a virtual site meeting for most projects will be enough to send an estimate for the labor cost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one item that is held up is the material selection process.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re a design-build firm and are assisting with design and materials</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “then even the design process can be done virtually in order to get the price of material selections.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077282363"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I get my deposit through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll send a deposit request, straight from your Sweeten dashboard. The client will get an alert to review the request. It’s just one step for them to approve payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077296728"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How long will it take to get paid?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll get notified immediately when your client has approved payment. This lets you know funds are on the way. Funds will be available in your bank account in 1–2 business days.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077312433"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are there any fees for using Secure Pay? What about credit card fees?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You pay no transaction fees, even on credit card payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077332269"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I know when the client has paid?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll get a notification by email when the client approves a payment. You’ll also see payment status on your deposits dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077357578"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How is this faster than a paper check or cash?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">&#8211; Clients can respond much more quickly to your deposit request—they pay digitally, right from their Sweeten dashboard, with a few clicks. In addition to convenience, Secure Pay offers them the confidence of a trusted 3rd party payment network. They’re less likely to hesitate.<br />&#8211; Payments through Secure Pay clear faster than a check, and don’t require mailing or in-person delivery. <br />&#8211; As far as cash, homeowners are unlikely to keep enough under their mattresses! No one likes the danger and inconvenience—and the lack of financial protections—of procuring and delivering thousands of dollars in cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077370721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay give me a competitive advantage?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">71% of homeowners on our platform have said that they’d prefer to be able to pay digitally, directly through Sweeten’s platform. 78% said they’d prefer to pay by credit card. You’ll get badges on your profile showing that you take Secure Pay for credit cards and ACH, which will distinguish you from firms that don’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077405447"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay build trust with clients?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Homeowners are often afraid that contractors will run off with their money. Paying through a trusted 3rd party fosters confidence and peace of mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077422125"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Can I use Secure Pay to receive all renovation payments?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Right now it’s only available for deposits, to get you hired and started as quickly as possible. But we’re working on making it available for all payments. Stay tuned!</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077439580"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Secure Pay create additional steps in my process?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll be paid directly by the client. Sweeten saves you the headache of having to open up an account with a payment processor, negotiating a rate with them, and paying a fee for each transaction. By being a part of the Sweeten network, you get access to this free service.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077456948"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Do I need to have a signed contract before requesting a deposit?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, for now—you’ll need to upload a signed contract to Sweeten before you have access to Secure Pay. In an upcoming release, we’ll allow you to request deposits earlier, so you’ll have the flexibility to use the deposit as part of the contract signing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077476640"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does this work with Quickbooks?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">As long as the bank account linked to Secure Pay is the same account linked to Quickbooks, you’ll see deposits come through as you would any other ACH payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077498635"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Why should I trust the safety and privacy of Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Payments are handled by our trusted 3rd-party banking partners, Stripe and Dwolla. These are leaders in the financial industry, with rock-solid reputations for privacy and data security. Your transactions and financial information are protected by the highest level of end-to-end encryption. Sweeten cannot see or store any of your financial information.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077515270"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Sweeten’s fee get deducted automatically?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Absolutely not! You’ll continue to receive a separate invoice that you can pay by ACH or credit card within 30 days.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Estimating overhead and profit are important parts of any project bid. However, underestimating overhead costs on a project often cuts into the profit. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how to manage the cost of your business within a renovation project estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h4>How does Sweeten work with general contractors?</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Contractors pay only when they win a project. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 1: Estimating Overhead</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Indirect overhead</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ongoing, or indirect, overhead items keep a business running long term.  There are a number of indirect or ongoing costs. These may include: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Salaries and benefits for employees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Office costs, such as rent, utilities, supplies<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vehicle costs<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Insurance<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Marketing costs, including Sweeten fees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Professional services including accountants, attorneys<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Software licenses<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of these expenses as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; as they allow you to get in the game and operate a successful business. For that reason, many general contractors spread these costs evenly over a number of projects by incorporating them into their overhead and categorizing them as marketing. Others build it into their overhead on a project to project basis. It’s a key decision a contractor needs to make when they’re running their business. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a personal decision! The important point is to treat these fees as business expenses, and not as a reduction in profit. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead costs are costs for specific projects. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Equipment rental<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Job site utilities<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Additional insurance, when required<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Manpower for non-labor charges, such as accepting deliveries and ordering materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Project marketing expenses</span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">For example, the fees for Sweeten’s services provide </span><span class="s4">business development and marketing, opportunities for free photography/blog and social media promotion, peace of mind, and consumer protections for clients that are designed to help our GCs win.</span><span class="s3"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Include anything that does not fall under materials or labor that affects the project.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 2: </span><span class="s1">Presenting P and O Estimates</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some contractors lump profit and overhead costs together. However, separating the two offers an opportunity for the contractor. Most clients don&#8217;t understand the expenses of running a business. Many people assume the profit and overhead number is mostly profit—and they will try to get the GC to reduce it. Separate the two, and it could lead to a better understanding of what is behind the estimate. It explains the cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One helpful strategy is to list some of the overhead items that benefit the client.  They will appreciate the transparency and help them understand what they’re paying for. Offering this could separate the contractor from other firms bidding on the project. The client should know if the GC will purchase more insurance or special equipment to make the project successful. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 3: </span><span class="s1">Estimating Profits</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many GC&#8217;s use a standard profit percentage for their renovation project estimates. </span><span class="s4">It is a fairly common practice for GCs to increase or decrease the percentage based on different job factors. A contractor might reduce their profit margins if it looks like the project will run very smoothly. Perhaps a client already has materials on-site, so changes or delays due to delivery issues are unlikely. Some of Sweeten&#8217;s GCs will give a small discount on profit to lock in the job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the reverse is also true! Projects that appear more difficult for some reason. For example, projects where the clients have a difficult time making decisions and you anticipate delays.  Those types might include a higher profit margin in the bid. This will give you a cushion to fall back on when problems crop up. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 4: </span><span class="s1">Change Orders and Options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes happen on many projects. Account for your cost by including profit and overhead items in the change order procedure. Above all, be sure to be upfront with this practice in the initial contract you sign with the client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same is true if options, or add-ons, are included in the estimate. Include the profit and overhead in the renovation project estimate for the add-on. In those cases, the profit and overhead are combined with the estimated costs. </span></p>
<h5>Beat the competition with fair, profitable renovation project estimates</h5>
<p>We hope our guide to adding profit and overhead costs to your renovation project estimates was helpful! Knowing how to do this strategically is a crucial step in growing your contracting business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How personal referrals, social media marketing, and typical lead-gen services stack up against working with Sweeten</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48001" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image.jpg" alt="Sweeten vs competitors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweetenTeam-image-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve got many options for finding leads. Each demands investing time and energy, and often cash. How do you choose? Of course, we&#8217;re biased—we’re pretty sure Sweeten is the best option for high-quality remodeling contractors. But it’s more than a casual opinion: we&#8217;ve sharing data to show how working with Sweeten benefits contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with a 2020 average over $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s why we think you’ll agree:</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Sweeten does the most thorough job of vetting leads. </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We weed out single-trade jobs and handyman tasks. We make sure the client’s budget fits the project scope. You tell us what kinds of jobs you want—your service area, your preferred project types, your budget range. We’ll only send you the right kinds of jobs. We only accept projects with budgets higher than $15,000 with rare exceptions. Our average job value for 2020 was $67,000. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We protect you from wasting time chasing dead-end leads. You won’t get this level of vetting from word-of-mouth referrals. You won’t get it from self-marketing on social media. You’ll get some of it from some lead-gen services—but you won’t get it all from any one of them.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. With Sweeten, leads are free—you pay only when you win a job.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want you to win—because we only get paid when you get paid. We will never waste your time by filling your inbox with inappropriate leads. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You won’t get a win-win arrangement like this from social media marketing. You’ll get it from a couple of lead-gen services. Keep in mind that with social media, you pay for each click, no matter what happens next. Most lead-gen services sell the same leads simultaneously to many contractors—they maximize their income while maximizing your competition. They’re invested in keeping you paying, but not invested in your success. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. With Sweeten, you’ll be part of an elite network of highly vetted general contractors.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homeowners will know you stand out from the crowd just by your Sweeten affiliation. They know that only 1 contractor out of 7 gets accepted into our network. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one else vouches for their contractors’ qualifications the way Sweeten does. All of our GCs have cleared a <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/"><span class="s2">multi-step vetting process</span></a> that includes license and insurance confirmation, portfolio reviews, a 30-minute live interview, and conversations with former clients. We tell our clients all about it! </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Sweeten offers you a true partnership. We’re in it long-term to help you grow.</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because of our win-win business model, we’re committed to your success.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We give you a dedicated account manager who helps with <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/the-renovation-sales-process-a-step-by-step-guide-for-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your marketing and business development</a> on the Sweeten platform. You’ll also have a dashboard that shows up-to-date performance statistics for your firm, offering valuable insights you can act on to win more jobs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Why we’re different:</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You won’t get any of this from referrals, social media marketing, or other lead-gen services. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47745 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sweeten wants general contractors who can do all of the construction work for every type of renovation project, right? Actually, wrong! While prior construction experience is great, many factors go into the process of hiring general contractors and adding them to the platform. Want to know what goes into vetting general contractors at Sweeten? Here, we outline the key factors <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> considers when vetting general contractors and approving them. (Plus, there&#8217;s a breakdown highlighting the difference between a general contractor and subcontractor!)</p>
<h3><b>What is a general contractor? </b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general contractor finds and manages experts to complete a construction project. Sometimes, the contractor themself may have background experience in construction. Or, the contractor may actually do some specialized work, like framing a room or doing tile work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kind of general contractor you&#8217;ll need depends on the type of project you’re doing! If you’re starting a ground-up project for a brand-new office building, you’ll need a contractor with experience in commercial construction or office buildings. If you were starting a luxury home bathroom project, you&#8217;d want a contractor who specializes in luxury bathrooms. (Luckily, Sweeten does this homework for you by expertly matching individual projects with the right type of contractor!)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>General contractor vs. subcontractor</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>General contractors</strong> organize experts from other trades and then bring them together to complete a project. For example, for a bathroom remodel, a general contractor would find experts in electrical, plumbing, and potentially painting work for the job.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Subcontractors</strong> are the experts specifically trained in a trade. In the bathroom remodel example, subcontractors would do the actual electrical, plumbing, or painting work. MEPs (Mechanical, electrical and plumbing) are the most frequently subcontracted trades, mainly because these trades are highly skilled and require special licenses or registrations. General Contractors may choose to subcontract out various trades depending on the scope of the project.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How does Sweeten choose general contractors? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten considers several factors when reviewing contractors: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That they have proof of insurance and licenses in Sweeten&#8217;s service areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photos of previous work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">References from previous projects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s online presence, from professional websites to reviews or social media business accounts </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication style </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of time in business (a minimum of 6 months)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have insurance?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors are required to carry insurance.</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a contractor is in a state that doesn’t require them to carry insurance, (Texas, for example,) Sweeten still requires that they get a certificate of insurance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Sweeten offers up to $50,000 in financial protection, that coverage is in addition to the separate insurance policy required of all Sweeten contractors. </span></li>
<li>The three most common types of insurance carried by contractors are general liability, workman&#8217;s compensation, and auto liability insurance.</li>
<li>Workman&#8217;s compensation is useful for projects that require a crew to be on site.</li>
<li>Auto liability insurance is useful for when a general contractor is parking on your property.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have licenses?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors carry licenses when available for residential renovation projects where they work. </strong></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that different states have different licensing requirements? It&#8217;s true! Fortunately, Sweeten checks licenses at both the state and/or county level. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Sweeten actively monitors the expiration dates of general contractor licenses. In fact, any general contractor with an expired license is not matched to new projects. This does two things:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensures Sweeten contractors are staying up-to-date with their licenses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevents Sweeten contractors from working on projects until their licenses are up-to-date</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What kinds of contractors work with Sweeten? </b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, Sweeten works with general contractor teams of all sizes! From single-person firms who subcontract out labor to contractors with dozens of employees on their payroll. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional trends also affect the size of firms. Some markets, like Los Angeles, tend to offer more one-stop-shop firms. This is compared to cities like Atlanta and Chicago, who have a wealth of independently-owned &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; firms</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Does it cost money to join Sweeten&#8217;s network?</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is completely free for all general contractors to join the Sweeten platform.</li>
<li>Contractors do not pay for access to leads on Sweeten.</li>
<li>General contractors pay a fee, from 3% to 6%, of any awarded contracts they win on Sweeten.</li>
<li>In this model, contractors only pay when they win projects on Sweeten&#8217;s platform.</li>
</ul>
