<h3>Jean: When should you include a designer in your home renovation project?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Bring an interior designer on board as soon as you know you want design services for a home renovation project. Do that immediately after you&#8217;ve sat down and identified your scope of work. You will want the designer to understand what your goals are.</p>
<p>Hash through those design elements very early on so your designer can help convey that design intent to your contractor. That&#8217;s what really starts the language to make certain your contractor understands your needs and the budget implications of your overall design goal. Your <a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/interior-designers/a33434747/why-hiring-an-interior-designer-is-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designer and your contractor will work in tandem</a> to achieve those goals. They will mitigate any construction problems which may arise, particularly if you&#8217;re working in an older home.</p>
<h3>Jean: Where do you start with a designer? How do you know what style you want?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Most clients don&#8217;t really have a real definition of particular styles. If you ask them, ‘What&#8217;s your design style?’, they don&#8217;t necessarily know that. Folks will often say, ‘Here&#8217;s a Pinterest board’ and try to develop a mood from that because they can&#8217;t really identify the styles.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s contemporary, what&#8217;s Baroque, what&#8217;s Art Deco, what&#8217;s classical. But they can look at something—an image—and that visual exactly identifies how they feel. Do they feel relaxed? Do they feel comfortable? Do they feel like they&#8217;ve been transported to another country? Do they like exotic elements or bohemian elements? How those items make them feel is really the storybook for what you want to tell.</p>
<h3>Jean: How do you budget a designer?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Designers charge either <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flat fees or project fees</a>. If you&#8217;re not really certain about whether you can splurge on a big project and have your designer see the project all the way through, you might just hire a designer to essentially do a concept fee. That designer will then sit down with you, identify your scope of work, and try to pull in elements and materials that you like. Identify the wood finishes. Do you want porcelain floors, tile, floors, marble floors? What kind of tile do you want? Do you want simple, basic subway tiles? Do you want a really elaborate laser-cut fancy tile?</p>
<p>Once you decide these things, go to any Home Depot or materials tile store. I recommend bringing samples to your initial consultation or first meeting with your designer. Showing ‘the kinds of things I like’ will start to identify early on where your budget&#8217;s going to go. As you&#8217;re developing your scope of work, you&#8217;re identifying for that person what the overall budget is going to be. The designer can help identify how many hours they will need to spend on the project. This will ultimately determine the designer&#8217;s fee, and how much time they need to commit to the project to see it through.</p>
<p>Again, if you don&#8217;t have a big budget for a designer, which is going to start likely at $5,000 for a concept fee or similar, at least you get enough to share with a contractor.</p>
<h3>Jean: Is the black matte finish trendy?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I absolutely think it&#8217;s going to be trendy. I particularly recommend staying away from trends. If you anticipate being in your home for 30 years, in five years, you&#8217;re going to want to rip that black hardware out.</p>
<p>I suggest you stay within the realm of the nickels. Patina brass or unlacquered brass will take on a lovely patina over time and is one of my favorites. Yellow and white metals have longevity. They&#8217;ve been around hundreds of years and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/decorating-with-gold-accents-adds-glamour-to-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they work within any environment</a> whether it’s contemporary, ultramodern, or traditional.</p>

<h3>Jean: What do you think about the subway tile trend? How do you personalize it?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I’m seeing a lot of subway tiles everywhere. I think at one point, everyone&#8217;s going to just start saying, &#8216;I&#8217;m ripping out all these baths with all this subway tile, because it&#8217;s just everywhere.&#8217; It&#8217;s sort of over-saturating all of the imagery right now. And I understand it. It&#8217;s a nice clean look. It&#8217;s extremely affordable. So your money goes a long way. But if you&#8217;re going to do the subway tile, instead of it all being white, I suggest you integrate some sort of graphic pattern and change the directions of the tile.</p>
<h3>Jean: What is the best flooring for kitchens and bathrooms?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I am really a lover of porcelain tiles. Extremely durable, easy to clean, maintenance-free. Porcelain tile has many different textures now. I don&#8217;t recommend real wood in a kitchen, but there are many beautiful porcelain tiles that have graining to them. They have nice color ranges that really look like wood. I think they&#8217;re fantastic.</p>
<p>I never use polished marble in bathrooms due to the slip hazard. When they get wet, you can break your neck. So stick to matte finishes, you&#8217;ll save your life.</p>

<h3>Jean: What do you think about Ikea kitchens?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen some lovely kitchen&#8217;s done with Ikea cabinetry. When it&#8217;s done with beautiful stone tops and Ikea cabinets, I think it&#8217;s beautiful. I enjoy seeing glass inserts in the uppers, I&#8217;ve actually done this on a project.</p>

<p>Emily Henderson, TV host and namesake behind the <a href="https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Style By Emily Henderson</a> blog, and Sweeten&#8217;s founder, Jean Brownhill, have a conversation on making your best home through remodeling and design. Read some of Emily&#8217;s &#8220;aha!&#8221; interior design tricks and insight below.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Jean: Emily, what are your interior design tips to get more space or maximize small spaces?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-functional furniture</span></p>
<p>Think double-duty, for sure—ottomans with storage, sideboards that have cabinets. When you’re looking for furniture, think, “could this also have another function, a storage function?” That definitely helps.</p>
<p>In a smaller space, having less furniture will help you. It’s easy to be like,  &#8220;Well, this is a small sofa and then I have this small chair and this small chair…” and sometimes all of that will actually end up making the room look smaller because it’s busier. Think about bringing as little contrast as possible if you’re trying to make a room feel and look bigger.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoid a focal wall</span></p>
<p>Sometimes the desire is to have a focal wall, which I totally get. But it does chop up the space. It makes your eye feel like the space is smaller when it’s chopped up. We have an accent wall rule, and we&#8217;ve blogged about it before…essentially, if it&#8217;s a niche, if it&#8217;s a dedicated space that architecturally is addressed differently, then that&#8217;s a great opportunity for an accent wall. But if you have four walls in a room, don&#8217;t just paint one a different color—it just kind of chops up the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg" alt="studio bedroom and living room" width="800" height="538" class="alignnone wp-image-48381 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-24-600x404.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners hired designer Julia Oddo for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/small-space-renovation-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio apartment renovation</a></p>
<h3>Jean: When and who should be hiring a designer?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of time and experience</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re doing a pretty big renovation, whether it&#8217;s a whole house or even just doing your kitchen, and you truly don&#8217;t have the time, the desire, or experience, it&#8217;s a good idea to<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> think about hiring an interior designer</a> strictly because you&#8217;re going to make mistakes. Even we make mistakes all the time. It&#8217;s a luxury service, but I would say if you don&#8217;t have the time to really do the research to figure out how you want it to look and have the experience, then an interior designer will benefit you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design on the next level</span></p>
<p>Hiring an interior designer will take your house to the next level. You&#8217;ll probably get more custom pieces. It&#8217;ll look more unique than if you bought all from different big box stores, but you don&#8217;t have to do it. You truly don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The internet has made an average homeowner able to buy a great sofa. And because of Pinterest and Instagram, people can really do it themselves. Again, you&#8217;re still going to probably make some mistakes, but that&#8217;s okay. Whereas I think 30, 40 years ago, they didn&#8217;t have the resources. We didn&#8217;t have the stores.</p>
<p><strong>Jean:</strong> You always talk about how you want your house to feel. Interior designers don’t just create a vibe. They deal with the elements of the actual things that you feel and touch, like the sofas and pillows.</p>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s my favorite stuff for sure. It&#8217;s the layering that makes it feel like a unique home.</p>
<h3>Jean: How do we save time and money designing a home?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do the preliminary work</span></p>
<p>If you’re working with an interior designer, and you have a pretty clear vision, that saves them a lot of guessing, a lot of back and forth. If you have a sofa you love, show it to them, because they&#8217;re going to source 10 different sofas to show to you and that takes time. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-interior-design-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior designer&#8217;s costs</a> for their time is usually on an hourly basis. So I think the more work you can do upfront, the better.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spend on &#8220;wow&#8221; pieces</span></p>
<p>I have a different philosophy on where to splurge and save than everybody I know. These days there are very good sofas out there that are not that expensive that will also last for years. I feel like you should splurge on the conversation pieces like that amazing rug that nobody else has or a really great piece of art that will create a conversation. They&#8217;re the pieces you typically see that are vintage or custom, where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh my God, I need&#8230;&#8221; That is going to just shift everything in the room and elevate everything.</p>
<h3>Jean: Can you tell us what to do with blank or boring walls?</h3>
<p><strong>Emily:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personality for each wall</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome DIY artwork out there right now. I do have a rule about decorating your walls. When designing a room, address every wall differently with a different style. One wall might be a gallery wall, one might be a mirror, one might be a diptych, and one might be a sculpture. Whether it&#8217;s a gallery, big single art piece or diptych, grid, sculpture, or mirror, those are the five go-to&#8217;s that we use to address all walls.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg" alt="dining area with gallery wall and open shelves above a piano" width="1707" height="2560" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47432" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-DiningRoom-03-scaled-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1707px) 100vw, 1707px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s dining area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gallery wall</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Art is the key</span></p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking around and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I have one small piece on that, one small piece on that wall,&#8221; that might be something that you could change pretty easily that would make your house feel more styled, more pulled together. Also, art is the number one way to make your house feel like a unique, personalized space for sure.</p>

<p>Daria and Deanna had lived in the Sutton Place neighborhood in Manhattan for seven years before they purchased their 700-square-foot apartment. Seeing the potential for much better layout, they reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to pair them <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a general contractor</a> to take on their full gut renovation. The end result? A two-bedroom home, infused with chic <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/16/millennials-with-old-souls-splash-out-on-grandma-chic-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grandmillenial </a>home design; now with a modernized kitchen, a second bedroom, and a walk-in closet with a work desk.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daria:</strong> (00:10)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I&#8217;m Daria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (00:11)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I&#8217;m Deanna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daria:</strong> (00:12)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home in Midtown East. We&#8217;d like to walk you through <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/millennial-sisters-buy-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our home renovation project</a>. We&#8217;ve been living in Sutton Place for the last seven years and knew this is where we wanted to stay. It&#8217;s close to our office, close to the heart of the city. Yet the further east you go, it provides a quiet suburban-like atmosphere that we were after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (00:27)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we first saw this apartment online. We saw that it had been sitting on the market for over a year and that was due to the fact that the layout was like a jigsaw puzzle, and that it hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;80s. However, we both saw long-term potential in the fact that we could turn this into a two-bedroom. So, fast forward two years later, we did a gut renovation and today we have a comfortable two-bedroom apartment. The master being 12&#8242; x 14&#8242;, the second bedroom being 9&#8242; x 11&#8242;. We have a 7&#8242; x 10&#8242; walk-in closet, and we have a bathroom that has a 20-square-foot walk-in shower. In total, the apartment’s about 700 square feet. And surprisingly, we have a lot of storage and a decent-sized kitchen that has a wraparound counter and a wine rack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (01:29)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our favorite part of the apartment is our dining room doors. If we had got them custom made, they would have been a few thousand dollars. However, we got doors from Lowe&#8217;s, had someone make the &#8216;X&#8217; designs, and had our contractor assemble them for a fraction of the cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daria:</strong> (01:47)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we were doing a gut renovation, we knew we had the freedom to do what we wanted in the kitchen. What was really important to us was that we had full-size appliances and a great space to cook and entertain, which we love doing. We kept the colors pretty neutral here, but knew that we needed a pop of color, which is what drew us to this backslash, which is true to our style.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (02:10)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, to keep costs down, we were going to keep the wood floor that was in the apartment. But when we started demolition, we quickly realized that wasn&#8217;t a possibility. It was a thin wood veneer and it started to warp. My sister and I decided that we would put hardwood flooring down because it&#8217;s practical, it&#8217;s easy to clean, and it&#8217;s great for resale value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (02:32)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original footprint of this bathroom was extended and we decided to keep it in order to accommodate a 20-square-foot walk-in shower. We put the handle on the opposite side of the shower heads so you don&#8217;t get wet walking in. And to keep costs down, we put subway tile on the wall. But to make it a little richer looking in here, we decided to do a marble floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daria:</strong> (02:59)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to one of my favorite places in the apartment, our closet. After looking at numerous apartments, we realized that the master bedroom was always too large. The first thing we thought of was a giant walk-in closet, which is everyone&#8217;s dream in Manhattan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deanna:</strong> (03:12)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took advantage of the 70-square-foot closet by putting a workspace, our shoes, our clothes, and even our jewelry. But the best part is, is that these units can easily be taken down so you can comfortably fit a daybed or even a couch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Daria:</strong> (03:23)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn&#8217;t be happier with the outcome of our apartment. We hope you enjoyed this tour and good luck on your renovation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41431 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg" alt="bedroom, bedroom renovation, home renovation tips for bedrooms" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color. It&#8217;s a slightly off-color of the Manhattan bridge.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:06</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Jean! Hey, how are you?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:07</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hey, I&#8217;m great. How are you?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:08</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to introduce you to our builder, Dave.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:10</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hey, nice to meet you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:11</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Hi Dave.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:11</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Jean&#8217;s with Sweeten.com, and she specializes in matching homeowners with renovation experts. And so she&#8217;s seen demos, renos, and all the kinds&#8230;(<em>laughs</em>).</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:22</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Oh, yeah, we literally have seen everything.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:22</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:23</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re really glad to have Jean from Sweeten here because we have this un-permitted breezeway that the Holtzclaw&#8217;s inherited. And she knows what it takes to solve these problems.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:33</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of times that happens, you&#8217;ll buy a home and you think you can renovate something that&#8217;s been un-permitted and it&#8217;s like peeling back layers of a nightmare, right?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:40</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s like a Pandora&#8217;s box. So once you touch one thing, you know this?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:45</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:45</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Everything has to be up to code.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:46</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:46</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">You can&#8217;t just fix the electrical. You have to fix the plumbing, you have to fix the structural, and the foundation. And I think that people think that like, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need to hire a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed general contractor</a>. You know, it&#8217;s too expensive or it&#8217;s too cumbersome.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:57</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">00:58</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">But the reason why there is a license to be a general contractor is because you have people&#8217;s safety in mind. And this space is obviously not that.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:06</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Absolutely.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:08</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">So first thing that we need to do is strip all these walls. So we&#8217;re going to demo all these walls, get it down to studs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:12</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Amazing.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:12</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right, You ready?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jean:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Builder Dave:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:13</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">What are we waiting for?</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:14</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">All right, I got a hammer for you. Swing away.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Design Team Darren Keefe:</strong> (<span class="s1">01:20</span>)</p>
<p class="p1">Nice.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #15 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Why should I move out during my renovation? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The answer is, because you love yourself, and you want to stay healthy. There are so many airborne particles in the air during a renovation, from paint to sometimes, asbestos. We highly recommend that people <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move out of the space when they&#8217;re gut renovating</a>, although it&#8217;s not necessary for every project or to move out for the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for some reason, you can&#8217;t, whether it&#8217;s financial or otherwise, we suggest that you put some kind of vapor barrier between the space where you are living and where the renovation is happening. You want to make sure that you are healthy throughout your entire renovation. Think about it: while someone is demoing, they usually have a mask on and they also leave the property. You don&#8217;t want to be sleeping in a room filled with dust particles. We definitely suggest to at least move out of your space during the dusty demolition phase.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #14 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Should I take the lowest bid? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The short answer is no. To us, a bid that is significantly lower <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">than all the rest</a> you&#8217;ve received is a red flag. Usually, that means someone has missed something: maybe they didn&#8217;t look at the drawings or don&#8217;t really understand the project. If estimates are all within a certain percentage of each other, you like the person who bid the lowest, you communicate well, and you really love his or her style and craft—absolutely go with them. But just don&#8217;t hire your cousin&#8217;s nephew&#8217;s brother who says he can do it for half the price. We have been called to try to fix that kind of project many times—it often doesn&#8217;t work out well.</p>

<h2>Etiquette isn&#8217;t just for formal occasions! Read on for simple etiquette tips for working with your contractor.</h2>
<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to #13 in our Renovation Question series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re tackling a question regarding etiquette for working with a general contractor and their crew. Luckily, with some small gestures and clear communication, you&#8217;ll set yourself up for success.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the proper etiquette when working with a general contractor?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>When a general contractor crew is working in your home, I think people wonder about things like &#8220;Do I offer them water?&#8221; or &#8220;Can I contact them during off-hours?&#8221; Obviously, it&#8217;s up to you. Just keep in mind that these folks are in your home for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long period of time</a>. Anything you can do to maintain a professional relationship and make it a pleasant work environment is positive. We want people to be comfortable and to be as productive as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting up a separate text thread using apps such as WhatsApp versus direct texting offers a specific place to discuss business that is not on personal time. If your contractor&#8217;s team will be in a hot apartment, it&#8217;s a nice gesture to have a refrigerator filled with water for them. Similarly, you can make bathroom arrangements for them. It doesn&#8217;t have to be yours, but you could make sure that there&#8217;s a bathroom in your building they can use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After you&#8217;ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-important-when-hiring-a-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired</a> a Sweeten contractor, letting the other contractors know that you&#8217;ve moved forward with another firm and thanking them for their time is a courteous way to close the loop.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #12 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:team@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: How do I document change orders? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>Each general contractor has his or her own methodology when it comes to documenting change orders (changes that alter the original scope agreed and signed upon), but they should definitely be documented in some way. Change orders can be as simple as a contractor opening up a wall and discovering that pipes or electrical wires need to be replaced or updated before installing an appliance. Another common change order is when a renovator chooses materials that require special installation, such as a tile that has a complex pattern or is very small or large-format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Documenting can be a quick snap of a photo with a written description and the cost; just make sure that changes are documented, understood, and approved on your end before they move forward. Have that conversation up front with your general contractor because inevitably (or I would say with most projects), there are at least one or two change orders.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: How many contractor bids should I get? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>We find that three bids give you a really good sense of where the price range for your scope of work falls. You also get the chance to meet different personality types of general contractors so that you can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the best fit</a> for the way <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-important-when-hiring-a-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you like to communicate</a> and for your project.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #10 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: How much time should I set aside for selecting and ordering materials?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The amount of time really depends on your selection process. When I go shopping, I like to be in and out of the store as soon as possible, but I have plenty of friends who spend a lot of time looking for the perfect pair of jeans. Start by considering how you shop in other areas of your life and how much time you like to spend researching and comparing prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to choosing and deciding on materials on your own, it&#8217;s a good idea to communicate with your contractor on the product items you&#8217;re considering; different materials require different levels of labor. For example, a mosaic tile is harder to set and needs a much more skilled subcontractor than what a standard penny round tile would call for. To keep things running smoothly, it&#8217;s best to have everything ordered before the renovation begins. So, give yourself plenty of time to see what you like and keep your general contractor in the loop throughout the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have more questions on selecting and ordering materials, check out our blog posts on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops </a>and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood flooring</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #9 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is an alteration agreement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>If you live in a co-op or condo building in New York City, you&#8217;ll have an alteration agreement. In the document, your board lays out all of the rules and guidelines for renovating in your building to ensure there is minimum disruption to your neighbors while a renovation is in progress. This can include rules on the allowable work hours (to limit noise) and when the freight elevator will be open for deliveries or materials. When you&#8217;re buying, or if you&#8217;re thinking about renovating in a co-op or condo, you should read your alteration agreement immediately before talking to a general contractor; you&#8217;ll need to share those guidelines right from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important piece of information usually found in the agreement is how much insurance your building requires. This amount is usually from $1 million to $3 million, which you&#8217;ll want to relay to any contractors you&#8217;re speaking with in order to make sure that they have that coverage in place before they even step foot inside your home. If you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project on Sweeten</a> and include this amount in your profile, Sweeten will make sure to only match you to contractors who can cover the requirement.</p>
