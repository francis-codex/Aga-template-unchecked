<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;<span class="s1">Our contractor was so good that we didn’t need Sweeten&#8217;s support too much. But it was nice to know that Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> was there if we needed them.

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An old Los Angeles garage finds new use</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d been living in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our house</a> for about three years when we started the garage remodel. The home, built in 1936 and located in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles, is a bungalow-style cottage. The most recent appraisal said it comprised 690 square feet; the unattached <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage added an additional 260</a> square feet of “unofficial” usable space. In a house this small, you can’t afford to take a single square foot for granted. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My partner, Tom, and I both work in research administration at the University of California at Los Angeles; I recently completed a certificate for interior design and am in the midst of changing careers. We knew we could benefit from a secondary live-work area. We realized the garage could be it, and that transforming the space could be a rewarding project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Hiring a general contractor with Sweeten</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Knowing we would renovate the garage, we’d agreed it would have to be phase two. We made the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first round of renovations</a> out of sheer necessity after buying the house with a long list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural and systemic issues</a>. The experience of trying to line up dependable contractors had been stressful—even getting quotes. We’d hired the one contractor we could pin down. It was that experience that prompted us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten</a> this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg" alt="Natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52339" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage work space and orange leather couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We renovated the garage when we did because we planned to sell the house. But working from home during Covid made us realize that room to spread out would benefit us while we still lived there. We posted our project and waited to see <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which contractors were interested</a> in taking on a garage remodel in Los Angeles.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspecting the garage&#8217;s structure</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The job wouldn’t be easy. We needed to solve the garage’s long-standing structural issues. The building was more than 80 years old; the roof had begun to sag and we were unsure of the extent of the damage. Perhaps the job would involve replacing the ceiling’s support beams and installing a new door. Or it might require an entire rebuild. We needed someone to inspect the structure and advise us of what was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, that wasn’t as difficult as we anticipated. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor we chose determined that the original beams had been too narrow, and spaced too far apart, to fully support the garage’s ceiling. He also informed us that the two existing single-car garage doors were rotting away and termite-ridden. Our biggest question was, “Do we have enough money” to fix the problems? Turned out the answer was yes, and then some!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg" alt="Garage white cabinets with television" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52348" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating a new living/working space in the garage</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had several goals beyond shoring up the garage. First, we wanted to replace the existing two one-car garage doors with a fully automated two-car door. Second, we needed to install a new outlet for plugging in our electric car charger. Finally, we sought to create a space that would be more than a storage area—as comfortable as our living room, but (because local building codes required it) still functional as a garage. No layout changes would be necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided to give the space the look of a loft. We envisioned exposed wood beams lining the ceilings, crisp white walls, and a lot of natural light. In keeping with that aesthetic, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a lot of the existing materials</a>, including the wood ceiling beams (they are the actual structural supports that already existed with some additional wood reinforcing them) and the original concrete slab floor (we filled in cracks with a special cement caulk and painted it gray).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom doors for a small space</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One big challenge was the garage door. We have discovered that with a small house comes the joy of everything being undersized and therefore not standard. Doors and windows had needed customization, and the garage door was no different—it was narrower than the norm. In addition, we discovered that the garage floor sloped, necessitating a custom panel on the bottom of the door that sloped side-to-side with the floor, ensuring a weatherproof seal. The panel, though surprisingly expensive, has been worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls offered no straight lines, either, but our drywall installer was a true artist. The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years. There wasn’t a single straight, vertical wall, and some bowed or curved. The cabinets</span><span class="s9"> </span><span class="s1">provided a good deal of storage and brought a domestic air to what might otherwise just feel like a garage. The countertop is an unfinished pine board and is, like the ceiling, a little rustic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg" alt="natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52350" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg" alt="Blue garage with closed door" width="1000" height="618" class="alignnone wp-image-52359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-600x371.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">The right contractor for a garage remodel in Los Angeles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear communication style</a> and was immensely helpful throughout the process. We could always count on him to respond promptly when we sent him a text or email. More often than not he’d call us back to talk via phone, which I appreciated. He kept us informed of when the subcontractors were going to be working and who specifically would be at our house. And best of all, he stayed on budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our contractor was so good that we didn’t need Sweeten&#8217;s support too much. But it was nice to know that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten was there</a></span><span class="s1"> if we needed them. It was like knowing you have an insurance policy in case of problems; you hope to never use it, but it gives you peace of mind knowing it’s there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The space in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new garage</a> feels generous and comfortable, and the light inside is beautiful throughout the day because of all the windows. The built-in cabinets are attractive (the black pulls provide a nice contrast to the white and wood surfaces in the room) and also bring a ton of much-needed storage. Even though the garage is now a living space, we also needed to make sure there were attractive places to store things.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Samantha</span></i></span></p>
<h3>Recreating an under-used garage</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running their creative agency, VERSUS, in New York City takes up a lot of their time during the day. So Samantha Louise Barnes and her husband, Justin, like to </span>relax at their weekend home in Fairfield County. It&#8217;s located in Weston, which is a quaint small town with tree-lined streets, good schools, and notable architecture. The town is known for its mid-century modern architecture and their home is no exception. It was built in 1948 by architect Lloyd Flood, who was an early associate of architect Edward Durell Stone.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>The couple shares the home, which was previously renovated, with their two-year-old rescue cat, Louise. Set on a dead-end street, Samantha wanted to make the most of her 1,750-square-foot home. That meant converting the garage. They rarely use the second bay. Samantha and Justin take their car to the train station every week and leave it parked there until the weekend. So what to do with this underutilized space? Create that ceramic studio Samantha had always dreamed about, of course.</p>
<h3>In search of a contractor</h3>
<p>Samantha wanted to get the renovation done quickly—preferably in a month’s time. So she started researching, pricing, and locating the equipment needed for the soon-to-be ceramic studio. It was challenging but she found a kiln in South Carolina. Apparently, a lot of people had the same idea to create a ceramic studio during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Once this was taken care of, she set her sights on hiring the right contractor for the job. She posted the project on Sweeten to find a general contractor. “[Sweeten] offered advice every step of the way,” said Samantha. “I felt confident that I would be happy with who they vetted.” Samantha and Justin hired a Sweeten contractor and the project began.</p>
<h3><b><img decoding="async" title="grey-and-black-industrial-design-storage-cum-display-unit" class="alignnone wp-image-50929 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg" alt="Grey and black industrial design storage cum display unit with open shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></h3>
<h3>Figuring out the layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to choose the shorter bay—made smaller by a closet located in the back—and converting it into the studio. Twenty-five percent of the closet would make space for the kiln while the other 75 percent remained as a closet accessible via the other garage bay.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But Samantha also worried about getting the electric requirements correct. So, she worked closely with her Sweeten contractor and his electrician to ensure that the kiln would run safely. They gave the kiln its own outlet and dedicated breaker box.</span></p>
<h3>A ceramic studio comes to life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result of the renovation is a beautiful, artistic space. They kept the back window to allow light to shine through behind the kiln. And added another window above the air conditioner to give a bright airiness to the space. Their contractor also assisted with picking out the double French doors that replaced the original garage door. And figured out the right air conditioner/heating unit to match the electricity needs.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Connecting with the main house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the aesthetics, Samantha and Justin chose to keep some consistency with the main house’s design. For example, the flooring in the main house is a poured concrete so they went with that in the ceramic studio. The concrete fits in nicely with the artistic vibe of the space. Plus, it’s safe to use under the kiln and Samantha likes the “rough” look. The trim is the same as in the main house as well. Material choices and style were to keep a cohesive look and feel. </span></p>

<h3>Finding their general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samantha and Justin first started thinking about renovating, they knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be a big job. However, they did want to find a trustworthy, qualified contractor. &#8220;We are only at our home on the weekends, so we still consider ourselves new to the area and needed a jumping-off place to find someone,&#8221; said Samantha. &#8220;Instead of running through a slew of contractors on the Internet, I thought of Sweeten.&#8221; The result met all the couple&#8217;s expectations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having my own space separate from the house is wonderful,” said Samantha. “It’s additional creative space we just love having access to.”</span></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>
<div></div>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>

<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>

<h3>A new place to call home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This New York homeowner had always owned property in Long Island&#8217;s Southampton, even while working overseas for over 10 years. Upon returning to the United States, she wanted to live closer to the village. So she sold one property and bought the other while still living overseas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house, located steps outside of the village, was a modest two-bedroom, one-bath, 800-square-foot 1960&#8217;s ranch with yellow aluminum siding. It previously had been a summer residence for an older couple who hadn’t touched it since the 1980s.</span></p>

<h3>A clear wishlist</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, the interiors were outdated, storage was lacking, and space was tight. Still, she lived in the home for a year to better understand what she would like to change or improve. <span class="s1">“My vision was modern, functional, relaxed—and most importantly—timeless,” she said.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The beach community location inspired a relaxed vibe.</span><span class="s1"> “But I also wanted a cozy look that was inviting year-round for the cooler months.” said the homeowner. “The house is small and I wanted to keep it that way.” Larger entertaining space was critical while sleeping spaces weren’t as important. “I needed a bit more common space and modernization, including an open floor plan, natural light, and an indoor-outdoor connection,” she said. “Another bath and bedroom were also in the plans.”</span></p>

<h3>Finding a contractor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With her Southampton home renovation ideas and concerns in mind, she posted her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free platform connecting homeowners to vetted general contractors, and found this Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1">She had three goals: a total renovation that included the kitchen; adding a third bedroom and second bath; and expanding the common living space by converting the garage. </span><span class="s1">“I could afford two of the three, but not all three,” she said.      </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">My contractor was honest: ‘I can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.’ So I was able to decide what really mattered and make a very informed decision that I can live with.</span></p></blockquote>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="ranch living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44612" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Refacing the kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The contractor and I talked through options and figured out how we could come closest to getting all three within my budget. Kitchens are expensive but I wouldn’t need to change the layout.”  </span><span class="s1">The homeowner also couldn’t afford to replace all the cabinets. Instead, she painted the lower portion in a darker gray, which masked the door’s oak grain. She refaced the uppers and purchased new doors to change up the style slightly. They went from an arched to a simple raised panel that visually connects with the those below the counter. Hard-to-reach cabinets above the refrigerator were eliminated. All the upper cabinets were painted white, which made the space seem larger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44759" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rosaire-kitchen-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>New floors</h3>
<p>The <span class="s1">existing brown kitchen floor tile was removed and red oak was installed to be consistent with the rest of the house, all stained in a honey hue. New hardware also refreshed the cabinet doors. The contractor also swapped out outdated tile for a feature mosaic under the range hood, and white subway tile on the remaining backsplash. New stainless steel appliances replaced a white refrigerator and dishwasher, as well as a black range, for a cohesive contemporary look. The room also received a new pull-down faucet, sink, and quartz countertop.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“With some creative problem solving, it does look, feel, and function like <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-trends-well-see-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a totally new kitchen</a>,&#8221; she said. </span><span class="s1">Without changing the kitchen footprint, she still picked up additional space. She calls her new walk-in pantry “icing on the cake.” The walk-in pantry is located just off the main kitchen, in part of what was the garage. “Everyone told me a garage conversion for storage was not a good idea because the space was just too small,&#8221; she recalled.</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg" alt="Hamptons kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44609" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Garage-turn-living room</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial step in the Southampton home renovation was to have the 14’ x 24’ garage gutted, creating a new living room. The new room features a vaulted ceiling and a shiplap fireplace, as well as that walk-in pantry. Converting the garage expanded the 800-square-foot home to 1,350 square feet of living space. The homeowner wanted the fireplace to be a focal point. &#8220;I chose shiplap, </span>but the way it was executed was beyond my expectations,&#8221; the homeowner recalled. A shift in the spacing and a slightly larger scale made a huge difference. It was built up to the point of the vault and a thick slate mantle instead of a wood one made it a true statement piece. &#8220;My contractor designed and built it himself,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="ranch living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44611" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>

<h3>A camouflaged finish</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional storage, refrigeration, and less-used items moved into her new pantry. &#8220;I put my microwave and other small appliances behind closed doors,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;It’s still super convenient because it’s attached to the kitchen.” </span><span class="s1">The exterior roofline did not change. “I didn’t want it to look like a garage conversion </span><span class="s1">from the outside,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I built false carriage-style doors on the front exterior so it still looks like a garage.” </span></p>

<h3>Blue, white, and gray palette</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She settled on a mostly white color palette with some gray accents, including new charcoal paint on the exterior façade. The gray carrying over in slate at the front steps, rear entrance door, fireplace mantel, and one bath floor. Blue is a key decor thread, from the outside in. The exterior cladding has a bold new face in blue. In the main living spaces, the furniture has different shades of blue: pale blue well-worn painted metal stools at the counter; chairs around the dining table; and comfy chairs by the fireplace.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows for light with privacy</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Updating the baths also made an enormous difference. &#8220;</span>I happen to love transom windows for some reason,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I placed them particularly in the bathrooms for maximum light with maximum privacy.&#8221; <span class="s1">The master bath’s large walk-in shower are clad in 12’ x 24’ white stone-like Dolomite porcelain tile, with a dark gray porcelain tile grounding the floor. </span><span class="s1">Another update features a stylish new furniture-like vanity in honey-colored wood with horizontal grain that sits on brass feet, paired with a brass faucet.</span></p>

<h3>It all comes together</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her favorite part of her Southampton home renovation actually was the last third of the job. </span><span class="s1">“Each day there was something new, so I could see actual material being installed and the end in sight, versus &#8220;behind-the-walls&#8221; work like plumbing, electrical, gas lines, and new joists,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have windows—yay! I have stained wood floors—yay! As you get close to the end, you start to see your vision in real-time, with day-to-day progress. It makes all frustrations melt away, and you are a very happy person.”</span></p>

<h3>A calm and satisfying finished product</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing the homeowner appreciated was honesty and expertise. “My Sweeten contractor was very patient, accommodating, efficient, and professional. Most importantly, a problem solver. My budget was tight, but I was given solutions that did not break the bank,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My contractor was honest: ‘I can give you this and this, but this is not in your budget.’ So I was able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decide what really mattered</a> and make a very informed decision that I can live with. I am grateful for this.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hands down, her favorite feature is the fireplace. </span><span class="s1">“And adding windows on either side,&#8221; she said. “It’s lovely to watch the changes in the season through the windows but have complete privacy.” </span><span class="s1">The experience of a home renovation in Southampton has been positive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She concluded, “It makes me calm and satiated, confirming that I made the right decisions and that it all turned out as I planned—I got my dream home with my finances intact.”</span></p>
