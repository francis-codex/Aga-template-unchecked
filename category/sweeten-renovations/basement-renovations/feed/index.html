<h3>An unwelcoming basement</h3>
<p>Proud. Calm. Organized. It was hard to imagine a trip down to our cellar—a dark, dank space that I never wanted to set foot in—summoning these feelings. But renovating this space into a fully functioning basement gave us a dedicated workspace for my business while adding an entire floor of living space to our home. It also satisfied some serious storage needs and gave us an occasional guest room for family visits.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg" alt="" width="1110" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg 1110w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px" /></div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We live in a three-family Brooklyn brownstone built in the early 1900s. We&#8217;ve owned it for three-and-a-half years. I am Danielle, owner of <a href="http://www.revampinteriordesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revamp Interior Design</a>; Jevaun is my husband and a design director; Zidane is our son and Katara is our dog. We occupy the parlor, garden, and cellar levels of the building, and the top floors are rental units. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47071" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg" alt="basement remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/sweeten-brownstone-renovation-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we bought the place</a>, we have been redoing it one section at a time, and this was the last of the major projects. We wanted to do a renovation in the basement, which the previous owner had never refinished after a flood years ago. It wasn&#8217;t in great shape: the drywall had been ripped out to prevent mold, and the room had no ventilation or natural light. Junk was accumulating down there. The laundry area was way in the back, and we (I) had to walk through hell to do a load. It was sad.</span></p>

<h3>Organization for a basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The space needed to become a beautiful workhorse of an office. But it had to function, too, as a standard basement and store our family’s things in an organized way. We needed places for coats, tools, luggage, and linens. I came up with this gallery idea with </span><span class="s8">a modern, open look, </span><span class="s1">and we posted our basement remodel project on Sweeten</span><span class="s8">. I wanted one wall to retain the exposed masonry, for texture and grit. For the floors, I planned to pour an epoxy layer over the existing concrete. My</span><span class="s1"> running joke: If I could walk through the basement barefoot, mission accomplished! </span></p>
<h3>Finding new general contractors</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I work in the renovation business, so I initially bid out the job with contractors I’ve worked with. But they were all tied up with projects. I didn’t want to have competing deadlines. Through Sweeten, I met some <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractors</a>. We chose a contractor who seemed most capable and most excited about the job. The cherry on top: He was insanely easy to work with. </span></p>

<h3>Lighting takes centerstage</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goal was to make it bright and spacious. When we moved in, our vision included a den and guest bedroom in the basement. Then I started having this recurring (and prescient!) dream in which I was working from home, and the conversion plan shifted: I wanted to turn it into a design gallery and studio. I needed a workspace with a big, open surface to work with materials and review large drawings. Because of this, lighting would be key. Color is a big part of what I do and it felt critical to have a bright, blank canvas as the backdrop for my work.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47075" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I knew that lighting was the aspect of the redo that would have the most impact. We put in 18 recessed LED ceiling lights; there was not a dark corner in the room. Susan Chan, a specialist at <a href="https://fengshuicreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feng Shui Creative</a> and a friend, recommended I add “uplighting”—fixtures that direct the light upwards—to lift the room’s energy. I thought she was crazy and couldn’t think how to make that work—the ceilings are barely eight feet high. But boy, was she right! The gorgeous pendant fixture I chose made a huge difference in the space, adding both diversity to the light and focus over the island.</p>
<h3>Epoxy floors for a chic basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After we cleared out the stuff, the team sheetrocked the walls and poured the epoxy floor. The exposed masonry wall didn’t turn out as naturally beautiful as we’d hoped it would, but we went with it. The contractors built out closets under the stairs, installed a storage island for a work surface, and hung lots of open shelving. We painted the walls, floors, and stairs in a perfect white—not too cool, not too warm. The furniture plan was the toughest part. I find a “bonus room”—an everything space with 10,000 functions—the hardest to get right for my clients, and it was no different for me. I created a wide-open room and didn&#8217;t want the things I put in it to make it feel cramped.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47076" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg" alt="basement storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting to the finish line</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the room came together, our contractor stopped by often, checking on progress and clarifying details. He gave me a six-week project schedule. The basement remodel was finished the day he promised. The usual setbacks occurred—construction delays, order lags—and our project had surprises, but the crew kept pace and we didn’t go over budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also offered support</a> throughout the project, if needed.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at the finished project, I have so many favorite bits, beginning with the added space. Each floor of the building is about 900 square feet, so we increased usable space by 50 percent—we now have 2,700 square feet. The very best reward downstairs: the perfect lighting. I can work around the clock and never know what time it is. I jokingly call it Vegas!</span></p>

<h3>Choosing between a house or apartment</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My husband and I used to live in Manhattan in a one-bedroom apartment. Once we decided to have children, we knew we wanted to live closer to our families. So we opted to buy a house in the Bronx and have our parents partake in child-raising. Originally we thought we would have one child, live in the area for a few years, and then move back to Manhattan once school started. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we soon fell in love with having a house and wanted to have more kids. Our neighborhood is quite ethnically and socioeconomically diverse. It feels like a nice mix, like we’re away from the city, but not quite in the suburbs. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wanted more living space on the first floor because it’s where we spend most of our time as a family. We also wanted our children, who are 9, 6, and 3, to have larger bedrooms and decided to add a 250-square-foot attic dormer for that purpose. The idea was for the new space to be airy and maximize the view of beautiful trees in our backyard. Our 280-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement converted</a> into a ping pong room for extra recreational space.</span></p>

<h3>Transformation outside the kitchen</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, the window that previously looked out on the old deck was converted to a passthrough window that now connects to the new sunroom. The kitchen countertop was extended about two feet to the end of the wall that divides the dining area and kitchen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Off of the kitchen, we added a 280-square-foot sunroom that includes a bathroom, pantry room, and living area. We were most excited about having a bathroom on the first floor and not having to go upstairs. The pantry provides tons of food, toy, and sports equipment storage. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor deck</a> is off of the sunroom and is 250 square feet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our favorite part of the renovation was working with the architect and our Sweeten general contractor on the layout of the new rooms.</span> <span class="s1">However, the most anxiety-provoking situation was waiting for support beams to be delivered and installed. For two days we had no roof and obsessed about checking the weather to make sure it didn’t rain! </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had experience with all aspects of our project. He was great at giving us ideas and then executing the plan. We also shared the same taste in simple, modern, open design. He was able to deliver exactly what we envisioned. And if you need to file for city permits, our advice is to use an architect who can do that. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great to have Sweeten follow up every step of the way. We knew Sweeten would be there if we experienced problems with our contractor. Luckily, we didn’t need that assistance. Our contractor’s team was excellent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our new house addition space makes us feel less crowded. Now, our children can grow and play without feeling like we’re being swallowed up by all of their toys.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A New Jersey basement transforms into a spot for music, lounging, and laundry</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2015, Cristiana and her husband fell in love with a beautiful old house in New Jersey&#8217;s Bergen County. Original details from 1918 had been preserved, and</em> <em>the space was just right for the family of four. While the above-grade spaces were solid and charming, the basement needed some serious TLC. It featured outdated finishes from the 1970s, low ceilings (a big problem for Cristiana’s tall husband!), and a damp, musty feel. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cristiana knew that the valuable square footage could be turned into a family room, with space left over for wine and pantry storage as well as an updated laundry room. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this contractor</a> to </em><em>convert an uninviting cave into a comfortable spot for the whole family.</em></p>
<p><em><img decoding="async" title="kids-playing-on-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48555 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Kids playing on the vinyl floor with toys after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Guest post by Bergen County, New Jersey, homeowner Cristiana</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago, we were moving from a 750-square-foot apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, which felt like it was bursting at the seams. When we purchased our early Craftsman Colonial home, we knew there would be lots of work to do. But it felt solid, had the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and great, livable space. Plus, the original unpainted chestnut moldings and leaded glass built-ins throughout the new house made any renovations that we needed to do seem bearable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-DURING.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="beige-carpeted-basement-blue-couch"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48543" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige carpeted basement with blue couch and furniture before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

This meant demolishing the &#8217;70s-style finished basement. We weren’t that upset about losing the brown paneling, damp rug, and linoleum-tiled laundry room, and we were saving a lot of money by allowing the electrician free access to the walls and ceiling of the basement. The space had to be refurbished before it could be used for anything besides storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a couple of months of rewiring, patching, and painting, we temporarily relocated the toy storage and our TV to the enclosed front porch and began working with an architect to rethink the space. We came to Sweeten to find a contractor to execute our architect’s vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our plans included moving the laundry room to free up the main living area for toys, creating a craft area, and carving out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine room</a>. An old phone booth left behind by the previous owners was relocated. We hoped to move as many pipes in the labyrinth hanging from the ceiling to provide more headroom for my 6’ 4” husband and our two future six-footers—our sons, currently ages six and eight. New windows were installed and additional waterproofing was added throughout the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Christiana_Basement-66-e1508331601201.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="gray-white-basement-recessed-shelves"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg" alt="Gray and white basement area with recessed shelves and view of handrail and banister after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="oak-vinyl-plank-flooring-basement"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48558" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg" alt="Oak vinyl plank flooring in white entertainment room after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we got started working with our Sweeten contractor, we tried to determine where waterproofing was necessary and figured out what pipes could be moved and what had to stay. We ran PEX pipes for water in the walls and were able to run all electricity through the ceiling. We had to leave our steam pipes for our original but completely functional heating system because it was cost-prohibitive to move them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor also created easy access points for a (hopefully not so distant) kitchen renovation. In the end, the ceiling in the basement was raised from under six-and-a-half feet to over eight feet tall—a huge improvement and a crucial part of the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the not-so-glamorous phases of waterproofing, plumbing, and electric were completed, we began to see the new rooms take shape. We were surprised by the space that needed to be left between the block walls and the drywall for fireproofing but decided to incorporate built-ins for board games as well as arts-and-crafts supplies. Our contractor also built a custom shelving unit under our TV to help prevent kids from walking into the corner of the TV when it was pulled out from the wall. The area under the stairs turned into a fort for the boys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the walls, we chose a warm gray paired with a soft white trim. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> are COREtec, which looks like walnut but is actually an engineered plank that’s perfect for below-grade spaces. This was one of our contractor’s best recommendations—a floating floor that is easily replaced if it gets wet, feels great underfoot, and looks amazing.

A wall-mounted drying rack is one of my favorite features. My kids and husband have turned the storage room into a music room, but as long as they don’t mind playing next to our second freezer and extra Cheerios, it works for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s about it for the first phase of our basement renovation. Of course, there are still items on the to-do list. We are planning to turn the wooden phone booth at the bottom of the stairs into a fun space for the boys<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it has working electricity, so we are hoping to wire it with wifi or as a charging station. We will also either paint it red (Londonesque) or blue (Doctor Who!), and add a plaque on the top with our last name. Next to the phone booth is a door that leads to our unfinished wine room, another project for the future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For now, though, we love spending time in our new basement—and getting dedicated storage for the toys, drums, and storage off the main floor! It’s become a great family room for us to hang out in, and for the boys to play with their friends. Working with our Sweeten contractor was an amazing experience. He was cooperative, made great suggestions, and brought the project in on budget.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>

<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42868 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg" alt="washer and dryer basement" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-laundry-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refinish a basement in Ardmore, Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When David and Wendy bought their 2,700-square-foot home in a Philadelphia suburb, one thing was for sure: the smelly, dated basement had to go. David completely demoed it with every intention of refinishing it after they moved in. Two years later and the basement had become a storage room instead of the recreational space for “serious TV watching,” an exercise area, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/">bar</a> that he’d hoped to create. &#8220;I never got around to it, though, and finally hired someone through Sweeten,&#8221; David said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to take on the unfinished basement once and for all, David <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> on Sweeten and chose this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Since he’d already completed the demolition, they hit the ground running and kept his main goal of having a &#8220;dedicated space for TV-watching where [he] didn&#8217;t have to worry about large speakers ruining the decor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they had to determine how to best lay out the basement to meet his multi-purpose needs. A cousin who owns the interior design firm <a href="https://lkdesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LK Design</a> helped David figure out where to position the bar, fitness equipment, and the entertainment seating. Coming down the stairs from the main floor, the exercise area was set up directly to the right and away from the main living space. The bar and mini kitchen open conveniently to the seating area for easy access. Low ductwork presented a great spot to place the cabinetry and sink, and to maximize headspace as much as possible, they placed the bar directly under an exposed steel beam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for finishing touches, they outfitted the theater with plush carpeting for optimal comfort. For the remainder of the flooring, David decided on more durable (plus pet- and kid-friendly!) vinyl plank. The kitchen and bar got a luxe touch with granite <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, gray cabinets, and chrome hardware.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35322 noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35316 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-area-granite-countertop" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48564 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen area with sink under grantite countertop and gray cabinetry after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Overall the biggest challenge (aside from determining the layout) was getting the bar sink installed below the sewer line. Fortunately, a plumber found a solution and installed a pump. Their Sweeten general contractor also provided invaluable assistance getting a full-size refrigerator down the narrow staircase, not to mention handling a few issues with vendors and navigating delays. &#8220;We had gas lines in the way of the ceiling, and he had a plumber who was able to reroute the lines in a very cost-effective way. Previous plumbers I had found only suggested much more expensive solutions,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking ahead, they also prepared for possible wiring needs down the line and “future-proofed” throughout the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does the family feel about their new hangout space? &#8220;Comfortable and relaxed,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="low-white-ceiling-blue-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48569 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Low white ceiling with blue walls in the entertainment room and fitness equipment after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: David and the contractor installed built-in cabinets in the corners of the entertaining area to hide the gas meters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Carpeting: <a href="https://www.mohawkflooring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohawk</a>. Lifeproof vinyl plank flooring: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Cabinets, cabinet fronts, faucet: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikea</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiana and her husband</a> took advantage of valuable square footage and turned their basement into a multi-purpose space complete with a family room, wine storage, and laundry area.</p>
