				<h3><span>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</span></h3><p><span>I was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio and have been in and out of construction all of my life. My father was in the trade, and my grandfather was an architect.</span></p><h3><span>How did you get into this industry?</span></h3><p><span><span style="font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400;">My father was a union painter for 20+ years. </span>When I was young, I helped him on side jobs. I got into carpentry and the construction side of the industry when I was in high school.</span></p><h3><span>What do you love most about what you do?</span></h3><p><span>I love working with clients and helping them put their inner thoughts and ideas on paper. It&#8217;s great making them come to life. Clients become so happy with their new bathroom. It&#8217;s personal for them. They&#8217;ll always remember my team and what we all created together. </span></p><h3><span>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New Jersey?</span></h3><p><span>The biggest challenge is controlling expectations, timelines, and the unforeseen. As a contractor, we only have so much control. We rely on our workers and subcontractors to show up. It&#8217;s our job to make the process as seamless as possible for the clients.</span></p><h3><span>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</span></h3><p><span>Typically, the biggest misconception homeowners have when renovating is budget. There are a lot of moving parts and materials they don&#8217;t realize are required. Since we only use high-performance materials, items can cost much more than what&#8217;s seen on HGTV.</span></p><h3><span>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</span></h3><p><span>Follow your gut! Dealing with a general contractor is a business relationship, so work with those you instinctually get along with and trust. Make sure you like who you are dealing with. It makes the process much more manageable.</span></p><h3><span>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?</span></h3><p><span>Do your research on design first. Figure out what you like, what you need, and then a dream list of what you want. Next, calculate how much money you can, or are willing to, allocate towards that project. The initial meeting will be smoother if you have a bit of that information ready.</span></p><h3><span>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</span></h3><p><span>I ask homeowners to make a list so we can talk through it.</span></p><h3><span>What is your favorite project that you’ve done and why?</span></h3><p><span>We did a full renovation for a designer from Paris in midtown Manhattan. It was highly detailed with high expectations and stress. The end result was gorgeous.</span></p><h3><span>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?</span></h3><p><span>In my opinion, general contractors should know how to perform the work they expect their subcontractors to execute. I feel a huge advantage when I can jump into any trade. I can help them if they require assistance, at any time.</span></p><h3><span>What is your favorite building?</span></h3><p><span>Picking a favorite building is near impossible. I have a deep love of architecture and old pre-war buildings. The buildings in Paris are mind-boggling to me. I love to sit and look at all of the details. I just imagine how they were executed at such a high level with minimal tools on hand.</span></p><h3><span>What is your favorite city?</span></h3><p><span>Paris/NYC</span></p><h3><span>What is your favorite restaurant?</span></h3><p><span>This question for me is a little unfair as I was a chef all around the U.S. for many years. Some that are staples for me would be Ippudo, Le Bernardin, Los Tacos, Marea, Le Coucou. The list could go on.</span></p>					</div>

After accumulating many years of experience in engineering, design, construction, and management, the company started in 2018.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">How did you get into this industry?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">I partnered up with an experienced project manager after seeing photos of the homes he was working on. Seeing the process of building uniquely gorgeous homes inspired me to approach my business partner and the rest is history!</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most homeowners underestimate the amount of coordination and paperwork it takes to make a project successful. Contracts, change orders, insurances, sub-contracts, payment schedules, and invoicing are just a part of the back-office work that needs to be completed, no matter how big the job. Managing the actual construction includes scheduling labor, sub-contractors, and material deliveries.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">We like our clients to know that we are on the same team as them. We work together with our clients to get a common goal accomplished. This means we like to find out what&#8217;s most important to the client and then tailor the project to reflect those wants.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are constantly talking, texting, and/or emailing with our clients while planning and throughout the course of construction. We usually set up a group chat or email chain to get client questions answered fast and get material selections approved.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is your favorite Los Angeles building?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Peterson Automotive Museum in LA/Fairfax area melds, glass, steel, and color. It is a gorgeous sight as your drive by.</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is your favorite Los Angeles neighborhood?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">I love visiting Malibu and enjoying the fresh ocean air!</span></p><h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</span></h4><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Product development. Much like the construction process, I love making products by turning conceptual brainstorming ideas into real products that people enjoy.</span></p><p><em>Check out<span> </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7235#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haim&#8217;s<span> </span>portfolio</a><span> </span>for photos of his past work.</em></p><p><em>Haim has been a Sweeten general contractor since November 2021</em></p><div class="UISection__ScrollWrapper-dfybmh-0 zPhhK is--module namespaced-hack-section"><div data-test-id="formatted-input-0"><p>—</p><p><em>Sweeten handpicks the best general contractors to match each project’s location, budget, scope, and style.

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/7193#overview">Check out Sweeten general contractor Jennifer&#8217;s portfolio here</a></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am from Alexandria, Virginia in the metro Washington, DC area.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How did you get into the construction industry?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was graduating college and there was a threat of my father being laid off from his construction job of 20+ years. New management and budgets cuts were taking place. At the time, I was also interning at the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulations. I learned about the lack of women-owned construction companies in the state. It just clicked: With my father&#8217;s remodeling experience and my desire to create a more stable future for our family, there was an opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I asked my father if he would partner up with me to start our own construction company. He would lead the field team and do installations. I would spread the word about his knowledge and experience to home remodelers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our first project was with a homeowner who hired us to build a small kitchen pantry. Little by little, we were recommended to neighbors and became known as a reliable and easy-to-work-with contractor in the community. Over time, we took on an array of projects in DC and Virginia, from simple build-outs to full bathroom, kitchen, and basement remodels. We grew into the experienced company we are today!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do as a general contractor?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The best part of our job is getting the chance to change the sometimes negative narratives about contractors. From time to time we have customers come to us after bad experiences. We aspire to leave all of our customers with good impressions and a first-hand example of what a good experience with a great contracting company can look like. I like to treat my customers how I would like to be treated, with respect, good communication, and quality service. &#8220;Do good unto others&#8221; are words I live by.</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1">We enjoy putting that into practice in every aspect of what we do. Ultimately, I love being able to make people feel happy with the remodeling experience as a whole.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The biggest misconception is that a renovation is going to be overwhelming and complicated. With proper planning, preparation, and communication, a renovation can be fun the entire way through!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite renovation project that you’ve done and why?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We recently completed a full condo remodel in Arlington, Virginia. The homeowner was a woman who wanted to work with a woman-owned contracting firm, a woman-owned interior design company, and a woman-owned virtual assistant company. From beginning to end, the remodel was spearheaded and completed by a team of women-owned companies. The project turned out gorgeous and it was truly so much fun. We celebrated with a fabulous housewarming party that our customer invited us to. It was really neat to be able to experience the space we helped create!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC/Arlington/Fairfax, VA building?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite building in the Washington DC area is the Spy Museum building. It is designed to look very modern and futuristic. I can appreciate the architecture and the way it stands out in the landscape. It&#8217;s worth checking out!</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite Washington DC/Arlington/Fairfax, VA restaurant?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MoMo Sushi in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. They have the most delicious and fresh sushi I have ever had. It is also nestled in the cutest neighborhood close to the Old Town waterfront with great views of the Potomac River and Washington, DC.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If I weren&#8217;t a general contractor, I&#8217;d own a coffee shop. You can find me trying a new latte and reviewing plan sheets at all of the local coffee shops.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been an NYC contractor?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I am from Astoria, NY and have been in construction for seven years.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>How did you get into this industry?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I always bought and sold properties after renovating them. After selling my share of a business in the energy sector, I was approached by a friend to work for his construction company before starting my own.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I love designing, enhancing, and seeing a satisfied customer&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is the biggest challenge about being an NYC contractor?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Dealing with things out of our control is a challenge, such as the lead times on materials and the DOB process. Sometimes the DOB makes errors leading to unexpected delays.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s a misconception around not understanding the budget and the time required to complete a project. Homeowners can also carry with them the memory of a bad experience of a previous contractor who did a poor job.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Our most important attributes are transparency, managing expectations, communication, and customer service.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Construction is far from perfect but we make up for it through our communication style and how we make adjustments when issues arise.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Quickly and through email, text, phone, or our job tracker application.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite project that you’ve done and why?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I renovated a brownstone in Brooklyn where the homeowners were extremely hesitant to hire us because of the cost. It was hard to win them over because of poor experiences they&#8217;ve had previously. It was a gut renovation of an entire brownstone and resulted in being a phenomenal showpiece. It was great to see how satisfied they were with their decision and how the space was completed converted.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Be transparent and really know your craft before making promises that you find out later you can&#8217;t keep. This leads to mismanagement of expectations and upset customers.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite architectural structure?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Arc de Triomphe in Paris</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite NYC neighborhood?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Manhattan</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite NYC restaurant?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">11 Madison</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>If you weren’t an NYC contractor, what would you be doing?</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d be in real estate.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></h3>
<div>
<div>
<p data-test-id="formatted-input-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Andreas:</span> I obtained my Bachelor&#8217;s and Master&#8217;s degrees in Civil Engineering and worked for several design firms in New York City.

<p data-test-id="formatted-input-0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lambros:</span> My passion started even before coming to the USA.

<h3><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></h3>
<p><u>Andreas:</u> We always put an emphasis on our client&#8217;s needs and desires for their home. We want our clients to trust the process and we promise that we will deliver more than expected. We always put our clients first.</p>

<p><strong>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure. I really can&#8217;t think of anything else to do. I&#8217;ve been in construction most of my life!</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p>We are from Los Angeles and have been in construction, as a company, for 12 years.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>
<p>As a child, I&#8217;ve always had a great fascination with construction. I&#8217;ve been lucky to be able to work with what I love for as long as I can remember.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p>I love helping people achieve their visions to make a house feel like home. Meeting new people and seeing the way they think, their creativity makes the job a lot easier. It gives me great satisfaction to hear that we have gained a client&#8217;s trust for future projects.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in Los Angeles?</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we have faced is getting the proper permits that allow us to commence a project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p>Clients seem to assume that because they already have most of the work in a house/ condo/ townhome done, that renovating should be quick and cheap. What they fail to understand is that if, for example, they want to remove walls, we have to get the proper permits to allow us to start the project, which can take longer than anticipated. Renovating can be quite expensive, having to get the proper plans, materials, basically starting from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>We always want to let our clients know that they can trust us to work towards their visions. We want them to feel like they are part of our family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation?</strong></p>
<p>Clients should keep in mind that patience is the number one thing needed to start a renovation project. We try our best to help them understand the process, but they are always welcome to ask more questions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</strong></p>
<p>As always, clients are welcome to call at any moment with questions or concerns. A project works best when all minds are at ease. We prefer for them to let us know if there are any issues so that we are able to work with them and fix any concerns.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is your favorite project that you’ve done and why?</strong></p>
<p>My personal favorite projects are the ones where the client knows exactly what they want. I once did a bathroom project where the client had everything, including the material picked out for us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to new general contractors?</strong></p>
<p>I would advise new general contractors to be specific in their contracts what the job will be and what they can provide. If there is any change whatsoever, make sure it is written and signed to show proof of consent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles building?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite building is the Walt Disney Concert Hall due to how visually appealing it is. It is a magnificent architectural accomplishment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p>I love many buildings in LA, but my favorite city is probably Silverlake. I love the modern architecture that surrounds it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What is your favorite Los Angeles restaurant?</strong></p>
<p>WP24 or 71Above are great restaurants, both with great views and beautiful designs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</strong></p>
<p>I would probably be a florist if I wasn&#8217;t a general contractor.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction? </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was born in New York but moved to Los Angeles with my family when I was only six years old. I am proud to have built a design-build firm out here in Los Angeles that specializes in all different types of projects. From <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">residential remodeling</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete home renovations</a> to new construction, we are a one-stop source for quality design and construction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you love most about what you do?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My job has so many different facets to it, which makes it exciting. I enjoy creating, designing, and seeing a project come to fruition—seeing it take shape into a concrete design. I also love seeing my clients happy and really appreciating the new space we created together. It is rewarding to see the finished product and the joy that it brings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want them to know that I truly have their best interest at heart. I want them to be completely satisfied with the project and I will do whatever it takes. It&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my top priority</a>. After all the time and energy that you put into a construction project, you shouldn&#8217;t just like it, you should love it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation? </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Permits and plans are required for some jobs, which can cause delays. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s totally out of my hands. However, we will try to make up time while ensuring the project is on point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What is your favorite project that you’ve done?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My favorite project is a <span class="s2">house</span> that I just finished in Sherman Oaks. I was tasked with repurposing an outdated 1930s garage into an <span class="s2">ADU</span> (accessory dwelling unit). ADUs are popular in Los Angeles and the homeowners saw an <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opportunity to add more space</a> to their living area. They needed their <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old garage converted</a> into an office and guest suite. And they also hired us for <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their main house</a>. We made it an open concept layout and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bathroom</a> and closet. The final outcome is beautiful but what really makes it my favorite project is how much the homeowners love it. They said they are in &#8220;pure bliss.&#8221;</span></p>

			<h2>The duo loves nothing more than making their clients&#8217; vision come to life!</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37919 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IlyaNina-723x844.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="844" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IlyaNina-723x844.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IlyaNina-257x300.jpg 257w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IlyaNina-600x701.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out Nina and Ilya&#8217;s portfolio here</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m from the country of Georgia and I’ve been in construction ever since Ilya started our business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I was born in Russia, grew up in Australia, and finally settled in New York City in my early 20s. I&#8217;ve been in the construction business professionally for 12 years. As a teenager, I used to work on construction sites almost every summer, and that is really where I developed a love of building.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into this industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: When Ilya started our business 12 years ago, he always leaned on me for inspiration and advice. Ilya had a construction background, while mine was in marketing and advertising. He’s the expert contractor and I manage the back end of the business along with communications, marketing, and social media. If you see a smiley face in one of our emails, I probably wrote it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I have always been interested in things that allowed me to be creative. Even as a kid, I was a Lego’s master! I went through culinary school in Australia, then jewelry school in New York City. I worked as a master jeweler, which is so similar to construction and building—only on a much smaller scale. Ultimately I decided to pursue my passion for construction and building.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: I’m a big people pleaser, and I love nothing more than knowing that our clients are truly happy with the home that we helped them design, build, and personalize.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: I love the process of being able to help take someone’s vision and turn it into a reality for them. When I see the look on their faces when they walk into their finished home, it makes the hard work all the worthwhile. No two projects are ever alike which always leaves plenty of room for renewed creativity!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35917 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GCs_Embeds-SiteVisit.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Definitely all the red tape that comes with the management companies and co-op boards. I’m the lucky one that gets to deal with all of that!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya:</span> The biggest challenge—besides traffic and parking—is navigating all the different management companies, co-op boards, building codes, and permit regulations. These processes are a lot harder than they really need to be, but we always work hand-in-hand with everyone involved to ensure we have all the requirements going into the project so there are no delays along the way.</p>
<p><strong> What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Renovating is expensive and not as simple as shown on television! There can and usually will be surprises along the way, so it’s always good to pad your budget by 10%, just in case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Pricing and budgets. So many folks don’t understand how expensive renovating in NYC can be! And while Pinterest can provide some amazing inspiration, their budgets oftentimes can’t support those ideas.  But that’s where our creativity kicks into full gear and we get to suggest amazing alternatives and more affordable options for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: The Chrysler Building—it’s gorgeous!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: My favorite modern building is the IAC building right across from Chelsea Piers, but my favorite classic NYC building is the Chrysler building.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nina</span>: Brooklyn Heights, especially the boardwalk with the view of the Manhattan skyline. It takes my breath away every time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ilya</span>: Soho! It has the best mix of modern and classic architecture.</p>

<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I currently reside in Queens, NY, but I am originally from Albania. I have been in construction for 15 years, and have worked on many projects, including residential and commercial properties. </span></p>
<p><b>How did you get into the industry?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started working as a painter in 2004, and six months later I was promoted to a project manager. I continued to work as a project manager for several years. Throughout that time, the general contractors I worked with recommended that I start my own company because they recognized my talent. After considering it for some time, I finally opened my first company, PK Painting and Decorating Inc. and later became  PK &amp; Sons Home Improvement. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you love most about your job?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love talking to clients and helping them bring their dreams for their homes to fruition. It makes me happy when I see that my clients are happy with the work my team and I did</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is the best part of the job. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients should know that my team and I are very reliable and we are on their side throughout the whole renovation process. Their comfort and happiness are my number one priority. If any surprises come up during the project, we will find a solution and won’t do anything without their consent and approval. </span></p>
<p><b>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am always available to help with any questions or concerns. Whatever it may be, I want the client to know that I am here to help them 24/7, whenever they need it. </span></p>
<p><b>What is your favorite neighborhood and where is it located?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downtown Brooklyn and Forest Hills, Queens are my two favorite neighborhoods. They are the easiest for me, work-wise and I enjoy working there.</span></p>
<p><b>What is your favorite NYC borough? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite borough is Queens: I’ve lived there the entire time that I have been in the U.S. Everything is so convenient and close by!</span></p>
<p><b>If you weren’t a general contractor, what would you be doing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I wasn&#8217;t a general contractor, I would be a project manager. I love construction—I feel that it is the best field to work in and it is a skill that I love having.</span></p>

<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;re both from Poland and have been in construction for about 10 years.</p>
<p><b>How did you get into construction? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paulina</span>: I had to be like 11 years old when my dad hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house. I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of drawings and blueprints. I thought, &#8220;Wow, this is really, really amazing.&#8221; Ever since I met that architect, I was inspired to design. Later, when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to design and build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-sheets-value="&#091;null,2,&quot;\nP: My dad, for me, I think. The first time, oh my God, I had to be like 11. He hired an architect to design a little fireplace outside of our house and I thought she was so cool because she came out with a lot of the drawings and blueprints and stuff. And I was like, \&quot;Wow, this is really, really amazing.\&quot; So, for me, it was seeing her being an architect and designing. I wanted to design and then when I worked for a construction company, I decided I actually wanted to also do design and build.\nA: Actually, construction was like my passion. When I was 19 years old, I just started to do something small in the house. I loved this from the beginning and that's like my hobby now and I work this really, so I like my job.\nP: You did a lot of wood working.\nA: Yes.\nP: Built like stuff when he was younger.\nA: Yeah, and younger. 15 years old, I--\nP: He worked as a carpenter since he was 16 years old?\nA: Yeah.&quot;&#093;" data-sheets-userformat="&#091;null,null,769,&#091;null,0&#093;,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0&#093;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Albert</span>: Construction has always been my passion. I did a lot of woodworking when I was very young and worked as a carpenter when I was 16. I loved it from the beginning. What used to be a hobby became something I did professionally. I love my job.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about construction?</strong></p>
<p>Different projects and the clients—you pick a project, go from start to finish, and then start again with a different project. There&#8217;s a uniqueness to the changing environment.</p>
<p><b>What is your ideal client?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Someone who has a general sense of what they’re looking for, but maybe didn&#8217;t have a chance to get the advice they needed. I like when we find somebody that we can actually help. They&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Okay! Nobody actually explained it to me like that!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>What is the biggest challenge you see for renovating in New York?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of running our workshop, for sure. We have a huge facility where we run a custom cabinetry and millwork shop which we also use for our renovations.</p>
<p><b>Yankees or Mets?</b></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t understand baseball, we&#8217;re Polish—soccer!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Albert</strong></span>: The Empire State building.</p>

<p>In honor of Women&#8217;s History month, we are spotlighting women general contractors in the general contracting field. These <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors are leading the charge and closing the gender gap.</p>
<p>With years of experience under their belts, their firms include experts who handle a myriad of projects—from residential room remodels and full-home renovations to commercial work.</p>
<p>In the last of a five-part series, we feature women contractors who have the skills and industry knowledge to make your home-sweet-home a reality.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara.jpg" alt="Image of a white bathroom with bathtub and a kitchen with gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tara-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>Her projects are primarily in the Houston area working on commercial, residential, and multi-family homes. &#8220;We are small enough to listen and big enough to deliver,&#8221; says Tara.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I found this team on Sweeten and was initially interested because they were identified as a woman-owned business,&#8221; says one client. Another describes her experience with general contractor Anna </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and her team as &#8220;always professional and on time.&#8221; A family business, Anna and her company oversee projects ranging from small-scale interior upgrades to additions and new home construction. The Sweeten contractor also focuses on ADUs (accessory dwelling units), which are popular in the Los Angeles area. Her company has grown steadily over the last 15 years, building a clientele that consistently gives their work five stars. </span></p>

<p>For Women&#8217;s History month, we are spotlighting women general contractors who are in our network. They are leading the way while closing the gender gap. With solid work portfolios, their firms have completed a wide range of projects—from single-room remodels to full-home renovations and additions. This post, the second in a five-part series, profiles some of the most talented <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors across our various cities.</p>
<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Leah | New York City</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47676" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg" alt="Women owned general contractor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Leah_WOO-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>General contractor Leah has owned and operated her contracting business in NYC for almost 15 years, with experience in different points of the process. Her company completes a wide range of construction activities, from pre-development to turnover. Serving both the public and private sector, Leah has worked on projects ranging in scope and skillsets—from a condo fitness center and Victorian home restoration to a modern high-rise apartment. Each of her projects gets assigned a dedicated project manager to ensure it is completed on time and on budget.

<h3>Sweeten General Contractor Ishita | Long Island, NY</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47588 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="532" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark_Ishita-1-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Ishita&#8217;s main focus is customer service. It&#8217;s a point of pride not to use &#8220;pushy sales tactics or upselling&#8221; to retain clients. Instead, she prefers to let the work speak for itself. Ishita&#8217;s general contracting firm handles all different types of renovations in Suffolk County, New York, located on Long Island. For example, she has completed single-room makeovers as well as large estate renovations. The general contractor also plans, manages, and builds multi-phase jobs. Above all, Ishita remains focused on the overall experience. &#8220;It really is about how our customers feel at the end [that matters].&#8221; <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5230#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Sweeten contractor Ishita&#8217;s reviews and work.</a></p>

<h5><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved to the United States in 1999 after completing my military service in Israel as an officer. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founded my general contracting firm in 2001.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovating your home anywhere, especially in New York City, is definitely not an easy task; even for the most seasoned pros. Here are the five biggest challenges we find:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hurrying through the planning phase: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting demolition, be certain your plans, specifications, and details are worked out in precise detail. Before any hammer hits any wall, you and your contractor should do a thorough walkthrough of the space.</span></li>
<li><b>Getting only one proposal or going with the cheapest bid: </b>You should never accept the first proposal you receive. Compare at least three different contractors. Always remember: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
<li><b>If your project is a gut job, consider hiring an interior designer: </b>If your kitchen remodel is a full gut and includes tile, stone, cabinets, and paint, then you will benefit by hiring a designer.</li>
<li><b>Spending money in the wrong places: </b>Make the best use of your budget and reserve the largest amounts for the spaces and features you’ll use regularly. This could be a large countertop or a great cooktop. Remodel the lesser-used areas with simpler finishes like lighting and backsplashes.</li>
<li><b>Living in the apartment during the renovation, or moving back too soon: </b>You’ll have plenty of stress while overseeing your renovation, but living in the midst of it all will multiply that stress.</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we begin working with you, they should think about the goals they want to achieve. Is stellar design the driving force? Improved functionality? Resale? Perhaps you’re looking for energy-saving ideas? Or maybe it’s a combination of all these elements? They should also know their budget. Developing a budget range will help you make decisions when you are choosing materials and appliances.</span></p>
<h5><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation? </b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As contractors, we’ve learned a lot of lessons on the do&#8217;s and don’ts of construction. The number one thing is to be a confident decision-maker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all want our remodel to move forward with as few problems as possible. Make as many decisions about your project before the work actually starts. A good contractor will always discuss a list of possible situations that might come up on your renovation project. Their project manager Nick said, &#8220;Most of the problems are usually connected to choices about small things such as faucet selection, paint, or trim.” These may seem small and unimportant when you start your project. If your faucet is two weeks late because of shipping, your plumber will have to be rescheduled.  This can balloon into a week delay on a four-week project.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite architectural building?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub is my all-time favorite. I love his work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s organic and always feels like his structures could be a skeleton for something that was once alive. </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite neighborhood?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My all-time favorite neighborhood in New York is Greenwich Village. It has pre-war buildings, thriving arts and a foodie scene,.Greenwich Village was and continues to be full of cultural and artistic edge.   </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite NYC borough?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan, although I complain about many aspects of it, like the traffic.  However, I really feel that it’s the greatest city in the world. Despite popular attractions like Central Park or Radio City Music Hall, there is so much more to the borough. Manhattan has classic bars, charming neighborhoods, hidden green spaces, and trendy boutiques.  </span></p>
