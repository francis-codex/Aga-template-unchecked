<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Miami, homeowners are increasingly drawing their design inspiration from color and nature. At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve observed how these themes inform the most popular Miami home remodeling trends. It&#8217;s clear that h</span><span class="s1">omeowners are rethinking both aesthetics and function, indoors and out. In this guide, Sweeten shares popular home remodeling design trends in The Magic City.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in Renovation Financial Protection—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Home remodeling projects in Miami are robust. “They’re putting money into their homes,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. “They see it as an investment.” </span><span class="s1">Adrian said that much of his remodeling work has less to do with adding square footage. It’s more about reconfiguring—taking away and adding walls, refreshing appliances, and fixtures.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen trends for functional and style</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consistently close to the top of the remodeling project list in Miami is the </span><span class="s2">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. “It’s the heart of the home,” said <a href="https://samrobin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based interior designer Sam Robin</a>. “My philosophy about it hasn’t changed much. If I entertain 100 people in my home, they’ll all end up in the kitchen.” With the kitchen serving as both a functional <em>and</em> fashionable space, Miami homeowners are upgrading the room to work hard and look appealing. Below, Sweeten lists the go-to updates Miami homeowners are requesting for their kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="gray-bathroom-with-gold-hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Upgrading kitchen appliances</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So many renovation plans include updating and re-prioritizing the styles and functions of appliances. The nationwide trend is toward cooking with wellness in mind, so steam ovens are becoming more prevalent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Induction cooktops are catching on (“absolutely, very trendy,” said Adrian. Sam said she still prefers gas ranges.)</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Flexible room design</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchens opening to a great room are still popular, with cabinets that look more furniture-like. But there’s definitely a move to closing off larger spaces when desired. Sliding, French, and barn-style doors do the trick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands are being more defined by function, so Sam has specified double islands for some clients. Multi-level counters also are trending. The varying heights allow for different functions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">An organic look: Natural materials </span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the overall look in the kitchen, designer Sam said there’s a trend to more organic, more natural materials. It’s all about changes in textures. Graphic backsplashes include porcelain, terra cotta, or concrete tiles. These can be earthy or bold color combinations or monochromatic tone-on-tone patterns like herringbone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a big trend toward more rustic simplicity, like <i>wabi sabi</i>,” she said, such as cement walls or concrete flooring and countertops. It’s a real organic living space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here are some other top Miami home remodeling trends in the kitchen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Simple, flat-panel cabinetry. Lacquer finishes mostly have given way to matte.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Farm-style and trough sinks are on the rise.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide-planked floors (seven inches wide is average), such as light rift-cut oak or dark wenge.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Statement lighting. Shapes include large scale globes, square-shaped, or linear fixtures, especially over countertops</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Metal hardware. Burnished brass still is trending as well as black matte. Sometimes they’re seen in the same room.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg" alt="Marble bathroom with white double floating vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Bath trends for utility and statement materials</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Adrian has seen freestanding sculptural soaking tubs remain strong in Miami. However, many homeowners are preferring freestanding showers. Features like aromatherapy and steam showers are gaining traction. That’s especially true in luxury condos. <em>(For more info, see <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/miami-condo-renovations-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s Guide to Remodeling a condo in Miami.</a>)</em></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In larger homes in Miami Beach, bigger master baths are open to the master bedrooms. Adrian has installed barnyard-style doors, 6-feet wide (and wider, when more privacy is preferred.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The top Miami home remodeling trends in the bathroom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Floating vanities with integrated stone tops and storage drawers.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Stone and porcelain featuring dramatic veining that can be book-matched on statement walls.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Touchless toilets and motion-activated faucets are desirable wellness/hygiene features.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Multiple sources of lighting &#8211; Sam said while it’s important to include downlights, lighting around vanities (usually sconces) is important so that shadows aren’t created.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, especially with tropical themes, palm trees, or foliage, is very popular in powder rooms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Outdoor space as an extension of the home</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bringing indoor style and all of their comforts outdoors is a goal. No matter what the style, the connection from indoors to out cannot be denied. “We have such an inside-outside vernacular,” said interior designer Sam. “We want to merge it because of a gorgeous landscape. It’s like having a painting in every room.”</span><span class="s3"> Outdoor kitchens feature commercial-style grills, refrigerators, and wine coolers. Fireplaces or fire pits and water features add to the ambiance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg" alt="A stone walkway with palm trees in Miami" width="1000" height="1363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-220x300.jpg 220w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-600x818.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Coral was repurposed for a walkway and retaining wall by designer Sam Robin. Photo by Ken Hayden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been doing large terraces,” said Sam. “And getting into more hardscaping, like paving materials. There’s a lot of wood, like ipe, a tropical hardwood that withstands the elements. Other materials for the outdoor space include travertine with grass in between, microcement, Keystone coral, and big boulders to create ponds. We’re creating spectacular views, framed by foliage.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indoor rooms opening up to terraces with a series of French doors or doors that fold back is another way to connect with the outside.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Home offices get a makeover</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam also has gotten a lot of requests for home offices—homeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Clients want a good back wall, appropriate for video meetings,” said Sam. “Something more professional looking, with style. They also want space for the kids to focus with computers and homework. Not just a playroom for a bunch of Legos.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam said that allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of function. For example, sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty, with sleepers and desks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“And there’s creative storage,” said Sam. “Closets can be transformed into storage file systems with nice millwork, which can be opened up (when needed) instead of having a separate room. It depends on personal preference.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some even opt for more than one home office; the addition appears to be boosting resale value, even with a modest investment.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Miami home remodeling trends: Design details in the home</span></h3>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Impressing guests <em>and</em> personally savoring spaces</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Homeowners are investing money in renovation details that are big and small—all of which make an impact on daily living. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rolling bar carts make way for built-in cabinetry which holds wet bars, undercounter refrigeration, freezer, and wine coolers. “My clients all want wine rooms,” said Sam.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg" alt="Home office with white and beige striped wallpaper" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52389" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sam Robin designed a home office in a bedroom for a pair of teens; painted stripes on the wall. Photo by Kris Tamburello.</span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other rising design trends in Miami home remodeling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide plank flooring, with an average of seven inches wide, in lighter woods like ash and oak. “It’s a European country vibe,” said Adrian.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Architectural light fixtures in simple modern shapes, linear forms, and organic shapes that feature leaves and tendrils are catching on</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">LEDS are replacing halogens. There’s more accent lighting, like under-cabinet and lighting coves.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Graphic tiles (including for the floor), as well as concrete patterned tiles, are quite popular. Black and white geometrics and heritage Cuban designs are inspirations.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Color palettes include earthy tones (creams and tans), blue and white (cobalt to watery blue-green), and vivid bold colors          </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Important structural elements for Miami homes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another important consideration when remodeling in Miami is the threat of hurricanes. </span><span class="s2">Building codes</span><span class="s1"> are strict because of that. Concrete pillars, rebar and steel-reinforced walls, roof trusses and bracing roofs, and hurricane-resistant windows all are part of the conversation. <em>(</em></span><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s guide to Preparing Homes for Hurricanes</a>.)</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are no water restrictions, however, as there are in California. But because of Miami&#8217;s wet climate, materials need to be mold and mildew-proof.</span></p>
<h4>Finding the right general contractor for a Miami home remodel</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miamians are personalizing more while remodeling their homes. In their budgets and work scopes, homeowners ensure there’s more room for a little drama. Bringing these types of specific design plans to life successfully requires an expert general contractor, and architect or design team. Are you looking for general contractor experts near you?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In Houston, home additions are a great way to increase the square footage of a house</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg" alt="exterior of a Houston house addition" width="2560" height="1920" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50209" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_3479-scaled-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Are you living in a home of good size, but need more space? Whether it’s creating another bedroom or increasing the living area, adding onto your property can seem like a complex undertaking. Houston home additions require careful planning and due diligence. With the right general contractor in Houston to manage the approvals and remodeling process, you can realize the potential of expanding your existing home. Your contractor should also be up-to-date with the local codes and regulations. Here, Sweeten provides some guidance on points to consider.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">Make a plan with contractors and architects</h3>
<p class="p1">Unlike smaller remodeling projects, building an addition is a complex, multi-layered project. It requires a team of qualified professionals who can help you.</p>
<p class="p1">A home addition is the total of a vast number of sub-projects. These projects range from design and planning to drywall work, flooring, painting, and more. Plus, these projects extend over weeks or months. There is one person who ties all of these strings together and makes it work: the general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1">Begin planning your project by hiring a licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/houston-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in Houston</a>. The spring and summer are good times to start since it gives you a headstart in the queue for renovations the following year.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Building Houston home additions: Outward or upward?</h3>
<p class="p1">Homeowners in Houston planning for home additions may raise a frequent question: Should you build outward or upward? It’s a difficult question for any area, as both have their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a ground-level addition outward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building outward means creating an addition that is at ground level. The addition is built adjacent to the existing house. At the end of the project, the wall between the two structures is opened up. Building a ground-level addition is less complex than adding to the top of a house. Plus, it is less invasive. Homeowners typically can live in the home while the addition is built.</p>
<p class="p1">Houston is largely a flat, one-story house city. Generally, the area has more single-story homes than double-story homes. Older, historic neighborhoods in Houston such as The Heights, Bellaire, or West U have generously-sized lots. In an era of shrinking lots, properties like this are rare opportunities for building outward.</p>
<p class="p1">Another upside: one-story homes are easier to cool down. Since heat rises, it collects in the second story. As a result, two-story homes are more expensive to cool.</p>
<h4 class="p5">Building a second-story addition upward</h4>
<p class="p1">Building upward means adding a second story to the home. This type of renovation removes the roof and adds extra structural support. Then, the second story is built. With this highly invasive project, residents usually have to vacate the home for an extended period.</p>
<p class="p1">If your Houston property lot is not spacious, you may want to consider building upward. This preserves your yard for pets or children or for gardening.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Permits and approvals</h3>
<p class="p1">Permitted approvals by the City of Houston are required before and after building your addition. Building plans and fees must be submitted to the city before the building begins. Numerous corrections may be required. If approved, a building permit is issued.</p>
<p class="p1">However, this is not your final approval. In essence, a permit is just that: It permits you to build. Once the work is finished, the addition is inspected. If approved, a final approval is then issued.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s best to leave permits and approvals for large projects like home additions in the hands of contractors. These professionals know how to walk your project through the permitting process to minimize delays.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Houston home additions require a plan for extreme heat</h3>
<p>Heat and sun are part of living in the Gulf Coast region. Be sure to consider those inevitable high temperatures.</p>
<p>In the summer, the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. Planning your addition with heat in mind can be as simple as orientation. If possible, orient the addition so that it does not face in the direction of the sun.</p>
<p>Other passive cooling methods include planting large shade trees as part of the landscaping plan. Speak with your contractor about cool roof materials coated in glass fiber and aluminum.</p>
<p>Your current air conditioning unit might be able to handle the increased loads of the new addition. More often, it’s a good idea to install a separate A/C unit for the addition. Mini-split air-conditioning that doesn’t require ductwork is also popular.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Focus on curb appeal and improvements like upgrading outdoor spaces or refreshing a kitchen</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Dallas.jpg" alt="Dallas home value" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Sprawling ranches. Craftsman cottages. Stone or brick architecture reflecting French or English style. A particular Dallas home caught your eye, and location and neighborhood made it right.</p>
<p>Unless you custom-built your home, there are probably some features you’d like to change. Your home may need more efficient windows or the master bath could use extra square footage. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale value. The clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. Here, Sweeten outlines some key tips if you&#8217;re remodeling a home in Dallas for resale.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>What improvements increase your home’s value?</h3>
<h4>Consider curb appeal</h4>
<p>A home’s first impression speaks volumes. What catches your eye? You may notice attractive landscaping, interesting siding, a statement-making front door.</p>
<p>Replacing the front door in a Dallas home can recoup 63.7% of the job cost, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/west-south-central/dallas-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value</a> report for 2020. This is based on a price of $1,803 for steel.</p>
<p>A garage door replacement fetches 62.4% of value, at a cost of $3,600. That’s based on a 16&#8242; x 7&#8242; four-section door with insulated glass windows.</p>
<p>Re-siding a home with fiber-cement is a $15,881 investment for 1,259 square feet. You’ll get a 64.7% ROI (return on investment). For the same amount in vinyl, expect to pay $13,425. (50.6% ROI)</p>
<p>Another high-value project: replacing vinyl siding on the street-facing facade with manufactured stone veneer. The cost for 300 square feet of the bottom third, including sills and outlining entry archway, is $9,276. You’ll get back 86.3%.</p>
<h4>Replace windows</h4>
<p>Sure, new windows provide aesthetics, but the main motivation is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase energy efficiency</a>. Swapping out old windows with thermal windows has an ROI of 62.4% for vinyl and 53.9% for wood. Vinyl windows cost $17,101, based on replacing 10 existing 3&#8242; x 5&#8242; double-hung windows with insulated, low-E, simulated divided lights. The same amount of aluminum-clad wood (with wood frames inside) costs $20,884.</p>
<h4>Refresh the kitchen</h4>
<p>As the hub of the home, the kitchen may be its most important room. Its function is essential for daily living, especially for families and entertaining.</p>
<p>A lower-end Dallas kitchen remodel starts around $10,000 to $15,000. A minor facelift can offer a high return of value:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Maintain the same layout (make no changes in plumbing or gas/electrical requirements)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Replace cabinet fronts with classic shaker-style wood panels</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add new hardware</li>
<li aria-level="1">Add a new sink and faucet</li>
<li aria-level="1">Change out kitchen countertops</li>
</ul>
<p>A mid-range kitchen remodel can begin at $25,000. This is based on a 200-square-foot space with 30 linear feet of cabinetry and countertops. The ROI is calculated at 69.1%.</p>
<p>Major kitchen renovations start from $40,000 and can recover 46.5% of the investment. The difference in features is the replacement of cabinetry and stone or quartz counters with an imported ceramic or glass tile backsplash. It also includes a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, wall oven, and built-in refrigerator.</p>
<p>When updating a kitchen, consider current trends, but lean towards classic upgrades. This will assure that your kitchen has timeless appeal.</p>
<h5>Other major kitchen improvements:</h5>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Adding or expanding an island. This increases storage and creates spots for casual dining</li>
<li aria-level="1">Adding a pantry. Existing or borrowed space may be perfect for a walk-in pantry. If you don’t have space, a tall cabinet with pull-out shelves handles storage needs. Standard cabinets range in size from 12&#8243; to 36&#8243; wide.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Update a bath</h4>
<p>Working within an existing 5&#8242; x 7&#8242; footprint, for example, will be the least expensive option. You still can replace the floor with ceramic or porcelain tile. New fixtures include a 30&#8243; x 60&#8243; porcelain-on-steel tub and a single lever temperature and pressure-balanced shower control. Expect the cost for a low-end bath remodel to be between $8,000 &#8211; $15,000.</p>
<p>A more upscale remodel bumps up the square footage to around 100 square feet. Costs start at around $30,000. All fixtures are relocated, which will increase plumbing costs. Features include a double vanity with stone counter and freestanding soaker tub. A 42&#8243; x 42&#8243; shower with body spray fixtures and frameless glass enclosure also is included.</p>
<p>How you customize your bathroom depends on your wish list. You can adjust your costs according to your priorities. Do you want a rain shower? Are you looking for a special color of stone or porcelain? Or maybe you&#8217;ve had your eye on a special shower or bathtub, which can pique the interest of buyers. A sculptural freestanding tub is a special focal point that makes the room stand out.</p>
<h4>Add or remodel a powder room</h4>
<p>Do you have the space to create a powder room in the main living area? If so, this can bring more value to your home. At an average of 18 square feet, you can splurge on some creative materials, wallcovering, and even bold color.</p>
<h4>Expand your outdoor space</h4>
<p>Outdoor living spaces have become an essential part of the home. Homeowners know the importance of being able to flow easily from inside to outside. This nationwide trend is equally strong in Dallas, a city ideal for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entertaining al fresco</a>. Start by examining your available outdoor space. How can you use that space to create equivalents for how you live indoors? Seating, dining, bar and cooking areas, lounging, and spots for firepits—all are desirable features to choose from.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the value of flora! Landscaping can beautifully frame your outdoor living spaces while boosting curb appeal.</p>
<h4>Upgrading your outdoor deck</h4>
<p>Building a deck in Dallas out of composite material (a mix of plastic and wood product,) costs around $60 psf (per square foot) or just under $19,000 for a 16&#8242; x 20&#8242; deck. The cost for a wood deck (equivalent size, around 320 square feet) is around $40 psf or $13,000. Porcelain tiles are another attractive option. They’re freeze-proof and fade-resistant. Additionally, like composites, they require less maintenance.</p>
<p>In Dallas, wooden deck additions see a return on investment of up to 92%. Composite decks average a return of up to 60%.</p>
<p>A designated spot for a grill usually is in the plan. If you can afford the space and the extra budget, consider a mini kitchen. A built-in grill, outdoor fridge, sink, wine cooler, and even beer taps are among options available today.</p>
<p><strong>With the right help, remodeling a Dallas home for resale can be easy</strong></p>
<p>No matter what your budget is, do your homework before beginning a remodel. Some key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather inspiration photos to identify your likes.</li>
<li>Examine your current routine. How do you use your indoor spaces? How can you use your outdoor space?</li>
<li>Weigh the costs. What do you want to splurge on? Where will you recoup resale value?</li>
<li>Connect with experienced, vetted general contractors in your area. Sweeten can help here!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s easy to save on remodeling costs in Atlanta when you know a few tricks</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49255 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen and dining area" width="1600" height="1068" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-Atlanta-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You love your home, and you love living in Atlanta. But there may be <em>some</em> parts of your home that you don&#8217;t love. Or maybe you just bought a new home, and you know you want to update it to suit you. We see renovation projects in Atlanta at a wide range of costs. Often, homeowners want to maximize their scope on a minimal budget. Luckily, there are a handful of tricks that can help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel smaller and smarter</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For years, one of the draws of living in Atlanta was that you could own a large house for the same—or less than—what you would pay in northern cities. Atlanta <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/10/3/17931250/lending-tree-report-atlanta-houston-biggest-houses-nation"><span class="s2">ranks number two</span></a> in the United States in home sizes. In fact, Atlanta’s average home size is just under 2,000 square feet. But sprawl has its price, which means large homes and large remodels come with higher costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Find ways to remodel that don’t involve creating a new foundation or building upward. If you can, stay within the existing footprint of the house. Explore rooms that are no longer used for their intended purpose and convert them. Tour the house with your contractor and find walls that you can open to expand two rooms into one large room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Look into Atlanta&#8217;s green remodeling incentives</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Green or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eco-friendly remodeling</a> helps the environment and can certainly help you save on remodeling in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many homeowners may not realize that they can take advantage of a host of <a href="https://www.nariatlanta.org/green-remodeling"><span class="s2">green remodeling incentives</span></a>. These incentives can reduce the cost of remodeling. Some of the incentives include tax credits, loan programs, tax exemptions, and rebates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speak to your contractor about your interest in green remodeling. You may also want to have an energy audit done before remodeling begins.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Tailor the HVAC to Atlanta&#8217;s weather</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heating and cooling are different in Atlanta than in other cities. Systems that work in Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York aren’t always applicable in Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a city with fewer than 50 days per year below freezing, Atlanta homes don&#8217;t need the kind of robust furnaces or heat pumps found in other areas of the country. And maxing out your A/C isn’t always the answer, either! Your A/C should be tailored specifically to Atlanta’s weather and to your own house. Also, it&#8217;s smart to explore passive cooling methods with your contractor.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Make use of Georgia’s solar power and natural light</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is one of the sunniest cities in the United States, with at least 60% of the days per year being sunny. Use this to your advantage! Concentrate on improving windows on the south side of your house. Rooms that have plenty of large windows rely less on artificial light. This saves money on electricians’ costs and on the cost of extensive artificial lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At the same time, make sure that these windows have low-e solar coating. Add draperies to block sun during the brightest part of the day.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodel with mold in mind</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta can get humid—extremely humid. Humidity that reaches 55% or more can lead to mold growth. Poorly vented crawlspaces, basements, and rooms are susceptible to mold growth. Not all mold is dangerous. However, some mold can be a lung irritant and can affect those with respiratory ailments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Good remodeling work can be quickly undone by mold. To avoid mold growth, talk to your contractor about mold-inhibiting wall and ceiling systems, along with venting systems.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Refurbish, don’t replace</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The days of tearing out everything and replacing it wholesale are long gone. Now, there is a smarter approach to remodeling that incorporates fixing items, not throwing them out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, you may decide to reface, rather than replace, your kitchen cabinets. Refurbishing cabinets, tubs, showers, floors, walls, and more keep these items out of the landfill and make your Atlanta remodel more affordable. </span></p>
<p><em>Considering new doors for your kitchen cabinets? Get the lowdown on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-411-on-kitchen-cabinet-door-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different cabinet door styles.</a></em></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">DIY projects in an Atlanta remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not all of the work of your home remodel project needs to be done by the contractor’s workers. You can do a few things yourself in advance, or during downtimes. Sweat equity helps you save on remodel costs and make it all more affordable. Always coordinate in advance with your contractor if you plan to do DIY work. (Here’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/diy-vs-contractor/"><span class="s2">what you can DIY</span></a> and what should be left to the pros!)</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Use durable imitation materials</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You might really want that exotic hardwood flooring, but the price of it isn&#8217;t within your budget. Look for wood-look ceramic tile planks that look just like mahogany or other overseas hardwoods. Laminate and vinyl plank also look remarkably like real wood. Quartz and laminate countertops reliably imitate expensive marbles and granites. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wherever there is an expensive material, there is likely a far less expensive imitation material that you can use in your remodel.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Keep the plumbing in place</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One rule of thumb for keeping bathroom and kitchen remodeling affordable: avoid moving the plumbing, if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whenever you move plumbing around, remodel costs rise. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you cannot change your shower, bathtub, or sink. You <i>can</i> replace or refurbish these items while keeping the core plumbing system where it is</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Shop around for the best contractor</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finding the best contractor for a remodeling project in Atlanta isn&#8217;t about finding the cheapest person. Instead, it&#8217;s about finding a person who can best bring your vision to light. </span><span class="s1">Concentrate on finding a contractor who best matches your needs. You’ll also want to find a contractor who you work with well, and who you communicate well with. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Get on the general contractor’s schedule—now</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you sign with a contractor for a home remodeling project, the contractor places you on their calendar. Being in the early queue means getting ahead of other clients, especially when there is overall high demand for home remodeling, labor, and materials. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Ask your expert for remodeling advice</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One of the upsides of hiring a general contractor is that you can take advantage of their knowledge and expertise. </span><span class="s1">Feel free to ask for their advice&#8230;that’s why you hired them! Contractors can have years or decades of experience in construction and the right one will help you match your scope to your budget.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no surprise that baths are topping many remodeling lists these days. In Houston, real estate comes in a variety of architectural styles, from French Country and bungalow to Queen Anne and ranch. Plus, b</span><span class="s1">ath trends today cover a range of décor styles that are compatible with your home’s architecture. For those considering their own small bathroom renovation in Houston, here are the need-to-knows and items to plan for before you begin.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your goals for your bathroom renovation?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For most people doing small bathroom renovations, updating the bathroom design is the #1 priority. Who doesn’t welcome a glow-up, especially in the bathroom? Modernizing dated cabinetry and hardware, and installing more stylish faucets are go-to options. So is swapping out a tub for a shower. Or, upgrading the shower with a thermostatic system with integrated volume control. Maybe your luxury shower dreams include multiple body sprays and a rain shower! Many homeowners opt to remove old, tired </span><span class="s1">for a refreshed version. Another key focus in bathroom renovations is adding extra storage. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are your needs?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s easier to figure out. Who will use the bath? In a medium-sized bath, do you prefer a tub or shower? Single or double vanity? Take clear notes on any must-have features in your bath. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgeting for a bath remodel in Houston </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help you sort it out, here is what you can expect to pay in Houston, on average. Retaining the footprint in a mid-range bathroom remodel in Houston starts at around $15,000, up to $25,000. Costs will vary based on the materials used, as well as the complexity of installation. For example, a mosaic backsplash is more affordable when the tiles are installed on a sheet. Micro mini tiles installed individually will be more labor-intensive—and more expensive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Materials costs can vary greatly as well, with super affordable options available at big box stores, versus high-end imported tile companies. A powder room may slide into a slightly lower entry-level for costs, but again, it depends on the materials you choose! <em>Read more about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/2020-cost-guide-for-a-home-remodel-in-houston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home renovation costs for Houston.</a></em></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are you likely to recoup in value?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sixty percent, according to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Vs Value</a> report for Houston. Or, almost $12,000; based on a 5-by-7 foot bath that costs around $19,000 or $542 psf. This includes a new 30-by-60 inch porcelain-on-steel bathtub, new single-lever temperature, and pressure-balanced shower control, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How long does a Houston bathroom renovation take?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Sweeten contractors, construction time averages about two to three weeks. However: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning, executing, and finishing</a> can take six weeks to three months—depending on the size and complexity of your project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to get the most bang for the buck</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When your space is dimensionally challenged (read: small), and you don’t have the room or budget to expand, you still have plenty of options. One way is to create the illusion of more space, by doing one or more of the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Use wall-mounted vanities and toilets.  That extra floor space opens up the room.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Another space enhancer: a solid surface vanity counter with an integral sink.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Install a wall-to-wall mirror behind a long vanity or an oversized round mirrors. Mirrors visually expand space. Some streamlined designs incorporate medicine cabinets.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">A classic pedestal sink also is visually slimming. Modern washstands, usually in metal frames, are on-trend options, especially white on black. More traditional sinks with turned console legs offer additional metal choices, like brass or polished nickel.</span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Building in storage wherever you can tuck in shelves for towels and essentials. Recessed niches in the shower for shampoo and conditioner also are smart.  </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Swap a tub for a roomy walk-in shower with an all-glass frame. If there’s a window, natural light will flow through, visually boosting the dimensions of the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why should you consider neutrals in the bathroom? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many homeowners opt for white and beige in baths because it’s safe. But that doesn’t mean it has to be boring! Designers use a few tricks of the trade to keep neutrals feel fresh. One trick is the magic of tone-on-tone—but with nuances. (That means mixing different shades of neutral, from light to dark.) Another trick is to pair neutrals with different textures.  Get this look by pairing a dimensional wallcovering or an embossed tile with a polished or smooth surface.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding color to a bathroom </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We love when homeowners go bold in the bathroom and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/home/design/article/35-ideas-to-amp-up-your-bathroom-s-style-15404821.php#photo-19670294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color outside the lines</a>. Some argue that vibrant colors can take over smaller spaces, like powder rooms. But others feel that’s the perfect venue for bold cobalt or emerald, a spicy tangerine, or saffron. Precisely <em>because</em> it’s a small space, you can afford to be dramatic—and even splurge on faucets and towel holders, plus lighting and a fancy wallcovering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Color doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to walls: consider the countertop or the vanity. Blues and greens—bright and pale—are gaining traction in traditional, country, and modern styles.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Comparing bathroom remodeling materials</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone has some hefty competition these days from porcelain tile. Porcelain is not confined to small format 4-, 6- or 12-inch tiles. Porcelain comes in slabs, some very thin yet sturdy, which can be applied to walls and floors. And with digital technology, manufacturers are able to replicate some of the most desirable marbles (Carrara or Calacatta) or granites.  The look of exotic-colored stones also is available with remarkable authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, matte black is a hot trend in faucets and hardware. Burnished and polished gold are also trending, and pairing them with black is especially chic. Mixing metals, like satin metal and polished nickel with gold also is more acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One guideline for choosing materials that are basically semi-permanent: Being on-trend (modernizing the classics) is fine, but being trendy (here now, gone tomorrow) is not.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Be sure to allow enough time</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as you have a plan, try to get through the selection process for materials as quickly as you can. Ask about inventory even before you place your order, so you’re not disappointed. You may be unpleasantly surprised to find that your favorite tile or stone, or that dreamy vanity you&#8217;ve got your eye on, will take an extra 6 to 8 weeks to show up. However, i</span><span class="s1">f you can’t imagine living without it, go for it! It may be well worth the wait.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Demolition and prep</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On average, ripping out old bathroom material is a day’s work. It depends on how large the room is, and how extensive the renovation will be. For instance, removing a tile floor or wall may take a bit longer. Tweaking plumbing and electrical, which may require rerouting or new wiring, also is part of the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Installation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve passed through the rough and dirty parts, and now you’re in the fun phase. When surfaces, fixtures, and lighting get installed (allow 1 to 3 days), take a moment to enjoy it! Grab some pictures on your phone to show your family and friends. </span></p>
<h3>Follow the experts&#8217; lead for small bathroom renovations</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">An outline from permits to building requirements for condo remodeling Miami</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45354 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg" alt="A brand new condo remodeling Miami" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miami-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">City of Miami building permits </span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Are you considering condo remodeling in Miami? While renovating a condo is usually a more limited proposition than renovating a house, Sweeten offers guidelines on a few special considerations you’ll need to take into account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First,</span><span class="s1"> you will need to obtain the proper city and building approvals before beginning your project. Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6622#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Sandra</a>, who is based in Miami, tells us, “The typical process takes about 4-8 weeks for a mid-sized project. [Usually,] the office management has pretty much the same requirements as the city.” You must apply first to the city, and once the city approves the permit, the information is submitted to the management office for the condo. The most common permits required in a condo remodeling Miami project are </span><span class="s1">floor soundproofing, plumbing, electrical, and framing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements </span></h3>
<p>In addition to obtaining city permits, many new building projects must also meet new building requirements. You must usually meet and comply with regulations around work hours, rubbish removal, gas installation, and more. Licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/miami-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Miami</a> with experience would be able to navigate any building paperwork and restrictions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of everything you should be mindful of during your project:</p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">1) Working hours</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">These are more limited than in a free-standing house. Typically, buildings will permit workers access between the hours of 9AM &#8211; 4PM (occasionally, until 5pm) on weekdays. This translates into shorter working hours. As a result, a condo renovation may take longer than that same project in a house.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">2) Prepping common areas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Buildings will require workers to protect the common lobby, hallways, and elevators. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Just note, this can keep the GC from working on the actual project on any given day. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">3) Rubbish removal</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">As in all large buildings, trash removal presents a bigger obstacle than in a free-standing house. As Miami-based Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami contractor Adrian</a> explains, due to the more protracted process, “the cost of removing the trash is much higher in a condo than in a single-family home.”</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">The cost for a trash removal service is based on the number of “pulls” it takes to remove debris. According to Adrian’s experience, to remove and replace floor tile in a 1,000-square-foot condo, he estimates it would require four pulls (2-3 for old tile, and one pull for new tile waste). The cost would be around $3,000.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Sandra concurs: “We spend a lot of time doing this and do it on a daily basis. That means we need to reserve the elevator every time we have to bring it down. We cannot use the building dumpster, so we need to put it in our truck and haul it away.” </span></p>
<h4 class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s2">4) Altering the slab</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Since even the oldest Miami condos date only back to the ‘50s and ‘60s, they are largely concrete structures. Sweeten contractor Sandra explains, “It is possible but very complex. We would need a structural engineer affidavit and structural plans.” Management will likely be strict about this aspect of the renovation. After all, altering the slab can affect the building&#8217;s other units. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s1">Technically, it is possible to trench or drill to lay plumbing or electrical. However, you would need to prove that you will not compromise the integrity of the slab. Oftentimes, buildings will require “scanning” (via a professional vendor) of the area where the proposed alteration will occur. Sweeten contractor Adrian estimates that it usually costs approximately $600 to scan 100-200 square feet. </span>“If you are going to core drill, the building may not require an engineer to sign off on the alteration,” said Adrian. “But if you are going to trench along the slab then they most certainly will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">5) Gas</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Most Miami condos feature electric stoves and dryers. That said, gas stoves are becoming slightly more common in new luxury buildings. Our Sweeten contractors do not know of buildings that permit gas dryers. If your condo unit does not currently have a washer/dryer in-unit, there’s a 50/50 chance that it’ll be permitted. Again, this is up to your management company’s rules. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">6) Windows</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4"> Due to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the seasonal hurricanes</a>, building codes require impact windows. Luckily, this isn’t the responsibility of the individual renovator because windows are typically a building-wide project. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span class="s3">7) Fees</span></strong></h4>
<p class="p5" style="padding-left: 40px;"><span class="s4">Lastly, expect the management company to charge you a fee for renovating your condo. Just note, these fees are paid in addition to any permit and approval charges. These fees aren&#8217;t unique to Miami, this is standard in condos across the U.S.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Now, you should have a sense of what to look out for in your Miami condo renovation. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best general contractors in Miami</a></span>.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Houston natives can list many great things about the city: Houston is one of the most diverse cities in the South, and it has a vibrant culture. Houston residents enjoy a relatively low cost of living. But if there is one aspect about Houston that most residents would like to change, it’s the floods. In Houston and Harris County, floods affect huge sections of the city on a regular basis. </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines ways to protect your home from flooding in Houston. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why Houston floods devastate homes</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Houston’s wet season, from May to October, brings a punishing round of tropical storms, hurricanes, or just old-fashioned heavy rain. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Houston rests near Galveston Bay, four major bayous, and numerous creeks. Floods are a fact of life in a city surrounded by so much water. If you live west of the city center, your home will generally hold up better during flooding. Residents of EaDo (East Downtown), Garden Oaks, Highland Village, and Midtown tend to fare better than other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">M</span><span class="s3">oving eastward from the city center increases the likelihood of high water levels and floods. </span><span class="s1">Kingwood, Spring Branch, the Heights, and Sharpstown all flood regularly. </span><span class="s2">Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda turned these neighborhoods brown with floodwater</span><span class="s1">. The storms hit Meyerland, located mostly within the 100-year floodplain, particularly hard.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Houston and Harris County are so heavily paved-over that runoff water cannot keep pace with these huge increases of water. Short of </span><span class="s4">moving to another city, you can take a number of steps to protect your home: </span></p>
<h4 class="p8"><span class="s1">Tip 1: Grade soil away from your house</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Houston&#8217;s mostly flat topography only rises about 50 feet above sea level. You won&#8217;t find steep hills and high elevation in this city. But you can create a type of &#8220;micro-elevation&#8221; on your own property.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When building or renovating your house, redesign your property’s grading. Regrade with proper water, erosion, and storm runoff management in mind. You want to avoid your yard and home turning into a lake.</span></p>
<h4 class="p8"><span class="s1">Tip 2: Install a sump pump and maintain it</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If your Houston <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">house has a basement</a>, it undoubtedly already has a sump pump. If not, install one immediately. Sump pumps discharge interior water to the exterior. It is valuable for high waters or for minor interior flooding. However, it will not protect your home against catastrophic flooding. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your sump pump should be ready to turn on at any time. If not, it may experience power loss, clogging, or switch issues. If the unit cannot keep up with the water, install a larger unit. </span><span class="s1">The average lifespan of a sump pump is about 10 years. If your sump pump is at the end of this lifespan, consider replacing it.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 3: Raise your house</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">The best solution to protect your home from a Houston flood is to elevate it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">At a very minimum, the City of Houston requires homes to have a one-foot elevation above the 100-year floodplain. But that minimum nowhere nearly addresses catastrophic events, like the rapid 12-inch rainfall that fell during Hurricane Harvey. If you plan on elevating your house, experts recommend elevating your home over 18 inches. Six-foot elevations are not uncommon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">When building a new house, resist the urge to build slab-on-grade if living in a flood-prone section. Instead, explore elevated foundations of three feet or more. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">If you already own a house, you can retroactively elevate your house. This retrofit begins much like a house move, with the house raised by jacks on piers. But the house isn’t loaded onto trucks and moved. Instead, a new, higher foundation is placed under the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Elevating your home starts at about $75 per square foot. It&#8217;s a major project that can take up to three months to complete.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 4: Dry floodproof your foundation</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Imagine the outer part of your home’s foundation wall as the hull of a boat. Water constantly surround a boat&#8217;s lower half, so it must be watertight. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Dry floodproofing treats your foundation with sealants and membranes. If water surrounds the lower section for a limited period, there should be little or no leakage into the home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">With dry floodproofing, the emphasis is on positive-side (exterior) sealants and membranes. Workers also apply negative-side (interior) sealants and membranes. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">FEMA recommends homeowners opt for a “substantially impermeable wall.” The wall helps limit water accumulation. In 24 hours, water will accumulate to a 4-inch maximum with a sump pump. </span><span class="s1">Entrust this project to a qualified contractor who has experience in dry floodproofing. Contractors well-versed in this project can often exceed that FEMA minimum performance level.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 5: Install flood vents</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">In lieu of dry floodproofing, consider installing flood vents. </span><span class="s1">Contractors can install FEMA-compliant flood vents in your foundation walls. In dry times, these vents prohibit vermin from entering underneath your house. During floods, these vents open freely to allow the passage of floodwaters. At the same time, these vents block debris that can damage the structure.</span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">Flood vents may also help you reduce your flood insurance premiums. </span><span class="s1">Houston homes receive so much structural damage because of the force of the water on the foundations. Flood vents reduce that pressure.</span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Only certain types of foundations require flood vents. Many older Houston homes have a crawlspace foundation that supports the house with piers or columns. This foundation often has a skirt or non-load-bearing wall around the house perimeter. Sometimes, brick or concrete comprises the skirt wall instead of wood. Because the wall cannot hold back floodwaters, dry floodproofing is not a viable option. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Many Houston contractors can advise you on how to protect your home from flooding in Houston. They can assess whether dry floodproofing or flood vent installation is your best option.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Tip 6: Install and maintain a backflow valve</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">During floods, one unhappy byproduct is sewer or water drainage backflow. During this, backflow sends sewer water into the house. Floodwater itself is dirty enough. But when sewage pipes directly into your home, that only adds insult to injury. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Some backflow valves are automatic, such as ball float valves in floor drains. On the other hand, manually-operated gate-style valves open and close by turning a wheel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Note that backflow valves prevent your house’s sewage from running into the sewer main. Standard backflow valves provide no way for you to <span class="s1"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-hung-toilets-look-behind-scenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flush a toilet</a></span>. Speak to your contractor about backflow valves with ejector pump attachments. These attachments can divert your sewage back into the sewer system, while still preventing backflow from coming into your home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">More ways to prevent or ease flood damage in Houston</span></h3>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Raise exterior outlets </span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Electrical code typically requires only that exterior outlets be accessible from grade, or ground, level. For Houston with its floods, this usually translates to “too low.” </span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">An electrician can relocate your exterior GFCI outlets. The outlets should be at least one foot above the expected flood line.</span></p>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><b>Check your exterior drainage system</b></span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Your house’s gutters collect rainwater from the roof. Drainpipes move that water downward. Make sure that this interdependent system works properly which your contractor can assess. If your system needs repairs, they can recommend and install solutions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;"><b>Install waterproof flooring at (or below) grade</b></span></h4>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">If your home’s lowest level is on-grade or is below-grade (like a basement), avoid installing carpet, solid hardwood, or engineered wood flooring. As long as that level remains dry, you are fine. But if that level overflows with water, the best response is to remove the flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1" style="color: #000000;">Hard-surface, 100-percent waterproof flooring stands a good chance for successful cleanup. Consider installing ceramic or porcelain tile, resilient plank, sheet, or tile floor.</span></p>
<p>Using these ways to protect your home from flooding will provide peace-of-mind. Understanding your options based on your budget and the type of home you have is a good start.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45280" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg" alt="garage remodel nashville" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nashville-Garage-Blog-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are like many homeowners, you may be looking in all directions to increase living space. Looking upward means building a second story. Looking toward the back translates to a house addition. But one direction that is often overlooked is to the side or front: the garage. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how a garage remodel in Nashville could be your solution amid several home addition options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Types of garage remodels</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living rooms or family rooms</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide supplemental living or family room space. The garage is insulated, wired, painted, and flooring is installed. Sometimes, a small powder room, with only a toilet and sink, is added. The powder room eliminates trips to the main part of the house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for renters</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some homeowners choose to install a self-contained apartment for renters. This arrangement can give the homeowner a source of passive income. Over the long term, it may defray the cost of the garage remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Living quarters typically include a bedroom, full bathroom, and a kitchen. A lockable pass-through to the main part of the home is usually included. With this, homeowners can lock the door on their side to prevent the renters from entering. Most remodels of this nature include a separate exterior door so that renters can enter their apartment without going through the main house.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Living quarters for self or family</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Garages are often remodeled to provide living quarters for elderly parents, friends, or children. In many cases, this apartment has the same facilities as does an apartment for renters. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">
<h4><span class="s1">Dedicated entertainment or work area</span></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your garage remodel may create a single room or multiple rooms for a specific purpose. The remodeled garage may become an entertainment room, home movie theater, gym, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office, workshop, or studio</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel costs in Nashville</span></h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Garage remodel permits alone can cost $1,000 to $1,500. For a simple living-room space that does not include plumbing, the cost will begin in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. Most of this cost is devoted to outfitting the space with a floor and filling in the garage door.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">More often, though, garage remodels intended as living quarters begin at $20,000 and rise sharply.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Garage remodel process and timeline</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Before you speak to a contractor, decide on the primary function for the remodel. A basic family or living room can be a relatively simple project since plumbing may not be involved. A full-scale rental apartment will be more expensive and will take several weeks or months.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After you’ve <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received multiple estimates</a> and chosen your contractor, discuss if any Nashville overlay and zoning issues need to be considered.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">You will meet with the contractor and an architect. The architect will draw up plans. The contractor applies for permits.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">After a roll-off dumpster is delivered to the property, workers demolish parts of the interior of the garage. The garage door is removed.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters fill in the empty space where the garage door was located. Usually, this will be an exterior wall system, complete with insulation and perhaps even windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Depending on the plan, workers may need to frame the floor with joists. This will raise the floor to the height of the main house’s floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">With the walls open, electricians and plumbers run wire and pipes through the walls.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Carpenters frame the interior walls and the ceiling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Workers add a heating and cooling system.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Drywall installers hang and finish the drywall.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Floor installers add the floor covering of your choice on top of the subfloor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">A painting team will paint the inside of the garage remodel. They will also paint areas outside of the garage, in front.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s1">Plumbers finish installing bathroom fixtures. Electricians complete the rest of the wiring.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">How a garage remodel affects house value</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">One important consideration before starting a garage remodel is whether it will increase the value of your home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you are considering a garage remodel in Nashville, you might be thinking of immediate, personal needs. Your family may be increasing in size. Or you may have elderly parents who need housing. In either case, remodeling your garage may represent a lower net financial cost than building a separate structure or buying a new house.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">On the other hand, if you do intend to eventually sell your home, consider how the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garage remodel will affect your home’s value</a>. Potential home buyers may view the lack of vehicle storage as a deficit. Other buyers may welcome the extra space.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Permits and restrictions</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City of Nashville requires a building permit for any new building or a modification of an existing structure. You must also have permits for individual tradework, such as for electrical, plumbing, or HVAC work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nashville is a city of many historic structures. The Nashville Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission (MHZC) was formed to protect Nashville’s architectural styles and character. If your home is located in a historic preservation and historic landmark overlay, you must apply for a Preservation Permit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">MHZC permit applications require a full set of plans, elevations, photos, and more. After you submit the permit application, the MHZC will meet to consider your project. After a permit is approved, you must stick to the conditions of the permit. For example, the MHZC will impose penalties or injunctions if the garage siding does not match that of the rest of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Nashville and Davidson County, neighborhood leaders and government officials take a close look at Airbnb-type rentals. These types of rentals are called Short Term Rental Properties (STRPs). The Metro Codes Department must approve of your rental property before you list it as an STRP (but not before you build it).</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Heat and cool your garage remodel in Nashville</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">With Nashville’s extremes of heat and cold, you should add a heating or cooling system to your garage remodel. Generally, there are three options:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Continue with the main house’s HVAC system. Workers continue the ductwork from the main house into the garage. The main house’s HVAC system must be adequate to handle the increased loads. This option works well when remodeling a garage for a living or family room: one that will flow seamlessly from the main house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">Install a separate HVAC system. This is the best option when remodeling a garage as living quarters. It is also the costliest option.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li6"><span class="s3">The lowest cost installation option is heating in the form of baseboard or wall heaters. For cooling, install one or more window or wall unit air conditioners. Installation is less expensive but the cost of service is higher. This is because baseboard heaters, wall heaters, and window unit A/Cs are less efficient than HVAC systems.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Where to park your vehicles</span></h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When reviewing permit applications for garage remodels in Nashville, the city will want to know where the displaced vehicles will go. Like most large cities, Nashville wants to reduce the number of cars that are street-parked.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have a paved driveway, the solution can be as simple as moving the cars to the driveway instead of in the garage. This is the lowest cost solution, though your vehicles will be left out in the open.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">If you have ample room in the front of your property, you may wish to build a carport or even a new garage. This will completely or partially protect the vehicles. It also may appeal to future buyers. Zoning issues may come into play since a 20-foot setback in front must be maintained. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">A garage remodel is a lower-cost alternative to building an addition but it is not low-cost. Think of a garage remodel as an investment in your home’s value and in your happiness.</span></p>

<h3>Get summer-ready</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone who lives in Dallas knows about its legendary heat. March and April’s fair days in the 70s are nice but they never continue. Average maximum temperatures in Dallas in July and August hit a whopping 96 degrees F. Your air-conditioner is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest contributor to your energy bill</a> in the summer. </span><span class="s1">While your own house will rely on that on the hottest days, Sweeten presents other avenues to supplement the A/C. Alternatively, t</span>he best way to cool a house includes utilizing energy-efficient exterior materials from the roof to the windows.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these changes will help you prepare your home from Dallas’ extreme heat. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Install a whole-house fan</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One way to assist your air-conditioner or even replace its operation on less intense days is with a whole-house fan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In your house, the lower areas below the attic are artificially conditioned to a set temperature, often in the low 70s F. As the day progresses, your unconditioned attic builds up heat. By the end of the day, it is at its hottest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though your attic may be insulated, a tremendous amount of heat has built up. The lower areas’ air-conditioning is working overtime to fight against it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A whole-house fan draws air through open windows and pushes it out through the roof. The attic is completely ventilated, as well. Many whole-house fans have an air exchange rate of up to six times the volume of the house.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speak with your contractor about the possibility of modifying the existing ducts of your HVAC system to provide whole-house cooling.</span></p>
<h3>Best way to cool a house: Choose energy-efficient exterior materials</h3>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Paint your home with lighter colors</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of us learned in school that lighter colors absorb less heat than dark colors. To a limited degree, the same idea applies to your home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The U.S. Department of Energy has found that dark-colored homes absorb up to 70 to 90 percent of the radiant energy that strikes the house from the sun. Heat on the outside of the house can transfer to the inside, resulting in heat gain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Does this mean that you should paint your house white? If you wish to, you should do so. But any type of lighter-colored paint or siding color will considerably reduce heat absorption. These are creams and ivories, light tans, beiges, blues, and pastels such as peaches, lavenders, and greens. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Choose roofing materials that handle the sun</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Roofs bear the brunt of the Dallas sun. Selecting the right type of roof can reduce heat. Up to one-third of the heat that builds up in a house comes through the roof.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One common misconception is that selecting a lighter-colored roof will do the trick. Not so: a study by the U.S. Department of Energy found that even white composite shingles absorbed 70 percent of the solar radiation. Essentially, the roof is blasted with so much solar radiation, that the selection of color alone will do little.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One lower-cost solution is to have a coating applied to the shingles. Containing glass fibers and aluminum particles, this coating wards off radiant energy to a degree that lighter-colored shingles cannot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More effective, though, is to choose a type of roof material that is less thermally reactive. Terra cotta and ceramic tiles, concrete tiles, and slab concrete are good choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even metal roofs are good choices due to their built-in dead-air space. This space acts as a thermal barrier to block heat transference to the house below.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Choose a siding that beats the heat</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The better insulated your home is against the heat, the cooler it will be inside. While in-wall and ceiling insulation are important, siding also will prepare your home from Dallas’ extreme heat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vinyl siding typically leaves a space between the siding and the house. Insulated vinyl siding fills that hollow space with a rigid foam plastic insulation. This insulation is permanently attached to the back of the siding. All insulated vinyl siding products must have an R-value of 2.0 or more. </span><span class="s1">R-value is a unit of measurement for thermal resistance. Higher R-value numbers mean greater insulating efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Masonry siding products such as brick and veneer stone help protect your home from the heat. Fiber-cement siding contains a great quantity of mineral materials, too. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Add continuous exterior insulation</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You cannot have enough insulation when battling the heat. While walls have been insulated internally for decades, a newer form of insulation adds even more of that much-needed R-value. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By itself, continuous insulation falls mid-range in terms of R-values—8.5 is considered typical for 2-inch thick continuous insulation. By comparison, standard two-by-four wall systems usually receive R-13 insulation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the real benefit lies in its name: continuous. Continuous insulation severs those thermal bridges that draw hot air into the home. Wall studs or any materials that extend from the outside to the inside through the walls can act as thermal bridges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It only takes one view through a thermal imaging camera while standing outside on a hot day. Before continuous insulation, telltale blue ribs indicate the stud thermal bridges. After continuous exterior insulation, those blue lines disappear and your cool air stays inside your house.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Buy the best windows for Dallas’ heat</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wall systems that are fully insulated are always the best way to prepare your home from Dallas’ extreme heat. But no one wants to live in a house with no windows. Instead, buy the best possible window for that wall opening:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Double-paned windows are standard, no matter where you live. For maximum heat protection, choose triple-paned windows.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Look for windows filled with Argon gas.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Choosing low-e (low emissivity) glass is considered a must in hot climates. Low-e is a coating that blocks much of the ultraviolet and infrared light from the sun. By controlling these two types of light, you control the passage of heat into the house.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Get your numbers straight. For hot climates, keep an eye on three numbers listed on the window’s sticker: U-Factor, SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient), and VT (Visible Transmittance). You will want a low U-Factor number, a low SHGC number, and a high VT number.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your exterior or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Install and maintain roof vents</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A whole-house fan pulls hot air from the entire house, including the attic, and expels it. Roof vents expel only air from the attic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ventilated attics can be as much as 30 degrees F cooler than unventilated attics. Chances are good that your home already is ventilated, and most newer homes are. The question is whether those vents are adequate for your needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For homeowners, calculating the number and size of needed roof vents can be difficult. Factors such as the presence of a vapor barrier, roof slope, type of roof, insulation, and more come into play. A qualified professional such as a roofing contractor can help with calculations and with installing the roof vents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your home has a vaulted or cathedral-style ceiling or a flat roof, you will have no attic. With these types of roofs, ventilation works differently: the open plenum is within the roof itself. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">More ways to keep your house cool in extreme</span><span class="s1"> heat</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Install exterior awnings over windows that receive the brunt of the sun during the hottest part of the day<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Install ceiling fans in each room. Note that ceiling fans rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. During the summer, you will want the ceiling fan to turn counter-clockwise.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Have your yard landscaped to add trees and shrubbery on the sunny side of your house<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Add thick thermal draperies to your windows<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many ways to keep your house cool in extreme heat, from changes to the house siding and windows and the attic. Whether upgrading your whole house or adding some supportive cooling elements, taking action will endure your summers are comfortable for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">—</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Atlanta housing market is humming. The value of homes increased by over seven percent in 2019, according to data from <a href="https://www.redfin.com/city/30756/GA/Atlanta/housing-market"><span class="s2">Redfin</span></a>. It’s one of those American city’s that is revitalizing with the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/03/30/atlanta-population-soars-by-730-000-now.html"><span class="s2">fourth-fastest growth rate</span></a> in the nation. As a result, Atlanta homeowners are increasingly planning for home improvements. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">If you’re thinking of prepping your house for sale, Sweeten outlines the top home improvements for the Atlanta market to get the best price and sell quickly. </span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes renovations aren’t always about what you want but what the homeowner who comes after you might want. A good idea is to take a look at the style of spec homes. “They try to use elements that have a large appeal,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6763#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Lonny</a>, who is based in Atlanta. When looking at the styles around Atlanta for your home improvements, sticking with what’s popular is best for resale rather than involving your unique preferences. “There might be hundreds of choices for faucets, but 95 percent of people might go with three styles,” said Lonny. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Renovation projects to consider: </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Change out the front door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First impressions endure when selling your home. “It is crucial that your entranceway is well kept,” said Lonny. Sprucing up the front of your home could be as simple as adding a new front door. For one client, Lonny swapped out a plain door for a craftsman-style door along with matching shutters. “It really set the house apart,” he said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. A fresh coat of paint </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6767#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Justin</a> advises homeowners to think like makeup artists when accessing the front of their home ahead of a sale. “You’re not going to attract buyers if the windows are fogged up and the paint is chipping,” he said. Ensuring your house is clean and your paint fresh will go a long way in getting the best price, Justin said. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Replace the garage door</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with your actual front door, replacing your garage door is a quick and easy fix to improve your home’s value. A garage door replacement costs $3,663 on average for the Atlanta area, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. Your home’s value is increased by more than 76 percent of that cost. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Invest in siding</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lonny often gets calls about siding replacement from homeowners who are planning to sell their home. New siding is a great investment, according to the 2020 Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. A project that installs fiber-cement siding costs an average of $17,000. Over $13,000 or 78 percent of the project’s cost is returned to you in the value that it adds to the home. That’s one of the highest returns on investment of any renovation project, according to the report. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Basement as living space</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basement is the first thing Justin looks at if a client is planning to resell their home. An unfinished basement has the potential to significantly <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the square footage of your home</a>. “Finishing your basement is going to yield the largest return on your investment,” said Justin. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other alterations, such as a kitchen or bathroom remodel, are helpful, but they don’t add to the size of your home like a basement can. The square footage of your home and its price per square foot will feature prominently in your home’s sale listing. Depending on how many floors you have, a finished basement could almost double that square foot measurement.</span></p>
<p>A full basement renovation that includes budget-friendly floors, paint, lighting, and a half bath can start at $20,000. &#8220;<span class="s1">On the conservative side for finishes, a turn-key basement will cost around $50-65 per square foot to finish out,&#8221; said Justin. &#8220;This includes a small kitchen area and basement bathroom if all the rough-in plumbing is already installed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to the Cost Vs Value </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/">report</a>, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he average cost of a basement remodel in Atlanta was $70,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This increases a home’s value by $46,000 or more than 65 percent of the renovation’s cost, the report found.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">6. The bathroom adds value</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving your bathroom a makeover is an easy route to a higher house price. Recently, a real estate agent contacted Lonny with a house about to go on the market. To increase its value ahead of the sale, Lonny completed a modified gut renovation in the bathroom. “This was something that was needed because it was dated from the 1980s,” said Lonny. The customer had everything replaced except the cabinetry. The budget was about $20,000. A bathroom remodel in this budget range adds almost $13,000 —65 percent of the budget— to your home’s value, according to the Cost Vs Value <span class="s2">report</span> for Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t have the time for a major remodel, then simple superficial changes might be a better option. This could mean swapping outdated fixtures like faucets for something more modern, said Lonny. A new countertop on your vanity could also spruce up your bathroom with minimum effort.  </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">7. A streamlined kitchen refresh</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kitchens are the gathering place, a focal point for any home. A kitchen could also make or break your home’s value, according to Justin. Rather than doing a full renovation that involves the costly exercise of changing a layout, stick to a scaled-back renovation. “A new countertop, backsplash, and faucet can go along way,” said Lonny. “If there’s the budget for it then I also suggest lighting and flooring.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cabinets, especially if they are custom-built, can take up a huge chunk of a budget. For a renovation that is geared towards increasing value, Lonny advised keeping cabinets as is. That way the budget and timeline can be streamlined. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A minor kitchen remodel with a budget of $23,000 has a high return on investment of 73 percent, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a>. A minor kitchen remodel in this instance involves replacing only the front of your cabinets, sink, faucet and countertops while adding an energy-efficient cooktop, oven, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give your home a fresh and neutral slate. Curb appeal gets the potential buyer to enter the door. A conservative palette inside allows them to more easily see how they can make the home their own. Take these home improvement ideas into consideration and be one step closer to closing the deal.</span></p>

<p>Miami adheres to strict building codes when it comes to hurricane-proof homes. And with good reason. In 2019, the Atlantic Ocean, Miami’s neighbor, produced <a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 major storms.</a> Six of those were hurricanes. Below, Sweeten shares the best methods to prepare a house for a hurricane during an exterior renovation.</p>
<p>A hurricane-proof renovation is in the best interest of your biggest investment (your home). New structures in Miami must be able to withstand wind of up to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article219862625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">175 miles per hour</a>. That can mean impact windows, additional straps to hold down your roof, and a few other strategies. Sweeten, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, offers a guide on how to prepare a house for a hurricane.</p>
<p>Not only can these standards save your home in a hurricane, but a hurricane-proof exterior renovation can further <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase your home’s value</a>. Homes that go beyond the code to withstand strong hurricanes sell for seven percent more than homes that don’t, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/how-to-build-a-hurricane-resistant-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s what to consider to prepare a house for a hurricane:</p>
<h3>Impact windows</h3>
<p>Impact windows will be your biggest expense to prepare your house for a hurricane. These specialty windows have multiple layers of silicone-coated glass. The windows are framed by sturdy material such as aluminum. Building codes require homes within a mile of the coast to have impact windows or shutters.</p>
<p>Replacing your windows with something that is hurricane-proof can cost $10,000 to $15,000, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Jose</a> said. That’s for a two-bedroom house that includes a glass-sliding door. “They aren’t cheap, but in Florida it is normal,” he said. It’s also best to plan ahead, not when a hurricane is on its way. Ordering impact windows can take five or six weeks to arrive, Jose said.</p>
<h3>Panels and shutters</h3>
<p>Shutters and panels that cover your windows during a hurricane are a low-cost alternative to impact windows (of course, you can always do both). The materials typically cost less and so does the installation.</p>
<p>Storm panels are the best value option. You attach them ahead of a hurricane and remove them after. This means a minimal impact to the look of your home. Panels cost between $7 and $8 per square foot, according to <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-hc-shutterguide-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sun Sentinel. </a>With this option, bolts or tracks are permanently attached around the windows. When a storm is on the way, the homeowner fastens the panels to the bolts or tracks. This takes about 15 minutes per window, according to the Sun Sentinel.</p>
<p>Roller shutters are permanently attached to your home but the installation is incognito until a storm comes. There are a few different styles, but roller shutters are the most common. They cost $30 to $55 per square foot, according to the Sun Sentinel. The shutters hide above the windows all year round. Like a garage door, they are pulled down for a hurricane. It’s easy, and your entire home can be prepped in minutes.</p>
<h3>Reinforced walls</h3>
<p>The benefits of shutters and impact windows are muted if your walls are weak. Older homes can face this issue, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. “It is possible the structural support around the doors and windows are not able to handle the wind load,” he said.</p>
<p>An older home built in the 1930s that Adrian worked on had hollow concrete around the doors and windows. To strength those walls, he had to pour concrete into the hollow areas. This added five days to the project timeline and about $3,000 to the budget. However, this is a good practice to consider during an exterior renovation.</p>
<h3>Doors should swing out</h3>
<p>This isn’t a minor issue. Whether your exterior doors swing in or out has a big impact on a hurricane-proof home. Once your exterior —doors or windows— is breached by a storm, it puts pressure on your roof and walls.</p>
<p>Normally, the only thing stopping an exterior door from flying off is the lock and hinge. “If you make the hinges so the door swings outside the home, it gives the door more resistance to wind,” said contractor Adrian. In High-Velocity Hurricane Zones like Miami-Dade county, the building code requires external doors to swing out.</p>
<h3>Fitting roof straps</h3>
<p>Your roof is a vulnerable part of your home in a hurricane. If your roof goes, chances are there won’t be much left of your walls or possessions either. Attaching straps made from galvanized steel between the wall plates and trusses is the most common path to a hurricane-proof home.</p>
<p>Retrofitting an older home with straps is ideally done when you’re already in the throes of an exterior renovation. Adding a new roof could cost $40,000. Adding straps takes up about five percent of that budget, Jose said, “If you’re not redoing your roof, then just adding straps isn’t a simple or cheap process,” he said.</p>
<h3>A hurricane while renovating</h3>
<p>This sounds like a terrible combination, but discuss the details with your contractor. Double-check the logistics if you’re intending to renovate in or around hurricane season, said Jose. Between your existing home insurance and your licensed contractor’s insurance (the keyword <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is licensed</a>), your home and new materials awaiting to be installed should be covered, according to Sweeten contractor Jose.</p>
<p>As a hurricane approaches, your contractor should be removing or securing materials and packing up tools. Flying debris during a storm needs to be under control.</p>
<p>If the glass has not been installed in the windows, then they will need a plywood cover. A piece can go for as much as $100, according to Jose. “People take advantage of the situation and price gouge,” he said.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the hurricane, expect your project timeline to extend by a week. The additional time for the project means more costs for dumpster hire, porter potty hire or storage costs, even if there is no damage to the property or materials, Jose said.</p>
<p>The strength and frequencies of big storms are increasing. Hurricane-proofing your home when you are doing a renovation will protect your biggest asset. Sweeten is here to help you navigate this process.</p>

<p>In a renovation journey that often starts with Pinterest boards for inspiration, the process to get to your dream space is exciting. It’s not without its twists and turns with something unexpected (the good and the bad). With safety and function in mind, this is the right time to make your home the way you want it. It’s good planning to have an idea of where hidden renovation costs may come up &#8211; from outdated wiring to soil stability.</p>
<p>These unseen bumps can increase the cost of your project and the time it takes to finish. Preparation can help with the hurdles. Atlanta general contractors from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, tell us what hidden renovation costs in Atlanta to watch for.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: Upgrading electrical and plumbing</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There was a time for all cities where building renovations and new construction went unregulated. That meant no permits, no code of ethics, no insurance and no need to follow building codes. “People would hire someone solely based on price,” explains <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6745#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Kimberly</a> on how Atlanta construction once worked. A licensed contractor could do a job at a certain cost, “but an uncle’s friend can do it for $30.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta didn’t really button this all up tightly until about two decades ago. “Before that, there wasn’t much to hold a contractor’s feet to the fire,” Kimberly said. That means plenty of surprises when walls, floors, and ceilings of older homes open up. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A project Kimberly had worked on in an upscale neighborhood had live wires in the ceiling that connected to nothing. “It literally could have set the house on fire,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These unforeseen problems can add to the cost of the project as well as the timeline. In another project, Kimberly’s client wanted an open plan living room and kitchen. Walls were removed. Once the demo started, the team discovered a drain stack inside one of the walls. The plumbing rerouted to add a week to the project’s timeline and about $4,000 to the cost. But these electrical and plumbing updates “will last forever until the next remodel,” she said. “</span><span class="s2">Each update has to follow the most current code at that time.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Abating lead and asbestos </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s safe to assume that any home built before 1978 in Atlanta will have lead paint and asbestos. That’s unless the poisonous materials were removed at some stage. The US banned lead paint in 1978. It wasn’t until the late 1980s that building materials could no longer contain asbestos. The material is now federally regulated in Atlanta.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before beginning a project on an older home, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6670#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dexter</a>, who is based in Atlanta, always tests for both of these substances. Handheld x-ray devices detect lead paint even if it is buried under layers of safe paint. Lead dust can also show up in swab tests that take a few days to process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos can be found in paint, flooring, pipes, insulation, fireproof materials, and wiring. It can show up in dust samples. To isolate where the asbestos is located, samples of the materials previously mentioned are sent to a lab. Contractors need a specific license to test for either lead or asbestos. Some contractors, like Dexter, are licensed to do a small amount of lead testing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What if lead or asbestos is found in your home? Either just the area you are disturbing (if it’s a smaller project) or your entire home will need to be abated. A licensed company should do the abatement. “I’ve seen homes abated and it took two to three weeks,” said Dexter. This can increase your costs by a few thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“There is also an option to leave the asbestos where it’s found and left undisturbed,” he said. Despite the time delay and extra costs, “clients have a peace of mind knowing this has been abated properly,” said Dexter. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Soil conditions in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation costs start to show themselves when your project messes with Atlanta&#8217;s waterways, ridges, soils, and rock beds.</span><span class="s1"> Setting foundations in soil too soft can mean big issues later on as your deck or extension settles and shifts. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order to complete an outdoor deck for a client, Kimberly drilled down triple the distance that was in the initial plan. At six feet, “the soil was gray indicating there was water there,” she said. The crew drilled down to 18 feet before they found soil suitable for the deck’s foundation. “It was an additional $12,000,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have the space, consider that building an outdoor deck increases your living square footage. A typical wood deck addition will return 63% of your investment, and a 73% return on investment for composite material, according to Remodeling’s Cost vs Value 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/"><span class="s3">report</span></a>. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Tree removal permits in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the City of Atlanta, removal of any tree with a trunk larger than 6” in diameter for hardwoods and 12” in diameter for pine requires <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/city-planning/office-of-buildings/arborist-division"><span class="s3">approval</span></a>. An arborist from the city will inspect the tree and then issue a permit if it passes. It is tightly regulated to minimize the loss of a mature tree canopy. “Atlanta was a forest before it was a city,” said Sweeten expert Kimberly. “They are trying to keep clean air quality.” </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If trees need to be removed, a well-thought-out site plan should show the trees and house and how its presence affects the future design. An explanation for why it needs to be removed is helpful. “There are a variety of permits issued by the City of Atlanta for tree removal,” said Kimberly, including it’s dead, diseased, or in a hazardous location.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The fee to remove a tree starts at $130. This money goes into the city’s Tree Trust Fund, which plants new trees and maintains existing ones. If your application to remove a tree for a renovation is denied, the plans will need to be modified. She suggests to apply for the tree removal permit first, otherwise your contractor will apply for it along with the building permit. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Hidden renovation cost: </span><span class="s1">Permits in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Atlanta is <a href="https://patch.com/georgia/atlanta/atlanta-named-8th-fastest-growing-large-city-america-study"><span class="s3">ranked 8th </span></a>in the United States for its growth rate amongst other large cities. That means a lot of new construction and renovations on existing homes as new owners move in. With so many permit applications for the Atlanta buildings department to process, the approvals can be unpredictable coming in as little as one day or 30 days for the same permit, according to Kimberly. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It puts a damper on the timeline for homeowner and contractor,” she said. Having a design-build firm, general contractor, or an architect come early on in the process helps ensure complete documentation is ready for the permit application process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whatever complexities lay ahead in a renovation, understanding and preparing for hidden renovation costs common to Atlanta is a good starting point. Luckily, Sweeten can help you find the right vetted general contractor in Atlanta! You’ll be one step closer to your dream home. Enjoy the journey.</span></p>
