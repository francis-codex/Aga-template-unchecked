<p class="p1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg" alt="Image of smart home technology in a shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home technology is everywhere today. It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech’s skill at automation, it’s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2020/January-February/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology"> <span class="s2">70-percent of homes</span></a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters and controllers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don’t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you’ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters connect to your home’s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater’s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there’s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart connected appliances</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do all of your home’s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips"> <span class="s2">EnergyStar</span></a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a two-part system. One, you’ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you’ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EnergyStar’s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home security systems</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, “smart” was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart radiant wall heating</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system’s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you’d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water monitors</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home’s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home’s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart garage door openers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.</span></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.</p>

<p>Seemingly minor design changes can shift a room&#8217;s entire aesthetic. Case in point: black window frames. They not only act as a frame to a picture-perfect outdoor view but also dress up a plain wall. Take a look at these six Sweeten projects to see how the homeowners incorporated black window frames into a variety of homes.</p>

<h3>Small-space solution: Black-framed windows</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg" alt="studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46927" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Black-framed window trim made this studio apartment look bigger and brighter. During her Sweeten renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-hand-me-down-co-op-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taylor decided on painting the window frames black</a> for a striking effect. This design idea brought a modern and elegant look to her 320-square-foot home.</p>
<h3>Interior window frames upgrade a townhouse</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23.jpg" alt="White living room with curtains on french window and a blue couch after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50805" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-bronx-rowhouse-remodel-for-work-life-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve and Lewis created several windows with black frames</a>. From the inside and the exterior, the unique configuration would add character to their renovated townhouse. The framed windows visually connect the urban activity outside.</p>
<h3>Painting window frames black adds charm to a Tudor</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="farmhouse-sink-with-granite-counter" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-49205 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg" alt="Blue and white bathroom with long double sink and glass shower door after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meredith-BathroomKitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Classic black-painted window frames fit all styles from apartments to older houses. Sweeten homeowner and interior designer <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith knew black trim would make the mark</a>. She noted how “they fit the Tudor style of the house perfectly.” The finished window acts as a visual anchor for the bathroom.</p>
<h3>Dark window framing complements intricate detail</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25574 size-full" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="Brooklyn brownstone" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry went with deep bluish-black molding</a> for their dining room area. The contrast emphasized the intricate stained glass.  “We love this room,” Nazli said, explaining how it was the main reason they bought the house.</p>
<h3>A Brooklyn home with black window frames</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-32884 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04.jpg" alt="brownstone renovation, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak replaced all the windows in their house</a>, creating an entirely new view. Painted black-framed windows invite the outside in. With this integral detail, these homeowners were able to create a timeless look that appeals to the eye.</p>
<h3>Bringing the outside in</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-44960 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alicia-sunroom-4.jpg" alt="home addition sunroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alicia-sunroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alicia-sunroom-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alicia-sunroom-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alicia-sunroom-4-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Black-framed windows highlight expansive light in a 1932 Dutch Colonial. These <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners added a 280-square-foot sunroom</a> off their kitchen. A wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor set of glass doors set the stage for a grand picture window to the outdoors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This apartment would benefit from a soft, bright palette of materials to  keep the rooms, which receive most of their light from the back  windows, light and airy.</p>
<p>I would start by painting the walls and ceiling in an off-white color and installing a durable, light-colored flooring material throughout.  Maple and bamboo are both good choices.  With a natural stain and light varnish the fine grain of these woods shows through and they&#8217;re easy to clean.  A simple wood base of the same material wood will give the walls a neat finish.  The new wood doors, door frames, and window frames would be finished to match.  For the kitchen I&#8217;d use cork floor tiles, which are soft to stand and work on, modern maple cabinets, and dark countertops.  For the bathroom I&#8217;d stick to traditional white ceramic fixtures, and use black and white ceramic tiles on the wainscot and floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="174" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FLOORING-540-300x97.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>A cream- and honey-colored palette for furniture complements the wood flooring and also adds warmth.  Contemporary pieces that stand up off the floor keep things feeling light and airy. I&#8217;d mix in a few more substantial pieces too, perhaps a coffee table from reclaimed wood, or an old-fashioned upholstered sofa.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FURNITURE-540-02-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Full-height sheer white curtains along the back wall will provide privacy while letting in lots of light.  I&#8217;d use simple bulb-shaped ceiling mounted light fixtures, and hang a special, more ornamental one above the main living or dining area.  Darker colored wool rugs or sisal mats can soften the living areas and pull seating arrangements together.  Brightly colored pillows, wall hangings and throws will add depth and cheer to the rooms.  Red, orange and brown would all be strong accent colors.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="343" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TEXTILES-540-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This apartment is going to make a stylish, comfortable  home for someone.  I can&#8217;t wait for her to come in and start sweetening!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>
