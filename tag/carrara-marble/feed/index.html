<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The names are similar, and the products are even quarried from the same region. Yet Carrara and Calacatta marble are so different, that you won’t ever mistake the two once you see them side-by-side. Carrara and Calacatta marble are highly valued as building products in bathrooms, kitchens, and in other areas of the home. </span>To help clarify the distinction between these two Italian marbles, Sweeten lays out the pros and cons of Carrara vs. Calacatta, and why you might choose one over the other.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carrara vs Calacatta Marble: What are they?</span></h3>
<h4>Carrara marble</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble is an off-white or blue-gray softly veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Historically, Carrara marble can be seen in statues and in large public and commercial buildings. However, Carrara marble is now more commonplace in residential homes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The core, or field, of Carrara marble is light-gray, with vague bluish tones. The streaks, called veins, are light-gray, too. The veins are slightly darker than the field. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The veins found in Carrara marble are subtle, not pronounced. Instead, they are soft, watery, or feathery. Carrara marble veins seem to continue and dissipate into the field.</span></p>

<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is a type of Carrara marble. It comes from the same overall region of Tuscany, Italy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble tends to have a white field. Usually, the whiter the field, the more expensive the marble.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The feature that distinguishes Calacatta marble is its veining. Calacatta’s veins are thick, bold, defined, and often colorful. Calacatta marble’s veins range from dark-gray and beige up to darker browns and even gold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta has few veins, but those veins stand out in sharp contrast to the white field.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Should you choose Carrara or Calacatta marble?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners who desire the overall look of marble, but want a more understated look, should choose Carrara marble. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Carrara marble does an excellent job of blending into the room as a whole rather than calling attention to itself. Because Carrara takes more of a backseat, it can be used across large expanses for walls and flooring.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble is for homeowners who want to show off this unique, gorgeous stone. It’s a marble that truly looks the way marble should look.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because Calacatta marble is all about its veins, it is well-suited to bookmatching. Bookmatching pairs two marble slabs from the same cut so that adjacent slabs mirror each other. This gives the appearance of an open book. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Calacatta marble’s distinctive veins make bookmatching possible. With Carrara marble, you can bookmatch slabs, but the effect may not be evident.</span></p>
<h3>Calacatta vs Carrara Cost: Which is more expensive?</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nobody can call marble a &#8220;bargain&#8221; building material. However, Carrara marble is far less expensive than Calacatta marble; around half the price.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of marble</span></h3>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Pros</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Premium building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">High resale value<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Unique, every slab is different<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Natural building material<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Lasts long with proper maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Cons</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Expensive<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Soft, chips easily<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Heavy<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Stains<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Requires maintenance<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is marble popular?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All building materials have their trends. But <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/kitchens/a8981/cons-marble-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble’s popularity remains more stable</a> than other materials. In fact, no other material looks quite like it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For some homes, marble isn’t just the best choice, it’s the only choice. Marble is frequently the go-to pick for high-end houses with a classic or traditional style. It doesn’t hurt that marble’s history is rich and deep, as marble is associated with Roman buildings and classic sculptures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Functionally, marble is dense, heavy, and permanent. It resists heat well. It’s also more commonly found than one might think. Italy produces Carrara and Calacatta marble, but Spain, India, China, Turkey, Greece, and the U.S. also produce other types of marble.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Image of a bathtub with Calacatta marble walls" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></h3>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Best uses of marble in the home: </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><b></b>Kitchen counters: Use marble as your main kitchen countertop material.</li>
<li>Kitchen island counters: Pair the main kitchen counters with a slab of <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble on the kitchen island</a>. Or use marble alone here.</li>
<li>Kitchen or bathroom backsplashes: Marble works well for backsplashes in the kitchen (though not behind the stove) or behind the bathroom sink.</li>
<li>Entry or foyer hallways: Marble has long been used in foyers, lobbies, and other entry rooms as a show-stopper to welcome visitors.</li>
<li>Bathtub or shower surrounds: Marble is waterproof when sealed, making it a perfect fit for shower or bathtub wall surrounds.</li>
<li>Bathroom floor tile: Marble is a hardy floor covering for bathrooms, plus it stands up well to water.</li>
<li class="li3">Fireplace surrounds: Polished marble can be used for fireplace surrounds as it can be wiped clean.<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to clean marble and maintain it</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You should always seal marble used around the home. Keep the stone regularly sealed. When drops of water no longer bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Acidic liquids can etch marble. Avoid having vinegar, citrus, or tomatoes sit on the marble for very long. Clean them up quickly. Use cutting boards.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clean marble with gentle methods. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth. Look for a good cleaner designed just for marble. Never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on the marble.</span></p>

 <div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752036182"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is Carrara marble?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Carrara marble is a veined marble from the Apuan Alps in northwest Italy, near Carrara. Carrara marble was historically used for statues and public and commercial buildings, but in modern times, it is used in residential houses. Carrara marble is off-white or blue-gray in color, with streaks (or “veins”) of light gray which are slightly darker than the core color. The veins in Carrara are subtle, as opposed to the bold, deep veins found in Calacatta marble.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752049921"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How to clean Carrara marble</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Always clean marble with gentle methods–never use abrasive powders or abrasive materials on marble as the surface is soft and chips easily. Vacuum or sweep up crumbs or dirt. Every so often, use a damp mop or cloth using a cleaner designed just for marble. </p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752063615"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Carrara marble need to be sealed?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, Carrara marble needs to be sealed. Test whether you need to re-seal your marble by dropping beads of water onto its surface. If the water does not bead up on the surface, it’s time to seal the stone again.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639752078287"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Is Carrara marble good for bathroom vanity?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Carrara marble can be used as a bathroom vanity topper, as it stands up well to water, but needs to be maintained carefully. Since marble is a soft stone that etches and chips easily, avoid using abrasive materials or acidic liquids while cleaning its surface.</p> </div> </div> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/">The Difference Between Carrara and Calacatta Marble</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://sweeten.com">Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Repair a leak and update the look of a bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner bought her 1931 West Village studio co-op in 2013 and gut renovated the entire space—minus the bathroom. Recently, the building’s management let her know that there was a major leak behind the walls. Since a portion of the bathroom would have to be demolished to identify the source and then fix the leak, she decided to go through with a full gut renovation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was looking for a reputable and reasonably priced general contractor who would not only do a great job, but that I could fully trust and who would be flexible given the nature of the situation,&#8221; she shared. While resolving the issue and fixing the leak was the most important element of the project, the homeowner also wanted to make cosmetic changes to match the luxe, timeless, and high-quality feel of the rest of her renovated home.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-glass-doors"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48809 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom with glass doors before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tina-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span>: The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/32036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project to Sweeten</a> and received multiple matches and bids. When she met one of her matches in person and “thought he was too good to be true,” the homeowner requested references she could speak to directly. “His references described him as someone who was honest and trustworthy, hardworking, easy to work with, did high-quality work, and would do whatever it took to make a client happy,” she said. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matching with the general contractor</a>, she soon found out the references were spot on.</p>
<p>They tackled the renovation together, focusing first on repairing the leak and subsequent damage, and from there, honing in on the look and adding more storage. She consulted with a designer, <a href="https://www.damonliss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon Liss</a>, who helped out on her previous renovation, and he suggested where to go for materials. Ultimately the finishes were selected to be cohesive and consistent with the rest of the home. That meant lots of natural and marble stone, plus polished chrome hardware. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner went to the Kohler experience store and worked with a salesperson to select fixtures.</span> She gave up a bit of shower space to add in a bigger vanity and decided against centering the sink to maximize counter space.</p>

Throughout the experience, there were those expected, and otherwise, challenges that the general contractor helped her navigate. For example, when they waterproofed the shower to meet New York City code, the building engineer informed them that the building had a higher standard than the city. An additional layer of protection would be needed to meet the building’s standards. The general contractor quickly took action to make the necessary updates. He also stepped into conversations with suppliers to move things along and paid close attention to the project status throughout the process. The homeowner was particularly concerned about an involved renovation and construction process going on in the already-finished home. “My general contractor and his team took great care with my apartment, built trust quickly, and drove a high standard on all aspects of the project,&#8221; she shared.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the renovator did have to move out of her home for the project to be completed, her general contractor and his team made the whole process easy and manageable. “Even my building management and suppliers were blown away by his professionalism, work ethic, attitude, and quality of work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, I’m really happy with the result and how the process went,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I will only ever buy something that I can renovate,” the homeowner said. She loves the creative process, from picking materials to seeing the space come together.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Plans include an open kitchen, new closets, oak floors, and embracing the “cons” of Carrara marble</h2>
<p><i>A search for a home to suit their growing family led Marissa and Cody from the West Village to a beautiful spot in northern Manhattan. The apartment, a two-bed, one-bath corner unit, was located on a steep hill in the neighborhood of Hudson Heights. (Fun fact: the building’s foundation sits on a lattice of 40-foot steel stilts!) It came with soaring views of the city, gorgeous light from its north- and east-facing windows, and felt “more like San Francisco than New York City.” The unit’s interior needed some updating, and Cody, an architect, was up to the task. </i><span class="s1"><i>Paired up with a contractor from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors,</i></span><span class="s1"><i> they </i></span><i>knocked down a wall closing in the galley kitchen to connect it to the living room<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>creating an open kitchen design<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>removed a nib wall, and made changes to the bath as well as the floors and closets throughout.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cody says</span>: </i></span>We had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for seven years. We started looking to buy an apartment when Marissa became pregnant, and homed in on northern Manhattan to give her a reasonable commute to Columbia University (we had ruled out several neighborhoods in Brooklyn for this reason). Our first impression of Hudson Heights was that it felt like a small village tucked away in the city, surrounded by amazing views and parks. We visited on a snowy winter day, and saw a cross-country skier in the middle of the street!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We continued to look more seriously after our daughter, Lucia, was born, and finally closed on an apartment in March 2016: a two-bed, one-bath, 1,000-square-foot apartment in a 1960s co-op building. Though the postwar construction did not have some of the Art Deco, prewar detailing that is typical of the neighborhood, it did lend itself to a simple and logical floor plan and had thru-wall air conditioning units<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>allowing in even more light than apartments we saw with window units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marissa says</span>:</i></span> Cody is an architect, and we wanted something we could renovate and make our own. While continuing to live in our West Village apartment, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> to Sweeten and went with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> who was professional, communicative, and direct. The renovation took eight weeks (two weeks under the projected schedule the contractor proposed!), and we moved in just after he finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of our overall vision, first and foremost we wanted to join the kitchen to the living space. We hoped to make the apartment feel open, light, and modern, but warm and homey at the same time. We were drawn to a clean and minimal palette, especially in the kitchen. Cody is an avid home cook, and we knew the kitchen would be the heart of the home. We maximized where we could—for example, with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36-inch wide refrigerator</a>, five-burner range, 23-inch stainless steel undermount sink. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot island</a> is our home base, the place where we naturally gravitate throughout the day or when we have friends over.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26378 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shelves for cookbooks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related note, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA kitchen</a> cabinet system is amazing for the price point. There are an infinite number of modular configurations and we achieved a result that is nearly indistinguishable from a custom kitchen. The upper cabinets are 40 inches tall and extend to the ceiling, allowing for tons of storage (we never thought we would have empty shelves while living in NYC!). It was important for us to use “real” materials like stone and wood to accent specific moments. For example, we selected the white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> knowing full well it would take a beating. We loved the idea that every scratch, etch, and stain will continue to give it character over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="view from the kitchen into the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that an open kitchen design and living area was our primary goal, the first question we asked ourselves when viewing a potential apartment was: “Can we connect the kitchen to the living space?” The existing kitchen in our apartment was a long and narrow galley. Knocking down the wall allowed us to redesign the entire room, maximizing storage and functionality while linking the main living spaces. It also made the room much brighter<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the window in the kitchen brings in tons more light to the living and dining room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedrooms, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a> the floors with a lighter and more natural oak. We love how they seem to brighten up both spaces now. We also redid the closets in both rooms; in the master bedroom we were able to do the floor-to-ceiling pivot hinges, just like in the living space, but in Lucia&#8217;s room a beam prevented us from doing the same. We were still able to reframe her closet and maximize storage with a new shelving system. We also bought very minimal ceiling light fixtures for each room, which blend in while providing extra ambient light. All of that, plus the square-stock baseboards and door casings, really spruced up both rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26362 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26363 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26364 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also eliminated a small nib wall in the living room that separated the front living space from the bedrooms in the back of the apartment. With the nib wall gone, there is a direct line of sight to the windows in Lucia’s bedroom, which brightens the entire apartment and creates a feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26367 size-chrono" title="office nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 mb-0 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of the kitchen and living room project, we also saw the opportunity to reframe the closets throughout the apartment, remove the existing sliding bypass closet doors, and replace them with floor-to-ceiling pivot hinged doors. This created ample storage, and the verticality of the doors and their accompanying hardware became a design feature consistent in every room. The reconfiguration that resulted in an open kitchen design also allowed us to create a new hallway linen closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made a few changes to the bathroom which made a big difference in the final look. We replaced the pedestal sink for a wall mounted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> which created a lot more storage, replaced the old shower bypass glass doors with a fixed glass panel, and gave it a fresh coat of gray paint. We kept the tiles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting fixtures,</a> and towel racks from the previous design.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26370 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26371 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most surprising moment of the whole process was when our contractor sent us some photos after the first day of demolition. There was a huge pile of debris in the middle of the apartment, and a raw opening between the kitchen and living room and around each closet. Beams, columns, electrical conduit, and wiring were totally exposed. It was a shock to realize how much work we were really putting into the renovation. There was no turning back, and we could only hope that all the planning and design preparation going into the project would work out. Eight weeks later, it was a finished project and we could not have been happier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can’t recommend our Sweeten contractor enough. Although his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid</a> was slightly higher than the others we received, we immediately got the sense that he would deliver a high-quality product, not exceed his budget, and stick to his schedule. All of this turned out to be accurate. We felt most comfortable with him from day one. He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that there are many unknowns in the renovation process, and many pieces that are out of your control. Until we knocked down the wall between the living room and kitchen, we did not know for certain what would be behind it. (We had done a small probe to look for pipes, and based on the short span, we assumed that there were not any structural elements.) We couldn’t know for sure the location of the plumbing and gas risers until demolition was complete, which would ultimately dictate where we placed the kitchen sink and oven. It turned out that the gas riser was floating off the perimeter wall by almost 24 inches, and we had initially assumed it would be right along the perimeter wall. As a result, the opening to the kitchen had to be cut short. Although it was initially a disappointment, we used the 24-inch wall as an opportunity to put in a small cabinet and countertop, with wooden shelves above. It ended up being a great addition to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open kitchen design</a>, even though we hadn’t anticipated it!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our advice to future renovators: make your design choices ahead of time and stick to them. You don’t want to be redesigning in the middle of construction. If there are any surprises during construction (like the location of a gas riser<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>see above), it is critical to make a thoughtful yet quick decision and keep moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with the apartment. It turned out just as we had envisioned it, and it’s been great to have so much space! We had been living in a 600-square-foot one-bedroom for Lucia’s first year, and by the time we moved out, we were feeling very cramped. Now, we’re expecting our second baby, and it feels like there is plenty of room to grow. But if the day comes when we do need more space and we start looking for our next renovation project, we’ll certainly use Sweeten again!</p>
<p><i>What a thoughtful and beautiful redesign, Cody! Thanks to you, Marissa, and Lucia for a glimpse into your home. </i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A loft apartment rediscovers its historic roots by exposing its beams, maximizing 11-foot ceilings, and bringing the walls down</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Meg and Brett had grown comfortable with their rental—despite its tiny shower, inadequate climate control, and chronic water problems—but dreamed of something to call their own. Having searched for years without success, they finally landed on just the thing: a spacious loft apartment in Hamilton Heights with a history. They went to work restoring some of the industrial charm that previous owners had plastered over with drywall, and the result is a stunning combination of original wooden beams, salvage finds, and touches of warmth that make an apartment a home. Read on for Brett’s take on how he worked with Sweeten to create the ideal space for his growing family.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24990 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Hamilton Heights homeowner Brett</span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been renting in NYC in different neighborhoods for many years, including most recently, our rental of eight years at the corner of 63rd Street and 2nd Ave. We loved our rental, but it had its share of problems&#8230;it would heat up like an oven in the summer, and in winter, it was so cold we could see our breath in the living room. It flooded every other year, and we could hear honking almost 24/7. It was imperfect but it was comfortable, and we loved it. We thought about purchasing a place for many years, but every apartment we looked at was a step down from where we were. Then we found it…the perfect place in the perfect neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8230;after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment! </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we found was an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath condo loft in the historic district of Hamilton Heights. In an old carriage house that had been converted to residential lofts, the building was one of the few remaining carriage houses left in the city. We can track its existence back to 1903 from old ads in the Tammany Times, but I am sure it was built before then.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The place had been renovated not too long ago and was finished nicely. It had everything we ever wanted, and had we moved in as is, it would have been a huge step up from our current place. Most people would have moved in and not changed a thing. Our friends, our parents, and our brokers all thought we were crazy to even touch it. But after spending eight years with floods, water bugs, no air conditioning, warped floors, peeling paint, a fridge from the &#8217;80s, an oven from the ‘70s, and one tiny bath you didn’t want to set foot into…we wanted our dream apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as our vision was concerned, we wanted our loft apartment to feel high-end, but not stuffy or fancy. It should have a modern and clean feel to it, while still being classic and forever. We wanted to feel like we were on vacation when we were at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This place had a lot of history and interest to it, but we felt that the previous owner covered up a lot of the historical aspects, and aimed to expose them literally and figuratively. We describe it as smashing-a-modern-apartment-into-a-barn because that is kind of what we did. Attention wasn&#8217;t paid to trends, design rules, or motifs. We picked what we liked, and things that would be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love watching &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/t221YNSCFLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open House&#8221; NYC</a>, our normal weekend activity, and saw an ad for Sweeten come on. Knowing that work needed to be done on the place, we thought of this as a good sign and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/8578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed up on the site</a>. Looking through their bios and past work, we found a few contractors who we were matched with that we liked. After speaking to three on the phone, there was a good feeling with one Sweeten design/build firm. His pictures showed he could do nice work, and he seemed like a straight shooter. We met with him at his office and got a quote on the scope of work. My wife and I liked the Sweeten contractor and felt him to be honest. We never got another quote or met with another contractor. His price wasn’t cheap but I didn’t want cheap work. I wanted someone I knew would do the job right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered during this renovation that developers will often square things off and use preset sizes for things to make the job easier and cheaper. After we did some demo, we found a ton of extra storage space just behind the sheetrock in the kitchen—and built an 8-foot-tall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> into the wall to the left of the fridge. Don’t be afraid to knock a few holes in walls. It’s all going to be painted anyway. After all, ours ended up being floor-to-ceiling in the kitchen which rivals most suburban pantries. Lastly, we recessed all the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> except pendants over the peninsula, which we replaced with classic handblown Simon Pierce light fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the exposed brick in the living room—which had 11-foot-high ceilings—and looked to continue the theme. We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath. This method allowed us to find original beams and columns all over the apartment and expose them. The wooden beams were original to the carriage house, whereas the iron beams were installed to support the original structure at some point in the building’s history. Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood-burning fireplace was originally wrapped in an ugly stone, so we wrapped it in black steel and replaced the mantle with a natural soapstone. Behind the fireplace, we built a niche for all the electronics and hung a TV above the mantel. We stripped the yellow varnish off the wide-plank oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> throughout the loft apartment and refinished them with an eco-friendly, non-toxic, two-stage fuming process. The ceiling was painted the color of the sky—Benjamin Moore Grey Sky—and recessed LED lighting was added. A large custom table was built for the space by RE-CO Brooklyn from a single tree that fell during Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found the tall ladder in the boiler room of an old factory in the Bronx. I work for a company that owns a few buildings in Hunts Point, and there are generations of industries and companies that have come and gone in those buildings. In my downtime, I like to explore the old abandoned spaces. Sometimes you can find the coolest stuff if you aren’t afraid to get a little dirty. The ladder was blackened from the fumes and probably at least 40 years old. I sanded it down and now use it to reach for items and to add some vertical interest. For the plant hangers, I used various industrial parts I found at a supply store to create a way to attach and hang plants to the beam.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we went for a classic look: white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> with Carrara marble countertops and backsplash, with pulls and knobs in silver. The original kitchen cabinets had a shiny yellow wood finish that was not our style, so they were stripped down and painted in a nice white. Various sections were distressed to better fit the style of the loft apartment. The counters and backsplash are 3.5-inch-thick Carrara marble—the distributor said it was too hard to deliver and install such a thick piece in one slab because of the weight. But we insisted and they had to use 10 men to bring it in and install it! We also enlarged the sink with a Kohler stainless steel model. The range is a Bertazzoni Pro. Next to the sink is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-fridge</a> that is stocked with the same items you would find in a hotel mini-fridge—even things I don’t like!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, in the master bath, we went with a large 4-inch <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> in Carrara marble, with a simple white subway tile on the walls to match. I found our sink at an old steel warehouse in the South Bronx—it was filled with debris and pigeon poop at the time but was in surprisingly good shape. It’s a 48-inch Kohler slop sink circa 1948, and our Sweeten contractor was able to create a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> underneath to fit the unusual shape of the sink. Our contractor also custom-made the mirror above to match.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the kitchen, we found space behind walls in the bathroom and created three linen closets. This room also holds the thing that I’m most excited about in the whole renovation: the shower. It’s spacious and comfortable—I had to duck down to get into our old shower and I’m only 5’8” on a good day. My wife’s favorite thing about the entire renovation is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer</a>! I didn’t even have to ask what it was…at our old building, the washing machines looked so old, I swear they ran on steam power. Clothes would come out dirtier than when they went in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we redid the floor-to-ceiling closets with custom wooden doors and hid a TV inside. We also added custom wood shutters to the windows, which accentuate the unique shape of the windows. They are super deep, tall and arched. Without many good options, we concluded this was the best way to address the arch without ruining the architectural interest of the windows. As for the rest of the bedroom, it feels very serene and relaxing. Sleep is important to my wife and me, and we wanted it to feel like a retreat from the city. We didn&#8217;t want any industrial elements in here. We wanted it to feel refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the entire process, our Sweeten contractor stayed on budget, which was very important to us. He completed the project within the time frame we discussed, even though I kept adding more and more work. He was pleasant to work with and fixed every concern or problem I brought up. Even after the project was complete, he repeatedly checked in and fixed a problem or two that was missed during the renovation. Now that we’re done, I’d say that the hardest part was staying on budget with a project of this scope. We kept finding more things that we wanted to do. My advice to future renovators is to anticipate this and to make a list of things that need to be perfect. Don’t be afraid to move backwards or sideways. Better to take your time, and get what you want than rush and end up with something subpar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21359 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21410 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-12-1-723x997.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="997" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21356 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>

</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When a design editor and curator came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate the kitchen and bathroom in her 1910 Greenwich Village industrial loft, we were psyched to see what she would do with the remnants of a 1970s condo conversion and eager to see how a design professional would (presumably) breeze through her own renovation. We most definitely did end up with a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom after we introduced this homeowner to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Aleks</a>, but we also landed some especially insightful lessons learned along the way. We&#8217;ll keep our source secret because she works in the industry, but here are three renovation lessons from a sweetened kitchen and bathroom that everyone should know.</p>
<p><a href="sweeten.com/kitchens/3-renovation-lessons-learned-from-a-greenwich-village-designer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14579" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg" alt="kitchen and bath renovation " width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3renovationlessons-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-14565"></span></p>
<h3>1. Visit the showrooms, but buy online.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insider tip from this renovation is that you have to combine high-tech and low-tech research methods to make decisions and purchases. Products are endlessly available from a huge variety of sources and it&#8217;s worth visiting showrooms and stone yards to see and touch the materials that will be in your home for years, but the best prices for most materials can be found online. Even with architect and designer discounts, this design pro found that most purchases were cheaper online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One potential downside of skipping the brick and mortar ordering experience is that you are dealing with a wide variety of sources across many appliances and fixtures. The word from our insider is to apply some good old-fashioned patience and diligence in dealing with different customer service contacts, but also take very clear pictures of labels and serial numbers and specs in case you need to correct an order or source any additional tiny parts. Keep your cool as materials arrive by cataloguing electronic records and photos of all of the pieces, with serial numbers visible in your photos, so that you can instantly source what you need as deliveries fall into place. These records will also help you document any problems you do run into with vendors and will give you a much clearer path to resolving issues big and small.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Learn your way around IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our industry source looked at lots of kitchen cabinetry options and found that the high-end route was astronomically expense. Frustratingly, the next tier down was slightly more budget-friendly, but not enough to mask the difference in construction quality. IKEA&#8217;s cabinet system required admittedly time-consuming weeknight trips and weekend excursions, but investing time and learning her way around their design software yielded a great set of cabinets and a modern look at a much lower price point. &#8220;Brace yourself and crack IKEA&#8221; in her words!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any order, you should have your contractor confirm measurements and weigh in on the pieces you pick before you order. Your contractor is your full partner in the renovation &#8211; even if you have the patience to teach yourself to use IKEA&#8217;s design system, your contractor will figure out ways to make things work and help you pass obstacles you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see coming.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stay close by and check in often.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re going with a major renovation and need to stay elsewhere while the work is underway, it&#8217;s really important to be close by and check in often. Even with all of the advance planning and ordering and designing that goes in to the process, there are decisions being made on the ground at every stage and you want to be a part of it. It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re supervising the work or preventing mistakes, it&#8217;s that there are small decisions and many paths that the team will go down, and you can have an impact as design translates into build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talk to your contractor about when visits make sense and be a regular thought partner in the progress. Our insider also encouraged renovators to be kind to themselves and to their contractors: be prepared for mistakes &#8211; the wrong color, the wrong size, and unforeseen adjustments are an inevitable part of a complex and custom process. Forgive yourself and build in the emotional and scheduling contingencies to address mistakes and keep moving forward.</p>

She credited Sweeten Expert Aleks and his team in bringing calm to the storm, suggesting realistic upgrades and solutions for custom adjustments and tight corners, and for being a welcome partner in day to day problem-solving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re back this week with a Brooklyn family of three to take a look at their complete bathroom renovation. Robyn and Alejandro took a personal approach to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovating the kitchen</a> in their Columbia Waterfront District condo and continued the overhaul in the bathroom with a mix of classic materials and an unexpected pop of color in two unconventional places. Like the kitchen, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the bathroom was beyond salvageable</a> when they found the place. Serious damage included peeling walls and temporary storage that could not withstand the room&#8217;s moisture. This project was a true family affair on both sides: we sent <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> to rip out the interior walls and replace all of the fixtures, and Paulina&#8217;s father, Andrzej, lent his considerable talents to help Robyn and Alejandro open up and modernize their bathroom with a trio of new tiles and a full set of whiz bang fixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-brooklyn-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-13608 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1.png" alt="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Brooklyn Bathroom Renovation – Sweetened!" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unnamed1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>&#8220;In all instances, Paulina came to the table with a small detail that ended up completely making the space work for us &#8211; just brilliant.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8211; Robyn, Brooklyn homeowner</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13598"></span>From the start, Robyn and Alejandro had a clear vision for an all-tile bathroom with frameless glass to separate the tub from the rest of the room without closing off the space. Initially, they assumed that a standard two-tile approach would be the way to go, but as the outdated bath was demolished and the space became a blank slate, they opted for a set of three different tiles in varying styles and materials and ran with a unique pop of powder blue for contrast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13604" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before.jpg" alt="bathroom before" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bathroom-before-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn chose beveled white porcelain subway tiles for the room&#8217;s upper half and incorporated Paulina&#8217;s suggestion to use natural stone tile to line the lower half. Large-format Carrera marble helps provide a transition from the crisp subway tile down to the grittier black cement hex tiles that Robyn chose for the floor and tub wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn felt drawn to incorporating a powder blue sink &#8211; this <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Iron-Bell-Vessel--above-counter-or-wall-mount-bathroom-sink-with-glazed-underside/productDetail/Vessel-Sinks/417732.htm?skuId=383924&amp;brandId=1011754&amp;isSeachPage=true&amp;pageName=globalSearch&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D40%26scrollTop%3D596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Vapour Blue oval basin</a> is a little bit of a throwback in an otherwise modern space. To continue that theme, Paulina created a custom frame to line the recessed, mirrored medicine cabinet with the same color pop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13605" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 01" width="600" height="881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-01-204x300.jpg 204w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13606" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 02" width="600" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-02-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robyn and Alejandro surveyed friends and family members as they considered how to make the tub as functional as possible and the verdict seemed clear: a whirlpool tub would be an expensive luxury that would probably go un-used. Despite the well-intentioned warnings, the couple forged ahead with the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Tea-for-Two-60-x-32-drop-in-whirlpool-with-reversible-drain-and-heater-without-trim/productDetail/Whirlpools/421977.htm?brandId=429646&amp;skuId=377900&amp;categoryId=429549&amp;hash=id%3Dfilters%26startIndex%3D20%26scrollTop%3D524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Tea-for-Two whirlpool tub</a> with reversible drains and a built-in heater. Happily, it has become a frequent and favorite personal retreat for each family member!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert designed and built the custom vanity with two roomy drawers (modeled in the same simple Shaker style they used for the kitchen cabinets) and topped it with a slim Carrera marble counter. To complete the look, Robyn went with a vintage-styled <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Artifacts-single-handle-bathroom-sink-faucet/productDetail/Sink-Faucets/870349.htm?brandId=999639&amp;categoryId=431602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Artifacts faucet</a> with a single lever handle and continued with a second set of polished <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/browse/bathroom-showering-tub-shower-faucets/_/N-2dulZ1z11u2i?brandNValue=4294877386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler Artifacts fixtures</a> for the shower as well as a polished chrome double swing-arm wall sconce light from <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/catalog/products/fords-mill-double-2-1-4in-pin-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rejuvenation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13607" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Robyn's Bathroom 03" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_Robyns-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
