It was a shell of a building that was in pretty bad shape. Although, it did have a simple layout and flow. The ceilings in the back room had low support rafters that made it difficult to appreciate the height of the roof.

For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p></div>

This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, the most common of these being bathrooms based on the number of patrons your property can hold. </p></div>

<p><em>Required exterior work of the New York residential building the Howard led to a decision by its board to add on much-needed renovations for the lobby as well as the lobbies of its two sister complexes. They tapped the architectural firm EDG for a modern overhaul giving all the spaces a greater aesthetic, comfort, and security. The firm came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting commercial renovators with vetted general contractors, resulting in lobbies remodeled with new amenities, low-maintenance materials, and an eye towards increasing homeowners’ investments.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT:</strong> Three residential building lobbies</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Rego Park neighborhood in Queens, New York</p>
<p><strong>RENOVATION TEAM:</strong> Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a>, and <a href="https://edgnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDG</a></p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEW WITH:</strong> Elsie Stark, Board President of the Howard Owners Inc., and architectural firm EDG</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43554" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richard-Lobbies-99_32-04.jpg" alt="residential residence exterior" width="1000" height="676" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richard-Lobbies-99_32-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Richard-Lobbies-99_32-04-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you tell us about your building?</p>
<p><strong>Elsie:</strong> Back in the early ‘50s, our buildings were residential luxury rentals built by the architect Philip Birnbaum, who designed many of the buildings in Forest Hills/Rego Park. The Howard is one of three complexes built named for the children of the builder Alfred L. Kaskel. The other two are the Anita and the Carrol which have the same footprint as The Howard. There are 485 units altogether.</p>
<p>They were the first fireproof buildings of steel and concrete without fire escapes. The simplexes, duplexes, and penthouses are incorporated like puzzle pieces rather than apartment lines. Elevators only stop on the odd-numbered floors of the 13-floor buildings. The Howard converted to a co-op back in the mid- to late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the renovation of these new building lobbies?</p>
<p><strong>EDG:</strong> The client was looking to update their lobbies and add real market value to their properties. They wanted to create a new identity for the buildings unifying the three properties. For the exterior, the original stone border was updated with cleaner lines, and we also installed new building signage using a modern enlarged font, which can now be read from the street.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Elsie:</strong> We were doing our Local Law 11 work and in the process, we found that we needed to address some issues with the entrance façade. Since we were going to go through extensive construction with the LL11 work, the board looked into modernizing the lobbies.</p>
<p>We had been dealing with repetitive repairs of outdated doors, intercoms, and other issues, so we looked into the cost and how it would improve services while raising the value of the building. This is always a tough undertaking for one building but for The Howard we are talking about three buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>EDG:</strong> For a main lobby, there was no real sense of a unique place and lacked any feeling of atmosphere. The existing materials and color palette were drab with uninviting lighting, giving the overall impression of a dated space.</p>
<p><strong>Elsie:</strong> The space before was neat, safe, and a bit boring. The Howard had done a renovation about 10 years prior but we did not use a designer or architect. The renovation was done in-house pulling down old wallpaper, painting, adding artwork, and sprucing up the old space.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What did the redesign achieve for the building and the homeowners?</p>
<p><strong>EDG:</strong> As the architect, we worked with the client to rehabilitate the exterior façade, the entire ground floor lobby, and the elevator cab interiors for all three residential buildings. We created a more vibrant space, using new textures and materials, like wood and stone, that would be timeless. The existing lobby was dark and decades old. We enhanced the views in and out of the lobby resulting in more transparent sightlines and general lightness.</p>
<p>It also became more functional with the latest door and window technology, an enlarged and optimized postal/package area, brighter lighting and signage, robust flooring and wallcoverings. A variety of seating allowed homeowners and guests to sit and enjoy the lobby as they hadn’t done before.</p>
<p>The final result is a highly refined main entry, while increasing each owner’s investment and quality of experience.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>EDG:</strong> We worked closely with our Sweeten contractor and solved a lot of unexpected issues during the renovation process. Our Sweeten contractor displayed a great amount of craftmanship, and took a lot of care to address all of the various conditions which came up along the way, making sure to adhere to the design intent and help realize the project vision.</p>
<p>Despite the typical adversity which comes with a construction project, the contractor’s disposition and their ability to communicate effectively and fairly made for a very good experience overall. We definitely recommend them, and would certainly work with Sweeten again in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do the new lobbies make the homeowners feel?</p>
<p><strong>Elsie:</strong> During the renovation, some of the old-timers didn’t understand why we were renovating a space that they felt was fine. Some felt their routine disrupted or questioned the cost. All valid feelings but the board’s job was to look at the bigger picture and what was best for the co-op overall.</p>
<p>Once the lobbies were finished the shareholders were very happy. There was a new fresh look with materials that were easier to keep clean. The mailbox area was also redesigned to handle increased internet shopping deliveries. The new automatic doors, use of key fobs, and a new digital intercom make the building more secure.</p>
<p>Even the naysayers have come around. Black-and-white photos pay homage to The Howard’s history and the seniors who have lived in the building since it opened.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> The Pilates Nook is a neighborhood Pilates studio that specializes in private sessions and semi-private group sessions. We teach mindful movement and bring an individualized approach to every client.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I’ve known Rowena for a few years now and it’s something she had always been dreaming about.</p>
<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> I’ve been teaching Pilates for quite some time and having a small place of my own was always the end goal for me. Once I saw this space, it was too perfect to not make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the space before the remodel?</p>
<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> It was cute with a lot of potential but felt much smaller than it does now. It had this amazing old tile, which sadly we couldn’t keep, a ton of natural light, amazing ceilings, and old brick walls.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">We were starting with a blank canvas, literally—no logo, no brand, just an idea.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> The turnaround for this project was quick (less than three months from inception to completion) and I owe a lot of that to Rowena and our Sweeten contractor. <span style="color: #333333;">We were starting with a blank canvas, literally—no logo, no brand, just an idea.</span></p>
<p>Rowena let me take creative control and come up with everything: a fresh color palette, logo ideas, custom millwork, and an interior layout. She would immediately let me know what she liked and didn’t like, which in my opinion, is what makes a dream client. With Sweeten, I was able to put the project up to bid and received quick and professional estimates within days.</p>
<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> It was a total whirlwind. Sarah and I sat down for coffee after seeing this space together, she gathered up some inspiration pictures, and I loved them! She was fast and efficient in pulling together plans with full renderings and logo designs and our Sweeten contractor quickly got the biggest jobs done first. The next thing I knew, we were getting equipment delivered in time to get clients in here.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> <span class="s1">A major part of the project was redoing the floors. There was a large section of the existing concrete floor that was almost two inches higher than the rest of the floor.  It was very important that the end result was level. I decided on day one of demolition that instead of chipping out the existing concrete block, we would pour the floors in sections in order to have the rest of the floor meet up and be level with that two-inch block. This required feathering out the surface at the door to meet with the existing saddle at the entrance door.  </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Once we had a level &#8220;base,&#8221; electrical heated floor mats were installed (so it&#8217;s warm when you take your shoes off) </span><span class="s1">and then add one more pour on top of that, followed by epoxy-based paint.</span></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new studio design represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> My studio is cozy, clean, and zen. It’s a space that allows the clients to walk in, get rid of their everyday stresses, be mindful of how their bodies feel, and move well. Sarah designed the space perfectly to allow just that.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> Our contractors executed the project perfectly off the plans given to them. They were on top of the scope of the work, they communicated their schedule effectively, and were responsive to the punch list.</p>
<p><span class="s1">With small spaces, it&#8217;s important to make sure everything has a home. I was able to accomplish that for many of Rowena&#8217;s Pilates tools by designing and having our Sweeten contractor build a custom window seat. On top is a sitting area for Rowena to do administrative work and for her dog, Walter, to sit and look out the window. Below are individual nooks for all her weights, cork blocks, and yoga mats. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had a few outlets installed and the lights put on a dimmer as well as electrical mats installed under the floors. The old flooring was pulled up as it wasn&#8217;t level and it is very important for Rowena&#8217;s practice that everything is aligned. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M46pF7SpsME&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40762 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/QA-HiringGC.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/QA-HiringGC.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/QA-HiringGC-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/QA-HiringGC-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rowena:</strong> They were clean and meticulous with their work. They made sure every detail was executed well and in a timely manner considering our turnaround time was so quick. And if they missed anything, they fixed it immediately.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of what makes this studio so special is all the little details. By painting the brick and concrete floors white, we were able to leave that East Village character but open up the space more and provide a canvas for the small decor to pop. </span></p>

They had the design in hand and needed to find a general contractor to execute their vision. They found a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching commercial space projects with vetted general contractors, and the result was a complete refresh with floor-to-ceiling stone slab tile, repainted original crown molding, and a new package room.

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you tell us about your building?</p>
<p><strong>Dan:</strong> The building is a co-op/condo 10-floor residential built in 1914.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the renovation of this new building lobby?</p>
<p><strong>Dan:</strong> The lobby was last renovated over 30 years ago. The wear-and-tear on the lobby was one of the main motivating factors. The other was the need to create a package room so that all the packages that arrived every day would not be left on the lobby floor.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What does the redesign achieve for the residents living there?</p>
<p><strong>Dan:</strong> It created a space that was a pleasure to walk into.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you work with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Dan:</strong> The design was already approved before Sweeten came into this project. Our contractor dealt with all the unexpected issues that arise in any renovation in a prompt and professional way.</p>
<p>The contractor would get back to me immediately with any matters or questions that I had. But more importantly, it was his professionalism and the detailed estimate he submitted that made the difference. He had the type of team that I wish I had during my five previous renovations.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> The lobby had two existing wall-mounted lights and we had to wire for two new ceiling-mounted fixtures. The problem was the existing electrical wiring, which we were going to use, would have cut into the beautiful crown molding that wraps around the ceiling. It was solved by running the electrical up the ceiling in a separate room and through the crawl space above the lobby ceiling. This avoided any damage to the original moldings.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">As one of a trio of on-site culinary options inside Chinatown’s Hotel 50 Bowery, Concept, the hotel’s boutique nightclub, was looking to redesign its space. The after-hours lounge would reflect the urban and culturally rich neighborhood it was located in. The owners tapped <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, to find a contractor to create their vision. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Flanked by a landmarked building on Bowery, the hotel&#8217;s history and bustle of Chinatown are reflected in a gritty yet glamorous underground club setting. Decorative chains hang overhead and ornate gold-framed mirrors cover the walls. Disco balls figure largely, reflecting light everywhere: on the main floor, atop mannequin’s heads, and fashioned as voluminous sculptures.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>A few steps up to the mezzanine behind the bar is an ode to some music greats, displayed through portraits and gold-colored discs resembling records. Life-sized mannequins decked out in gold glitter and mirrored heads add to the thrill&#8230;as if they’d come alive any second and join the party.</em> <em><span class="s1">Layering the space in moody materials, the brand uncovers an aura everyone can chill to. </span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Paul:</strong> Concept is an after-hours venue set up for a dynamic nightlife offering a thematic sequence of music programming designed to cater to downtown New York. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the remodeling of your space?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Paul:</strong> We had a change in brand direction for our basement lounge space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the theme that you were looking to create during the renovation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Paul:</strong> Our new theme is “beautiful fantasy.” We wanted to build a strong look concurrent to the “urban oasis” idea, found throughout the hotel, into the nightclub and adapted this into the world of nightlife, adding darker, more seductive elements, and motifs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_7271-e1500769492943.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28363 size-chrono" title="restaurant renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Chikarashi_Restaurant_4447.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-chikarashi-restaurant-nomad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chikarashi renovation</a> by Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Steven</a> and Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor Carl</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<p><em>With roots in upscale hospitality, such as Eleven Madison Park and The Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, Sandra Di Capua and Anthony Rudolf, along with Jennie Monness, saw a gap in the kind of playtime offerings they wanted for their own children. Their first space, Union Square Play, set out to be safe, clean, and visually appealing for babies and toddlers. They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> for a general contractor with the expertise and communication skills they were looking for. With the right lighting and a bright fresh remodel, the partners bring baby socializing to the next level.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Union Square Play?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Union Square Play is a place for local families. We both have kids and have been in New York for a long time. We wanted to have a space where families could come with their three-year-olds and under—a place to play, take classes, and get out of the weather.</p>

<p><strong>Sandra:</strong> When we opened the play space, it was a result of us having children of our own and living in a neighborhood to find that what was out there wasn&#8217;t perfect for us. So we really built it for ourselves. You could drop in for classes, engage with other parents and other children, and most importantly it’s a place where children could be in a space that was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong>  How did your Sweeten general contractor help you realize your vision?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> The ceilings aren&#8217;t super high but we knew that making it all white and beautiful would make it feel safe, home-y and just, useable. That was really the biggest thing for us. We worked with the bones of the space and didn&#8217;t do major architectural structural changes. Our contractor allowed us to brighten everything up and make it feel fresh. He came in on budget, which was hugely important.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you come to Sweeten? Did you work with Client Services?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was our first time using the Sweeten platform. I had a contractor I used exclusively on four or five spaces that I&#8217;ve built out in the past. He came a little over [budget] from what I was hoping to pay to build out [this play space]. So I said, “Okay, let&#8217;s give Sweeten a try and see if we can find a new contractor.” Early on, Client Services helped us with the process. We got five or six bids in, they helped us with the proper timing and decision process, and when to go back and bid for more. Once we selected our Sweeten contractor, it was smooth sailing from there.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten could help other entrepreneurs like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra: </strong>I think this process can be really intimidating. If you&#8217;ve never done a build out before, or even if you have, every project is different, and if you don&#8217;t have a super tight relationship with the contractor, or even if you do, you are always trying to figure out, “Am I getting charged properly?” “What&#8217;s the timeline supposed to be?” “What&#8217;s realistic or not?” With a platform like Sweeten, you get to compare different bids, get a feel for contractors&#8217; past work and budget, and what&#8217;s feeling out of my comfort zone or what’s feeling on point?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was also just getting to meet as many people as we got to meet through the platform; I think in one day we had eight people come through, which was just insane. The amount of effort it would take you to find, source, and schedule eight appointments is a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What was important for you to find in a general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Communication style and having good camaraderie. The relationship is critically important. I think that&#8217;s where our Sweeten contractor thrived. On the commercial side, there is typically capital investment that needs to get a return and every dollar counts. So we needed to get [to the end of the renovation] as fast as possible to start making money and start paying it back. We needed to do it as efficiently as possible. Not only was the contractor on site and knew the light fixtures and the nuts and bolts, but his partner was office-based and was our main point of contact where we were able to go back and forth. Things not only moved faster, but stayed on budget and we got the paperwork through very quickly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A renovation and decor overhaul were naturally in the plan when stylish design magazine Domino sought out a larger office in Midtown Manhattan for their 40-person team. They called on Sweeten for a general contractor who could carve out distinct and creative areas from a light-filled but blank open space, including a reception area, a photo studio, and a kitchen camera-ready for cooking demos. A complete build-out that was outfitted with pops of wallpaper, velvet seating, and decor galore, the result was a comfortable workspace for editors and guests alike.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT</strong>: <em><a href="https://www.domino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domino</a></em> moved to new offices to accommodate their growing company</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Midtown Manhattan</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you find Sweeten and what made you want to try the service?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Beth Brenner, <em>Domino</em>:</strong> A few colleagues were sitting around one afternoon contemplating partners for our new office reno. We were moving into an old sewing factory so we knew that we had walls to build. Our wish list also included a photo studio and studio kitchen where we could create food and entertaining content on an ongoing basis. But what we didn’t know was how to find a contractor to work with nor how to start the project! Our marketing manager asked if I had ever heard of Sweeten and proclaimed, “They are so on-brand for us.” Five minutes later, I sent a blind email to team@sweeten.com and, before the day’s end, Sweeten’s director of communications, Kerry O’Brien, responded. Seems the enthusiasm to work together was completely mutual!</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Why did Domino move offices?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We needed more space for our growing company—the best reason there is!</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new space reflect your brand?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> We set out to design a creative oasis that was full of light and energy—a chic space that felt at once casual and elevated, much like the <em>Domino</em> brand. While the furniture itself has a modern feel, the soft pink walls and mix of accessories and art really warm up the rooms. And, for an element of surprise and delight, we installed a Missoni-wallpapered “good vibes” phone room where team members can find a few minutes of peace.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30103 size-chrono" title="workspace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace02-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Office desk<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30148 mt-24 size-chrono" title="workspace with standing desk" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace10-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Office standing desk</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What are the favorite aspects of the new space?</p>
<p><em><strong>Domino</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Because there is only one conference room, it was important that the space be flexible and that distinct areas be carved out for smaller meetings, private phone calls, and visiting guests. Various “nooks” were created where people now gather, the most notable of which are the Anthropologie-infused reception area and, of course, our beautiful new kitchen, which was designed and built by our Sweeten contractor. As in every home, it’s the primary gathering spot!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30087 size-chrono" title="flexible workspace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace03-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Flexible workspace/reading area<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30093 mt-24 size-chrono" title="bar area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN-Domino-OfficeSpace01-723x1085.jpg" alt="office space design" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Acrylic consoles as bar area</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What kind of work desks does everyone have?</p>
<p><strong><em>Domino</em>:</strong> The desks themselves are all the same—modern white tables, mint green file cabinets, and cushion-y off-white chairs from our good friends at CB2—but it’s been fun to watch everyone on the team personalize their own space. There were also many requests for standing desks, so we added two adjustable desks from BDI and placed them in a central area so everyone could rotate through.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting a business is both daunting and exciting. It could mean that you will finally be your own boss, or have a chance to execute on an idea that has beckoned you for years. But that good idea and that excitement do not pay the bills. It will take some meticulous planning to get through a business renovation and end up with an enterprise that not only feeds your soul but pushes your business into the black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About 80 percent of small businesses fail in their first year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/small-business-central/2017/05/21/what-percentage-of-businesses-fail-in-their-first-year/101260716/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest reasons</a>? They get to the end of their budget by either not making a profit or underestimating the amount of time and capital they will need before crossing over into a profitable business. At <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, we want to see every business succeed. It’s one of the reasons why we offer a free service connecting business owners with fully vetted general contractors when it&#8217;s time to start or expand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few ways to make sure you don&#8217;t burn through your business&#8217;s renovation budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-40003 size-full aligncenter" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Minimize change orders with precise planning</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jimmy Haber knows a thing or two about successfully surviving a business renovation. His company, <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquared</a>, has a long list of successful restaurants, including the popular vegan dining chain <a href="https://eatbychloe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by CHLOE</a>. For Jimmy, the biggest disrupter to a budget is change orders. These can occur once the scope of work and budget are agreed upon by business owner and contractor, serving up an unexpected addition to the cost and complexity of a project. “A change order can happen for a thousand different reasons,” he said. “It could be as simple as ‘that outlet doesn’t belong there. It is better if it is here.’” Or more complicated such as needing to redo a design feature that doesn’t quite look right or drawing up a budget from a preliminary set of plans rather than a final set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You have to go through and meticulously plan everything out,” said Jimmy. Not only will the change order likely add to your budget, since you’re already in agreement with your contractor, it is more difficult to get a competitive price on that additional scope of work. “Because they already have the job, you no longer have any leverage, but they do,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency for staff costs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a delay in a construction project once new staff already has a start date will put any business owner in a dilemma. If you let those staff members go, then you&#8217;ll have to go through the time-consuming process of re-hiring replacements once you are ready to open. Or, if you want to secure the team you&#8217;ve hired, keeping them on the payroll might be the only way to stop them from going elsewhere. “This can be the most painful and difficult stage that can crush your budget,” said Jimmy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One solution is to be prepared with a contingency line item in the budget for staff costs in the case that construction is delayed and you’ve already hired your staff. Other times it might mean holding on to key staff, like executive chef for a restaurant or a general manager for a retail space, while letting go of those in high turnover positions such as servers.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a line of credit handy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like a lifebuoy in a pool area, a line of credit should be ready to go if your project needs additional cash to stay afloat, said Andrew Flamm. He is the director of the <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center,</a> which connects small business owners with funding as well as support and mentorship. A line of credit is different from a typical term loan. With a term loan, once you are approved you receive it in a lump sum and begin paying interest on it immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A line of credit requires approval; however, it remains in the lender&#8217;s possession. You only access it if and when you need to. You also only begin paying interest on the loan once you start using it and you don’t need to draw on the entire amount available to you. Only take what you need. “Then you are not scrambling to pay a bill or overextending on your credit card,” said Andrew. “That could have implications on your credit score and affect future funding down the road.” Lines of credit usually have a slightly higher interest rate than a term loan, but it could save your business and your personal credit score if you get into a bind.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare to pay operating costs early</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One area that trips up many new businesses is forgetting operating costs while a renovation is in progress, according to Alek Marfisi, a small business consultant with <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>. If you’re building out a space, you will still need to pay utility bills like gas and electricity, internet connection, business liability insurance, and property insurance. Having plenty of temporary working capital on hand is a must for these situations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Temporary working capital</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the contingency funds you need to have to pay for overruns in the cost of construction, you should have enough temporary working capital <span class="s1">to cover at least two months of operating expenses should the construction project take longer than planned. This is p</span></span>art of your entire budget for working capital, and is what helps you handle any unexpected costs compared to permanent working capital, which is what you typically need to run your business. “It will get you through the losses from starting or expanding your business and while you’re not making any money,” said Alek. Temporary working capital covers the construction period and the period of time <span class="s1">in which the business is losing money before it breaks even.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with so many other expenses, these operating costs will need to be paid regardless of whether your renovation project runs on schedule or gets delayed. That’s why these costs should also be factored into a contingency plan in case your opening date gets bumped back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managing a successful renovation in your business comes down to detailed planning. Plus, it’s never a bad thing to be overly generous with your contingency line item in your budget so you are ready if something goes wrong. And if it all goes to plan, then there&#8217;s more capital to invest back into your dream business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>From a traditional bank loan to equity crowdfunding, here are the options to fund your renovation</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7416-Ariel-e1507234831356.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27522 size-chrono" title="retail store renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7416-Ariel-723x482.jpg" alt="bank loan renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a>Retail shop, Spectre &amp; Co by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Joseph</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking to raise money to open a retail business or renovate an existing one, financing could come from many different directions. More than 50 percent of small businesses reported that they preferred borrowing from a bank, followed by using savings, and accessing a government-backed bank loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA), according to The Hartford&#8217;s latest report from 2015. There are also nontraditional forms of funding that are growing in popularity. Those opening restaurants, salons, or an office space will likely look into the same avenues for funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each type will have its pros and cons whether it&#8217;s a typical bank loan or a newer option like equity crowdfunding. Whichever way you choose, it is always best to do your research and make an extremely calculated decision so that borrowing capital can be a smooth stepping stone to a bigger, grander enterprise. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching commercial renovators with vetted general contractors, offers some avenues of financing to consider for your business renovation project.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Bank</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the obvious: a business loan from your local bank. The bar can be pretty high when it comes to getting your hands on this capital. Typically banks will require a high credit score as well as a good track record when it comes to running either your current business or previous businesses. “These are good for businesses that have been operating and have demonstrated they are profitable and in growth mode,” said Andrew Flamm from <a href="https://www.pacesbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pace University Small Business Development Center</a>, a nonprofit that advises small business owners and entrepreneurs. For successful retail businesses looking to expand to more locations or improve the existing space, a bank loan is a great option.</p>
<p><strong>Small Business Administration Loans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Small Business Administration loans are similar to bank loans. They come through a regular commercial bank but thanks to the federal government acting as a guarantor, they can be easier to get (note: easier does not mean easy). SBA loans suit those who might almost qualify for a common business loan. The government’s willingness to step in as guarantor helps push the bank over the lending line, said Flamm. One downside is there can be copious amounts of paperwork to fill out, according to Gary Levy, who works with restaurateurs through the firm <a href="https://www.cohnreznick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CohnReznick</a>. And even with the federal government backing the loan, the bank will still look into your credit history and business experience, but perhaps not to the same extent as a standard business loan, he said. The <a href="https://americassbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Business Development Centers</a> have offices throughout the U.S. and are funded mostly by the SBA. There are seven SBDC <a href="https://www.nyssbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locations</a> in New York City.</p>
<p><strong>Community Development Financial Institutions Fund</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CDFI is another government initiative with the goal of revitalizing communities with healthy small businesses. Funding sources come from federal dollars and some private sector capital. There are about 1,000 CDFI locations around the country and each can have a different mission, according to Amy Bunton from the <a href="https://www.pathwaywbc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathway Women’s Business Center</a>. The fund provides assistance to specific geographic areas and communities in need of revitalization. Some might provide assistance and lending to women, immigrants, and minorities. “CDFI’s are designed to help entrepreneurs take advantage of opportunities that traditional lenders can’t,” said Bunton. “They offer flexible terms and rates while also often providing educational services to their borrowers.” At Pathway Women’s Business Center, entrepreneurs can take courses and connect with a mentor along with finding financing.</p>
<p><strong>Friends and Family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asking for investments or a gift from friends and family is a common way to raise funds for a business. This is a good option if you’re a new entrepreneur and unlikely to get funding from a bank or with an SBA loan, according to Levy from CohnReznick. If it is an investment rather than a gift, how that investment will be paid out can go a myriad of ways. You will also have to decide if you take money from one investor or many. If it is one investor, then you will need to negotiate if that person gets any control in how you run your business. On the other hand, “if you have 20 different investors then that is a lot of people to manage,” Levy said.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo can be a gold mine for businesses wanting capital to start or expand. These sites allow you to pitch your idea on their website and people pledge money to your project often in exchange for a reward. Perhaps you are expanding your clothing store so you might give a limited edition t-shirt as a reward to those who pledge $100.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tens of thousands of dollars have been raised this way, even millions. It can act as a marketing campaign for your business, and generate press and social media buzz, said Flamm from Pace. “You have to outline who you are, what you are doing, and why people want to be a part of it,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the flipside, a crowdfunding campaign can be a lot of work. During the campaign—the average length is about 45 days—expect to be promoting it heavily and answering plenty of questions from potential pledgees. Crowdfunding platforms also take a small slice of what your campaign brings in, which is five percent at Kickstarter. And one last thing, on some platforms if you don’t make the goal you set for your campaign, you will not get any of the funds pledged. So, think strategically before launching a crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equity Crowdfunding</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In May 2016, Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups legislation went into effect allowing anyone to try their hand as a venture capitalist. Previously, US law prevented investors with a net worth below $1 million and who earn less than $200,000 from investing in private companies in exchange for equity, according to <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/05/16/title-iii-jobs-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>. That law change has paved the way for equity crowdfunding. Instead of businesses offering rewards for monetary gifts, like in regular crowdfunding, they can now offer equity and often in bite-sized pieces. For example, Republic Restoratives, a distillery in Washington D.C., raised $300,000 through 600 investors on Indiegogo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, businesses need to be prepared to put their financial information and the health of their business up on a website for the world to see. “If you’re an existing business and you’re not doing so well, you have to lay out all your financials,” said Alek Marfisi from <a href="https://upwindstrategies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwind Strategies</a>, a small business consulting firm. “Some businesses like to appear bigger than they actually are.” Since investments are often small, budding ventures, capitalists in equity crowdfunding are often attracted to “cool” projects, like a distillery, according to Marfisi. So, a business that is a solid investment but seems mundane might not attract the funding it should.</p>
<p>The myriad of financing options offers opportunities for start-ups to established companies. Do your research and you&#8217;ll be one step closer to getting your dream business to the next level.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What is Fool’s Gold Records and how did the brand begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ben Jacobs, Fool&#8217;s Gold Records:</strong> The company was founded by two DJs, A-trak and Nick Catchdubs, as a Brooklyn-based record label in 2007. We&#8217;ve morphed into a retail brand and a bit of a marketing agency, but first and foremost we&#8217;re a record label.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26311 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" />Original retail shop on Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What led to the opening of a brick-and-mortar store?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We felt it was important to have a retail presence as an extension of the brand and the art that we create. Our first retail store and offices were actually in the same space on Metropolitan in Brooklyn. We were making tee shirts and either selling them online or tossing them off stage at shows. We decided, “Let’s take advantage of this space and open it up to the public.” It was a success and just came to a point where we outgrew it and it was a little too small to do enough with it. I happened to walk by this building—147 Grand Street—and saw a big open space for rent. The wheels started turning and we decided to come up with a new space that was more functional for how the brand was evolving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How does your new retail space represent your brand? Why did you need to leave your former location? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> The old space was very narrow. Everything was fixed and there wasn’t much room to grow. The idea for the new space was not only to be bigger but a little bit more modular. For events, we have the flexibility to pull the podiums out or move the DJ booth over a bit. We’re doing art shows, workshops for kids, and DJ workshops—a range that ties into New York’s creative, arts and music community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How was your vision executed by working with Sweeten? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> I worked closely with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a> who did the work to make the space a reality. We had a pretty defined concept visually, but it was a bit up in the air in terms of how we were going to execute it. These enfilades that we’re sitting under, these three structures, were an experiment. We had to figure out how we were going to get the polycarbonate to stand and be sturdy and supported during events. Due to the nature of a lot of the materials we selected, there was a fair amount of trial and error and I appreciated the contractor&#8217;s willingness to experiment until we found the right methods and his patience throughout the process. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8220;The enfilades were a simple way to get a strong view right when you walk in. It also takes all the aspects of Fool&#8217;s Gold and puts them on display individually, sort of like laying out the ingredients for a recipe.&#8221; &#8211; Designer Dong-Ping Wong</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We found Sweeten through our designer, Family New York. I definitely noticed how quickly and efficiently we were able to get bids and that it wasn’t a disjointed process. From the receiving end, it was like, “Wow! We’ve got a lot of general contracting options here, and a lot of good people who are interested in this job. Great!” It simplified the process and gave us a very strict and transparent way of comparing our options and what’s out there. During the renovation, there was a lot of communication with our Sweeten contractor—emails, calls, weekly meetings. He was very involved in the process and genuinely concerned with making sure it turned out exactly as we were hoping.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help small business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> Sweeten helps business owners by simplifying and demystifying the process a bit. It’s pretty daunting if you’ve never been through the renovation process before. So you&#8217;ll have questions like, “Where do I start? What are the first steps? When do I know I’m done?” All these different questions you have going into it kind of blind. It definitely takes a bit of the edge off of figuring out what to do and if you’re feeling a little bit lost.</p>
