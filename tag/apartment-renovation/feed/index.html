<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32172 size-full" title="brick-wall-blue-white-couch" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg" alt="brick wall in living room with blue and white couches and a blue rug after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman13-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Should you renovate in stages or all at once?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve covered the expected timelines for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovations</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bath renovations</a>, but <strong>how long does an entire apartment renovation take?</strong> Since bathrooms and kitchens are usually the most time-intensive spaces to redo, the timeline for renovating a one-bedroom apartment is not much longer. Another bonus: the more spaces there are, the more opportunity there is to implement economies of scale and to multi-task! This approach allows you to save both time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re considering spacing out several projects (for budgetary reasons), you should consider doing them all at once. While it’s a larger sum upfront, it’ll likely be a better value for your money. For example, while you’re waiting for your cabinets to arrive, your contractor can paint the bedroom or install baseboards. Also, consider the cost– and time–effectiveness in using the permits and crew already scheduled for your project for a full scope rather than securing them multiple times.</p>
<h3>General timeframe for a one-bedroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, size and complexity determine how long an entire apartment renovation will take. If you aren&#8217;t moving walls or changing electrical or plumbing, your apartment renovation will be on the shorter side. <strong>On average, you should allocate about three to five months for on-site work in a top-to-bottom one-bedroom apartment renovation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline:</strong><strong> Pre-Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p>While the attention is usually on the most visible construction phase, there is a lot to be done before then. Here are the details on each box you&#8217;ll need to check before breaking ground on the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 1: Close on your property (1-3 months)</strong></h4>
<p>Many homeowners are in-contract or preparing to close on a property when they begin the process of planning a renovation. If this is you, don&#8217;t worry: there&#8217;s a way to get it all done. As one <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post explains, you should wait until you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/dos-donts-closing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed on the property</a>, with keys in hand, before doing anything. If you’re in a hurry—wait until you’ve at least signed the contract before beginning the design process.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 2: Post your renovation project on Sweeten (5 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;re in contract, or if you already own your apartment, you can post your project to Sweeten and <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin soliciting bids</a>. Add the details about the space you want to renovate, your inspiration photos (optional but useful for our matchmakers), and any other information that would help us find your perfect contractors. We&#8217;ll connect you with 3-5 of our trusted, vetted contractors who are a good fit for your project. </p>
<h4><strong>STEP 3: Schedule site visits and solicit bids (1-3 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve previewed the Sweeten contractors&#8217; profiles, and have decided you&#8217;d like to set up a meeting(s), our online scheduler will give you a two-week window to mark your available dates for a site visit. Both you and the contractor(s)  will receive an email confirming your available times, by which the contractor(s) will reach out to you to confirm a date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An on-site visit is the best way for a contractor to understand the scope of the project, the physical possibilities, and limitations of the space, and for the two of you to see if you hit it off! (This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/prep-bid-remodel-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> is a useful read for understanding the key info necessary to secure the most accurate bid.) After you schedule your on-site visit, check out our blog post about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to prepare</a> for the meeting. You should expect a written bid within 5-10 business days after your visit.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 4: Level bids and choose a contractor (1-2 weeks)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the written bids have come in, it’s time to compare and contrast! This <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primer</a> on leveling bids might come in handy. If you have follow-up questions, now is the time to ask. You can also schedule time with a Sweeten project advisor to walk you through the various bids and weigh in on the selection.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 5: Sign the contract and finalize construction schedule (1 week)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve decided on a contractor, he or she will put together a contract for you to review. This will typically include a description of the work to be done, an estimated timeline for completion, as well as the timing of payments throughout the project.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 6: Obtain permits and approvals (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the steps where hiccups or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delays might occur</a>, this is it. Obtaining the correct permits and board approvals have held up many a renovation, but don’t be daunted: our experts are well-versed in navigating these processes and can advise you on how best to achieve your renovation goals with the least amount of hassle. If you’re moving plumbing or gas lines, you’ll need an architect and additional DOB permits. Sweeten homeowners have reported obtaining approvals in as little as two weeks—but it’s more common for it to take a couple months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in a stand-alone house, you won’t need to worry about building board approvals, but you’ll still need the requisite city permits for any electrical or plumbing work to make sure that everything is up to code.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 7: Source materials (ranges widely)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are responsible for sourcing all or some of the materials in your renovation, be sure to place the orders as soon as the design plan is finished. Certain items have long lead times, and you don’t want that one faucet to hold up the entire renovation. If time is a concern, look at what’s currently in stock and ready to ship. Speak with your contractor about timing the product delivery to coincide with time of installation.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 8: Tell your neighbors you&#8217;re renovating (15 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be a good neighbor and warn yours that a renovation is beginning imminently. Tell them what to expect and how long the project is slated to last. It’s always easier to stomach the disruption when you know there’s an end in sight! It doesn’t hurt to bring some sweets, a bottle of wine, or a gift card for a local coffee shop. When the reno is over, invite them over!</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline</strong><strong>: Construction Phase</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most of the steps under “Construction” are your contractor’s responsibility, it’s important to understand what should be happening when. The most important steps you’ll be in charge of here are making scheduled payments to your contractor (as outlined in your contract), and keeping your schedule open for several hours a week to answer questions about details or changes that come up over the course of construction.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 9: Time for demolition (2-5 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out with the old! Now that you’re done with the paperwork, it’s time for your contractor to pick up that sledgehammer. Be sure to protect the items that are staying with tarp or plastic, and get to work tearing out everything else. Depending on how large your apartment is, and how extensive the renovation, this shouldn’t take more than two to five days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 10: Reroute plumbing and electrical (2-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our national survey, 62% of respondents named finding hidden problems in their home as a top renovation fear. Now that you’ve stripped the space down to the studs, it’ll be easy to get new plumbing or electrical where it needs to go. Consider whether any plans should be altered now, since you&#8217;re able to see what’s behind the walls.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 11: City inspections and sign-offs (1-4 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you needed city permits for electrical and/or plumbing work, you&#8217;ll need inspections and a sign-off before closing the walls. While a master plumber can typically sign off on pipework for water lines in the case of a no-show by the city inspector, an inspector must examine and approve any work on gas lines. You are not allowed to close up the walls and move onto the next phase of the project until this inspection happens. With electrical work, inspectors generally are scheduled for visits once the project is 100 percent complete, and they will check the electrical panel, junction boxes, and outlets. (Note that sometimes, because of city bureaucracy and delays, your electrical inspection may be rescheduled two or three times.) Check with your contractor or architect about what your project requires.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 12: Floor installation (5-12 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent having to redo the floors if you decide to reconfigure your space in the future, make sure that the flooring is consistent throughout, even if some of it will be hidden. After the floors are in, you’ll add new baseboards.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 13: Installation completion (5-20 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the kitchen, usually in this order: cabinets, appliances, fixtures and lighting, counters, backsplash, and cabinet hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install the bathroom, including the tub, vanity and sink, toilet, and any built-in shelving. Tiling, lighting, and hardware usually come last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the hallways and bedroom, if you are doing basic painting and touch-ups, the work will be fairly minimal compared to the kitchen and bath. If you are adding custom, built-in shelving or paneling, plan to add a few extra days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Possible delays: aspects of this may vary, depending on site conditions and the arrival time of the materials.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 14: Clean-up (1 day)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, contracts allow that spaces should be left in “broom-swept” condition. However, you may want to hire post-construction cleaning specialists to make sure that your new floor is clean enough to eat off. For a full apartment, plan on requesting at least two cleaners to work at the same time so that it can be finished in one working day.</p>
<h3><strong>Apartment Renovation Timeline: Post-Construction Phase </strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">The finish line is in sight! But don’t forget these last—but important—steps. </span></p>
<h4><strong>STEP 15: Final walk-through with the contractor (1-2 hours)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Review the work with your contractor: try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should. If there are any problems, point it out and add them to the punch list. The contractor will either fix it on the spot (if it’s minor) or set up another time to return. Sweeten&#8217;s founder + CEO, Jean Brownhill, recommends keeping notepads in each space, and not speaking to your contractor for two weeks during this time. Instead, take notes of what needs fixing as you live in your new home.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 16: Punch list items (1-10 days)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on what the items are, this step could take anywhere from a day to several weeks. It depends on the items left: are you straightening a cabinet door, or waiting on installing an out-of-stock item? When it’s on the long side, though, it&#8217;s usually due to back-ordered items. Otherwise, your contractor should be able to return and fix everything in a few days.</p>
<h4><strong>STEP 17: The final payment (10 minutes)</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You’ve (hopefully)! made installments throughout the renovation. When the last item on your punch list is complete, it’s time to pay the remaining percentage to your contractor!</p>
<h3>Ready to renovate your apartment?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This timeline provides a detailed look at the various aspects of renovating and a range of how long each step should take. While some factors may be outside of both your and the contractor’s control, the key is isolating the steps that you think might be obstacles in advance, and allotting more time to get them done.</p>

<h3>Popular Questions Asked</h3>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639487570544"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How long does it take to renovate an apartment?</strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Apartment renovation timelines are highly variable. On the short end, an apartment renovation from beginning to end could take 4 months; on the long end, it could take over a year. Obtaining permits from local municipalities, sourcing materials, and construction can add significant time to the renovation schedule. For example, some municipalities have very strict permitting processes or may require specific plans to be submitted by an architect before permits are issued. If you’re sourcing luxury materials from sources abroad, shipping and importing the products can be lengthy. Also, discovering hidden surprises during demolition (think: water damage, or wiring issues) may require a contracting team to problem-solve before proceeding with construction as planned. </p>

<h3>Remodeling for a new life chapter</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Manhattan couple bought their three-bedroom apartment in Kips Bay Towers, designed by renowned architects I.M. Pei and S.J. Kessler, more than 30 years ago, they renovated. Fast forward three decades, which included the whirlwind of raising kids, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/renovations-dream-homes-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it was time for a redo</a>. What had looked good then, now looked tired and outdated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had already been renovated a second time and the avid entertainers, who host plenty of dinner parties, made the living and dining rooms next on the renovation list. Their interior designer, <a href="https://tarabenet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Benet</a>, turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this Sweeten contractor</a> to bring the vision to life.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>Enhancing natural light in the home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen curtains were drab and did not gracefully frame the exceptional floor-to-ceiling views from the glass-front apartment complex. The cream and beige tones also did little to complement the New York City backdrop. Comfy couches and cluttered decor lacked the glamorous, crisp, and adventurous style reflecting the couple&#8217;s modern-day taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wood flooring also became an issue. The original rug had been in the same spot for 30 years. The intense natural light left a darker footprint where the UV rays had not faded the varnish. The couple went with a lighter floor color to match the overall brighter look, adding a fresh touch to the whole renovation. Previously, the homeowners had used old-fashioned track lighting because the concrete ceiling couldn’t take any sunken lights. Their modern solution? Using two chandeliers to light the room. As a bonus, their unique design also made them a focal point in the living area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A white-painted background became a canvas for the other elements in the room to stand out. However, the couple came to learn that white is never just white. &#8220;There was a lot of debate over the white which needed to be a little bit warmer than it was before. We ended up with a shade that has a tiny bit of orange. It has a glow to it,&#8221; Tara said. And to offset the white, a muted royal blue acts as a deep color accent and can be seen running through the custom-made rug, a throw rug, and the living room chairs. (Blue is also a contrasting color to the orange hue added to the white paint.)</p>
<h3>Picking the materials and color palette</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A secondary color palette—the metallics of brass, bronze, and gold—further balance the blue accent. This is seen in the vases on the dining room table, in the construction of the coffee table, woven into the pillows, and throughout the lamps and light fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, couch, rug" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35655" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-02-1-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the strength of the view through the windows, Tara helped her clients achieve an uncluttered look and did not use much wall art. To inject some creativity, they picked out well-designed furniture that could almost double as art pieces. The blue chairs from designer Walter Knoll function like little works of art that you can sit in, as do the Roche Bobois sofas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg" alt="Manhattan renovation, Murray Hill, home, design, living room, open floor plan, dining room" width="1000" height="1400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-600x840.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-723x1012.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-04-1-585x819.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heavy linen drapes were replaced with near-translucent fabric, letting in more light and giving a gossamery feel. And the view will never be obscured. The curtains are purely for appearances; they are locked into the ceiling and floor and cannot be moved, ensuring the &#8220;wow&#8221; moment when guests get a first glimpse of the cityscape. &#8220;They literally never want to close the windows,&#8221; Tara said.</p>
<h3>The key to remodeling success? Team communication.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Tara, their Sweeten contractor was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great communicator and in constant communication</a> with her and the clients. He was even willing to meet with the client on weekends to keep the project on schedule. With a touch up for the millwork, a fresh coat of paint, and refinishing the floor varnish, it’s a reminder that less often equals more when luxe furniture and lighting make up a dream space.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Update a kitchen with low-grade materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jen rented in neighborhoods across Brooklyn for 10 years before she bought her first apartment in a 1937 Crown Heights co-op building. She fell in love with how open the space was—with the exception of the tight, closed-in kitchen. The kitchen was recently renovated, but with cheaper, run-of-the-mill materials that didn’t quite match Jen’s style.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-15-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a huge fan of the simple, Scandinavian vibe,&#8221; she said. (Think: neutral calming colors, simple design, and warm touches for that <a href="https://www.hyggelife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hygge life</a>). Jen purchased the 950-square-foot apartment with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intention to renovate</a> but decided to wait to get a better sense of how’d she use it.</p>

<h3>Opening up the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I had a pretty clear vision of the aesthetics and giving myself that extra year solidified those design decisions. My sofa faces the kitchen, so I&#8217;d spend more hours than I&#8217;d like to admit looking at it and imagining what I&#8217;d do,” Jen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35187" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-09-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the kitchen had an opening to the living room, it still felt closed off to the rest of the apartment because its working surfaces were behind a wall. &#8220;A weird empty space in the left part of the kitchen was supposed to be an eat-in area, but I was never going to use it for that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35184" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3>Adding a peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors removed a wall came down and replaced it with a peninsula to connect the kitchen and living room. Instead of building out full upper cabinets, Jen opted for open shelving for an airy feel. She also took advantage of the extra space on the left side of the kitchen to add more base cabinetry. “Though I heard my share of conflicting opinions about open shelving, I’m so glad I stuck to my guns,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old flooring was replaced with wood</a> to match the living area. An integrated dishwasher and counter-depth fridge were installed for that European vibe. Jen did wind up compromising on a built-in gas cooktop and wall oven due to electrical restrictions. However, she ultimately attained the Scandinavian-minimal look she was aiming for.</p>

<h3>Finding tips and tricks for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With her Crown Heights kitchen renovation behind her, Jen offers a few words of wisdom. For one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start putting together a materials list</a> before you even hire a contractor. Jen assembled a spreadsheet with everything from appliances to light fixtures to track items she loved, and see if they went on sale. (Tip: Jen browsed Sweeten reno posts and their detailed source lists to find items!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-10-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35340" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-13-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She loved the transformation so much, choosing a favorite element was nearly impossible. “Is it cheating if I say the entire kitchen [is my favorite?] I’m still stunned by how transformed the space is with the wall gone.” She added, &#8220;Frankly, I never want to leave my apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, neutral kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jen recommends adding drawers to base cabinets for easier access to dishes. “I&#8217;m a shorty, so having all my dishes in drawers, instead of having to reach for them on my tippy toes, has been awesome,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h3>A new art deco apartment home<span>—in need of work</span></h3>
<p>Lindsay, Nicholas, and their cat, Sibyl, returned to New York City after two years in Baltimore and landed on a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in upper Manhattan. “Nicholas fell in love with the [art deco] lobby, and we both loved that it was right across the street from Inwood Hill Park and has a killer view of the Cloisters,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p>The apartment itself was so-so. It had some classic art deco features, like a sunken living room with herringbone wood floors, which Lindsay and Nicholas wanted to mix with their mid-century tastes. A bland kitchen and bathroom needed some help. The molding, doors, and paint were also due for a refresh. And then there were those two things many New Yorkers consider an ultimate luxury<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/9735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their art deco apartment remodel</a> and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a> to execute the construction and the design. Lindsay and Nicholas were given a six- to eight-week timeline from start to finish and camped out in a sublet during the renovation. A few hiccups along the way stretched that timeline (more on that later).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42173" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan.jpg" alt="Brooklyn floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was to gut renovate the bathroom and make minor changes in the kitchen while doing mostly cosmetic updates to the rest of the apartment. A standout feature in the living area is the sliver of wallpaper that peaks out from the small hallway off of the living room. “Since it’s such a small space, we figured we could go a little crazy,” said Lindsay. That “little crazy” translated to an art deco-style wallpaper with teal, purple, and gold accents. “Even our friends who hate patterns and bright colors love it,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p>Salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42174 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Kitchen renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42167" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Cabinet refinish" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the current layout had a nook where the previous owners had placed a small breakfast table. Lindsay saw this as an ideal way to add more counter space. There was a miniature dishwasher “which made no sense since there was plenty of room for a full one,” said Lindsay. Rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut renovate</a> the kitchen (a decision the couple later regretted), they refinished the existing “country-style” cabinets in a gray modern tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark grout in the backsplash tiles upped the modern feel. The only appliance they replaced was that tiny dishwasher. “We are happy with how it came out,” said Lindsay, “but salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the only original feature that remains is the cast-iron tub with its detailed edges. Lindsay and Nicholas had it re-enameled so it matched the new bathroom. A new washer/dryer would replace an existing shower area and a shower would be added to the bathtub. For maximal storage, shelving lined the laundry wall in hard-to-reach places and double doors were installed to hide the clutter.</p>
<p>When the decision came to choose either a console sink or a vanity, they decided on a console. (The under-the-sink space became the new location for Sibyl&#8217;s litter box.) For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>, a large medicine cabinet, and niche shelves along the bathroom and shower walls did the trick. A matte black hexagonal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> became the new backdrop in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp" alt="black and white bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57241 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature the couple recommends to other renovators is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>. To remedy some oddly-placed shelves and a rod, their Sweeten contractor ripped everything out of the bedroom closet and installed a new system that can easily be changed later on as storage needs shift. “Custom designing the closets made a huge difference in how useful the spaces were,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-04.gif" alt="Washer dryer renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project hit a major snag when it came to the electrical work which pushed the end date back. Wiring dedicated to powering the washer/dryer had to be installed and ripped out twice from the ceiling. Despite this, it still shorted out the power after only a few uses. In the end, it was discovered there was a faulty part in the basement and the situation was fixed. Throughout the issue, Sweeten&#8217;s customer service, which checks in on renovations until projects are completed, stayed in communication until it was resolved and helped coordinate a new realistic timeline agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After their experience, Lindsay and Nicholas came out with a home they loved, but also some things they would do differently next time. “Always gut renovate,” said Lindsay. “We were trying to be thrifty by keeping the kitchen cabinets.” The other tip: plan for the renovation to take twice as long. But ultimately, the Sweeten contractor did a fantastic job,” said Lindsay<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and enhanced the features of the apartment to turn it into a unique home for their family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A self-proclaimed millennial&#8217;s first renovation in Midtown East</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sherry, a recent college graduate, was excited to make her family’s rental property in Manhattan into her first home. Once she got a job offer in New York, she knew it was time to remodel the outdated space. The renovation process started with a lot of compromise between Sherry and her then-boyfriend, but over time, evolved into a project all her own. After posting her project to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, she chose the one she felt would bring her ideas for each room to life. Here, the journey to the final design of her first major renovation.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My family purchased an apartment in Midtown East during the height of the 2008 financial crisis and immediately turned it into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovate-your-rental-property-wisely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rental property</a>. While in Connecticut for college, I dreamt of moving to New York and making that apartment my first home. The property hadn’t been renovated since being built in the ‘80s and felt outdated. And there were practical issues to consider, including extensive water damage on the hardwood floors from a tenant who had left the living room windows open for weeks. When I started a job in New York last year, it was time to make my dream into a reality and take the plunge on renovating the space.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35602 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, I was planning on moving into the apartment with my now ex-boyfriend and we each had a lot of ideas for what needed to be addressed in the remodel. While I was mostly focused on making aesthetic and design improvements, he thought we needed to change the entire floor plan by moving walls and doorways around. As we were trying to find a compromise, we heard about Sweeten and decided some expertise and personal attention would be helpful in guiding us through the home renovation process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with several potential general contractors who could make the changes we wanted within budget. We met with one who spent hours discussing all of our renovation ideas and possibilities in detail. We liked his vision and readiness to tackle the challenges of our space and knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the right contractor</a> for us.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35605 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, living room, kitchen, dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-19-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we honed in on the details of the remodel, my boyfriend and I spent countless hours debating choices about tile, paint colors, and finishes. I realized the project wasn’t going how I had envisioned and about three months into the process, we broke up. I went back to the contractor and we agreed to scrap the original plan and completely redesigned everything in 48 hours. By the end of those two very stressful (but liberating!) days, we were ready to move forward.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35601 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, open living, kitchen, counter, sink, refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my first priorities was to update the<span style="color: #000000;"> <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a> throughout the apartment.</span> I knew I needed to address the water damage in the living room and also wasn’t in love with the original floorboards, which were narrow and felt outdated. I wanted to update the space in a more modern and millennial style, which meant making design choices that had a sense of utility while also being simple, sleek, and refined. We installed beautiful, wide, oak floorboards that anchored the space in an elegant way and became the foundation for the rest of my design choices. There&#8217;s a sense of an overall artistic feel leaning toward urban chic (simple, cool tones).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed to find ways to enlarge the<span style="color: #000000;"> living room and kitchen </span>as much as possible. We decided to remove a closet near the front door to add space to the living area while slimming the walls around the kitchen to keep it as open as possible. The decor was kept simple with lots of neutral grays and blues, which helped create the illusion of more space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom and bedroom</span>, however, would have strong design statements. In the bathroom, there were two: a beautiful, circular mirror with a beveled, asymmetrical frame that I fell in love with instantly, and the chevron shower tile (that I was inspired to use after looking through past <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten projects</a>!) I couldn’t resist adding two gorgeous sconces next to the mirror and lots of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in storage</a>. My Sweeten contractor helped bring these ideas to life within my budget; I made my choices for the lighting, the mirror, and tiles within the contractor’s app and signed off on each decision.</p>

I chose to build the design around a Nepalese rug I owned, which had earthy tones and hints of red. The contractors customized my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closet</a> for me and painted one of the walls a soothing gray to complement the deep hue of my red velvet headboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, my experience with Sweeten and my contractors could not have been more positive! Everyone involved was great about communicating challenges while still striving to make my dream a reality. Now that my cat, Zelda, and I have moved in, it’s such a pleasure to get ready every day in front of my beautiful bathroom vanity and walk on my smooth, new, hardwood floors knowing that I hand-picked every element. Designing your space from top to bottom is something I would recommend to everyone—the sense of satisfaction and pride in your space is well worth all the work involved!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple&#8217;s optimism yields a washer-and-dryer—and more—in Brooklyn</h2>
<p><em>Who wants to schlep laundry up and down five flights of stairs? That’s what motivated Lynn, Craig, and their pooch Pistol to renovate their first home, a 1,200-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op. But not so fast. First, they couldn’t find a contractor willing to take on the job of remodeling two tiny bathrooms. Then they couldn’t get one on board for a washer-and-dryer install. They eventually turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, where they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and were matched with a vetted general contractor not only </em>willing,<em> but excited, to take on the job. All this while the clock was ticking on their move-in date.</em></p>

<p>After living in rentals forever—from 300-square-foot studios to windowless apartments— we were ready to buy something of our own. When Lynn co-founded her business—Dome, a multidisciplinary design studio—in 2014, we casually began to look for a place where she could work from home.</p>
<p>For two years, we visited open houses to learn about the Brooklyn housing market. Many of the homes felt oddly chopped up, hastily constructed, overpriced, or were projects too intimidating for us to tackle for our first home purchase. We wanted a space that felt open and bright, where we wouldn’t hit the walls within a year, and that was in a welcoming neighborhood.</p>

<p>When we found this two-bedroom, 1.5 bath co-op in a circa 1930s Prospect Heights building close to express subways, our friends, Prospect Park’s off-leash area, and saw it had lots of space and light, we immediately put in a bid. We thought we had a chance, given it was a steep fifth-floor walk-up—a deterrent for many buyers in a competitive market. We ended up losing the bid, only to have the owner come back to us weeks later offering us the home after the first deal fell through. Our move-in date was two months later, in mid-September.</p>
<p>We started out just wanting a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry hook-up</a> in the half-bath. We’d spent years hauling bags to coin laundromats and felt a washer-and-dryer were non-negotiable. But once we started thinking things through, our small project ballooned. We soon realized that both bathrooms needed to be gutted. The full bath had no storage and was on a 10-inch platform to accommodate mid-century plumbing. The half-bath was previously used as a cat’s bathroom, accompanied by a pet door—and a significant odor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34613 mb-0 size-full" title="gray-living-room-rug-under-chairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg" alt="gray living room with rug under chairs and gray couch and long double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-13-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Sweeten project post</a>, titled “Make These Bathrooms My Favorite Rooms” captured our optimism to transform these small, dismal rooms into a smarter space for our lifestyle and aesthetic taste. So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose our Sweeten contractor</a>. We didn’t expand either footprint, but were strategic about how each element would really be used, cleaned, and look next to each other.</p>
<p>Overall, we replaced four bathroom and closet doors made of tired, hollow-core faux wood with solid-slab, single-panel Shaker doors. The dark wood floors in the rest of the apartment ground the space and the white walls reflect light. The high-contrast gave us a great foundation for our furniture, textiles, and plants.</p>

<p>We also saw a great opportunity to demo the dining room and envisioned a “great room” with flow between the kitchen, dining, and living rooms where we could host gatherings. After living in claustrophobic rentals, we wanted the first impression to be of openness and light.</p>
<p>Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed us to renovate without an architect. We measured each wall’s dimension and built a model of the home in <a href="https://www.sketchup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SketchUp</a>. We could quickly see how to scale any fixtures or make changes. And, the model helped us discuss in more detail with contractors, such as rear-outlet toilets, fixture finishes, grout types, and bath fan sone ratings (for loudness).</p>

<p>The dining room walls were not load-bearing, and there are always surprises when you start opening up floors and walls. When our Sweeten contractor demo’d the dining room walls, he found charred beams in the ceiling from a long-ago fire. We had no idea there had been damage. He reinforced the ceiling with new wood to ensure structural stability.</p>

<p>In the full bathroom, which is 35 square feet, we weren’t sure if we’d be able to drop it down 10 inches. Before we had even hired our contractor, he took out his chisel and broke a peephole into the floor to see what was possible. He gave us confidence that we could make it work, ultimately dropping the entire bathroom, keeping the bathtub at the elevated height, and building out a wall for our new sink and cabinet fixtures.</p>

<p>We included so many details in this bathroom that make all the difference on a day-to-day basis, including a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighted</a> medicine cabinet with outlets inside to allow us to charge our toothbrushes out-of-sight, thereby removing clutter; the near-silent bathroom fan serves as the main light and is hidden without a vent cover; and a wall-hung sink and cabinet allows for more storage and easier cleaning underneath.</p>

<p>As for the half-bath—only 24 square feet—several contractors, who initially inspected the job advised us to forego the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-and-dryer</a> altogether, saying it was impossible, or that we had to tap into our toilet line and disrupt the apartment below. Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plumbing team found a simpler solution by tapping into the small sink&#8217;s line. We got a compact, ventless Bosch washer-and-dryer to accommodate the water line, electrical load, and tight space in the bath. Remodeling this room has been a life-changer.</p>
<p>The other issue in this space was the overwhelming odor of cat urine. We tried every odor-reducing spray and paint on the market, and used black lights to expose urination spots, but in the end, we had our contractor gut the walls and floor down to the slab to remove the contaminated wood. Every visit during the renovation had our contractor sniffing in corners, trying to find new origins of contamination. Thankfully, it does not smell like cat pee anymore. We also replaced the dated fixtures in that bath with the smallest toilet and sink we could find.</p>

<p>Overall, everything went pretty smoothly. Our biggest challenge, really, had been finding a contractor. But Sweeten gave us three leads, and our contractor came to the first meeting as if he already had the job, giving realistic explanations for what it would take to accomplish the work. During the renovation, he rarely said no or told us a change wasn&#8217;t possible. As we added to our original scope, he was incredibly flexible and adjusted his timeline and the work to hit our mid-September move-in date. He gave us recommendations when we didn’t know what to buy, explained to us what was needed, and helped us quickly to complete the work.</p>

<p>Sweeten helped us, too, by getting us to clarify our scope and put a realistic budget into our initial post. We learned that even though our timeline was compressed, renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice is if you can do a major renovation before moving in, bite the bullet and get it done. Don’t put off with cleaning the dust later on. We plan to continue renovating in phases, but wanted to get the most disruptive work completed before moving in.</p>
<p>Having gone through four rentals in six years, we always struggled to feel at home. Our new space is beautiful and feels like something we can make our own. We enjoy inviting others into it as often as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked in Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was the view from their apartment at the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroom place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattan—the island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadn’t been updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist for their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use it—and to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment at various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>, who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didn’t need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created a custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and Jim had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to create a guest sleeping area that feels like a “studio within the apartment,” explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-length <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter space leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33877 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, subway tile, stainless steel appliances, sliding door, spot lighting" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33878 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-blue-kitchen-cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-14.gif" alt="gray blue kitchen cabinet with oven and a white door after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, they chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale find—the black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They paired those tiles with an unusual bronze <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant. A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped to finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractor—one with whom you can have a good “communication cadence,” said Margery. “We would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.” They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Vitoria, an art historian, and Jonathan, a location scout, purchased their 650-square-foot co-op in a century-old building in South Williamsburg, they began discussing renovations right away. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22955#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> to create a new home for the couple, daughter Asa, and Ramona, the family dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33753 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33563 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was in &#8220;okay&#8221; shape, but it had little storage and the materials used were poor quality—laminate flooring and old Ikea cabinets. It would need a lot of updates along with better quality materials, such as kitchen countertops and new hardwood floors, but they were limited on budget and time. Some of their efforts went into looking ahead toward selling in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vitoria, who is inspired by the simplicity of Japanese design, envisioned uncluttered white space with lots of natural wood color. “Since we are growing a family in a small space, a place that looks tidy and serene was a priority. For us ‘negative space’ is actually positive,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p>We replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood [so] the unevenness is barely noticeable.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Once the demo began, they were faced with a few surprises including rotten pipes in the kitchen sink and toilet and uneven floors. </span>Changing the floor was imperative. Vitoria said she had some “crazy ideas” to put in cork floors or use raw plywood cabinets in the kitchen, but then realized those materials would not increase the resale value and were too specific to her own personal taste. They opted instead for a pre-finished <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oak hardwood</a> which their contractor suggested. She admitted she was scared at first since the color of the boards varied quite a lot, but she soon fell in love. “The wood floor has so much personality!” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While redoing the subfloor in the bathroom, they decided not to renovate all the subflooring throughout the rest of the apartment to save time and money, &#8220;Since we replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood,&#8221; Vitoria said. &#8220;the unevenness is barely noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor helped with the layout of the kitchen, fitting in more storage with cabinets that were taller and deeper. They kept the stove and washer-and-dryer in the kitchen and purchased a new refrigerator. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow cabinet for their spices</a> flanks the hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33568 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33569 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few &#8220;must-haves&#8221; on the couple&#8217;s list; in fact, Vitoria chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quartz countertop</a> before she even chose a contractor. “Quartz is a great material, especially for clumsy cooks like me,” she said. She also insisted on a Toto toilet and a slim Blomberg refrigerator. “These were non-negotiable. I had to have them!” Since the remodel, Vitoria said, “I actually have more space in the cabinets than I have things to put in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also loved the idea of untreated pine for the open shelves above the sink to store what she called their “showpieces.&#8221; While visitors may think it’s yet to be painted, she is happy with the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33571 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33572 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, hexagon floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had a good working relationship with their contractor, who not only had a great personality but sourced materials that fit their taste and worked for resale while being adept at managing their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their contractor took up the bathroom floor, he discovered the original 100-year-old tiles, which were cracked and loose. He had to remove two layers of tile and redo the subfloor, which delayed the project by a couple of days. &#8220;Throughout the whole process, he was very aware that we had no wiggle room in the budget and was super cost-conscious. We are extremely grateful for that,&#8221; said Vitoria.</p>
<p>During the chaotic periods, they were glad to have Sweeten in their corner. Vitoria liked that Sweeten contacted her often during the renovation, commenting that it made her feel well taken care of and gave her peace of mind.</p>
<p>Post-renovation, Vitoria knows that there will always be unexpected issues no matter how good your contractor is or how fat your budget. “But having a home that you love makes it worth every penny spent,” she said. “Although my home is small, it feels spacious. I confess I only leave if I have to.”</p>

<li><span class="s2"><strong>Homeowners:</strong><span> </span>Lee, an entrepreneur and startup founder, wanted an updated bathroom and white IKEA kitchen. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his renovation</a> on Sweeten</span></li>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: This feature, originally published in the summer of 2015, is one of Sweeten&#8217;s favorite dramatic makeovers. An overpowering closet flanking the existing galley kitchen seemed to squeeze the entry even tighter. The changes, though, were striking: the walls came down, and newly-placed high gloss cabinets took the spotlight, amplified in natural light. The affordability of this <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full IKEA kitchen</a> renovation is an extra bonus. The takeaway: a bit of shiny goes a long way.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee Hoffman bought a 1+ bedroom, 1 bathroom co-op in Midtown East. The original kitchen and bathroom were beyond forlorn; the kitchen was hidden behind a walled entryway and was more of a hallway than a room. This might have been initially helpful during its heyday in 1978, but not ideal in an apartment that depended on the kitchen window for extra light in the living room. Lee did months and months of research on ways to update the space. He came to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor who could change up a cramped kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update a plain bathroom</a>.</p>

<p>After reviewing a selection of Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Manhattan</a>, he chose one to re-envision the space with some nice cabinets and tile. However, the renovation turned into much more than that.</p>
<h3>Tackling a cramped kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee found himself up against one major, invisible force when he <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started the kitchen project</a>: the co-op&#8217;s previous tenant had been a smoker and the original stock finishes were covered in smoky residue. The layout for the already-small kitchen didn&#8217;t work well. The space was virtually sealed off from the living room, and its big window was partially blocked by cabinetry and a fridge that had been wedged into the galley. Lee knew he could swap in new cabinets and appliances. However, when <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing options with his contractor</a>, he learned that the dividing wall was non-load-bearing. Removing the wall would let light into the living room from two directions. He put together a lengthy list of &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves&#8221; (from wall demolition all the way down to soft-close cabinets). The same approach was used to bring light and modern appeal to the crumbling bathroom.</p>

<h3>An IKEA kitchen fit the budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee took on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut remodel of the kitchen</a> with the determination of a tech entrepreneur. He spent a month talking to every cabinet maker in NYC before accepting that even the lowest price for a high-end, custom-built set was way <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond his budget</a>. Even the next tier down felt costly, and the slightly more budget-friendly options at big-box retailers didn&#8217;t seem like an obvious slam dunk. After reading positive reviews about IKEA cabinets, and realizing that a whole new IKEA line was about to hit the market, he found himself psyched by the look of the white, high-gloss lacquer Sektion option.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-27638 size-full" title="close-up of kitchen drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="702" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-10-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The cost-benefit of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/galley-kitchen-renovation-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing IKEA kitchen cabinets</a> for a completely new look was immediately evident: for well under $10K, Lee got a full set of high gloss kitchen cabinets <em>and</em> was really happy with the quality. The downside? Getting delivery right took weeks of follow-up and re-shipments to get all of the pieces on site. It was a great deal overall, but most definitely not without headaches and hand-holding.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27651 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="713" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-300x214.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-06-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

<p>Lee&#8217;s research paid off in other parts of the kitchen. He loved the look of white marble and spent six months on the hunt for a quartz countertop with a similar feel, ultimately landing on a porcelain slab by Euro West with an almost-identical yet indestructible effect.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sweeten made the process super easy to get bids and ultimately find a great contractor. I&#8217;m really glad I found you guys.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27652 size-full" title="IKEA kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg" alt="IKEA kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="715" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-300x215.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_LeeKitchenBath-08-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To stay on budget, Lee decided to skip a typical tiled backsplash. With the newly-opened room, and with an upper row of cabinets only on one side, it ended up being a smart choice. Lee thought carefully about cabinet placement<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>drawers only along the left (16&#8243; depth to maximize open space) and a slim row of upper cabinets centered on the right. The team installed the counter-depth Liebherr fridge against the back wall and lined up all other appliances: a Samsung stove, a stainless steel Blomberg dishwasher, and a Blanco Quatrus sink on the opposite side. Their placement left plenty of room in all directions for food prep and hosting.</p>

<h3>Starting from scratch for the bathroom refresh</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as Lee <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started this project</a>, he knew he had little sentimental feelings about the bathroom. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan for the bathroom</a> was straightforward: Everything had to go. In its place, the room would receive a lot of clean, bright whites and crisp glass. He selected a touchless San Souci Kohler toilet, &#8220;designed for OCD people,&#8221; in his words, and a Kohler recessed medicine cabinet above the Fresca sink vanity. The bathroom hardware is all Hansgrohe; a full shower suite with all of its bells and whistles. Lee&#8217;s heavy research brought in one more big catch: he found a specialty <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass shower door</a> from Mirage Shower Doors that eliminates the slight green aura that lots of shower doors end up with. Glassos white wall tiles were the final reflective touch.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Historic brownstone, close to trains, and a (relatively) affordable neighborhood. These were our criteria when we selected Crown Heights as our new home. A few years ago, we had moved out of the city to Long Island, but immediately missed our friends and the shorter commute. Janet, who runs the New York School of Design, a fashion design school, wanted to have input on the layout and fittings of our new home. So we decided to limit our search to townhouses that needed a gut renovation. We only looked at listings which included the term “bring your architect”—you know the type.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After many open houses and a fierce bidding war, we were given the keys to a four-family brownstone that “had good bones” but needed a little TLC. During our initial walk-through as new homeowners, it suddenly hit us—the prospect of such a big renovation was really daunting! We used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matched us to our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architects</a>. Sweeten also suggested three different contractors who each made proposals. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our general contractor </a>and together, we got started.</p>
<p>The goal of our townhouse renovation was to create the perfect mix of old and new. We loved pre-war architecture and wanted to preserve as much of the original detail as possible. During this process, we worked with our architect to think of ways to match the original detail with newer materials. We wanted to rethink the apartment layouts and convert the two-bedroom units to large one bedrooms. In addition to updating the kitchens and baths, we hoped that an open layout would feel brighter and more spacious. Due to budget and timing, we decided to renovate the four apartments in two phases. At the time of this blog post, two apartments are finished. We are currently living in one of them and preparing to rent it out after the other units are complete.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39968" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the demo phase, a lot of time was spent assessing what could be restored and what needed to go. The contractor tried to salvage the original ceiling medallions, but they crumbled once the nearby popcorn ceilings were removed. In the kitchen, it was a pleasant surprise when we found excellent condition hardwood floor underneath the linoleum. We were elated when we discovered that the stairways were in great condition and could be refinished (apparently, new stairs are very expensive). It was a rough day when we found out that the main supporting beam for the building (wooden and over 100 years old) needed to be replaced with a steel beam—a big unforeseen expense. But we were thankful that the general contractor was meticulous and didn’t take any shortcuts in safety.</p>

<blockquote><p>We had weekly walk-throughs with our architect and contractor. I realized that this was very important and ensured that the project progressed smoothly.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39972 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39976 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />After demo, we then installed new electrical, plumbing, and gas heating. Next came the framing of the walls to create the new floor plan. The layout is what really makes the apartment special. We joined the living room and an adjacent closet so that the entire area is larger. This created a small alcove, which is now a quiet sitting area bathed in natural light. The living room then flows into the kitchen and dining area. Eight-foot French doors separate the kitchen from the bedroom. The doors, even when closed, allow more light to flow into the apartment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The kitchen was very important to us. We like to cook, so we really wanted extra counter space and built-in butcher block. Gray cabinetry and shelving were arranged to maximize storage space, and we incorporated mixed-material countertops, as well as a sink, fridge, and dishwasher—all from IKEA. We chose a counter-depth refrigerator, which fit perfectly into </span>the space<span style="color: #333333;">. A geometric </span>tile<span style="color: #333333;"> backsplash brings it all together.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom is large enough for a king-size bed. We kept the existing wall between the kitchen and bedroom but converted the old kitchen into a dressing room. The dressing room is Janet&#8217;s favorite space. It has a huge closet, room for seating, and a full-sized washer and dryer. The bathroom has two entrances—one from the kitchen/dining area and a pocket door from the dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The window moldings and crowns are all original. We decided to paint them black to contrast with the lighter wall colors. All the doors are original and were reconditioned and adjusted to fit properly. We chose egg-shaped door knobs. Picture rail moldings and new ceiling medallions were added. In the hallways, we restored the original wainscoting and created new panels to fill in missing or damaged areas.</p>

<p>The bathroom was also designed to mix old and new. We chose a sink and toilet that would go well with the traditional fixtures. For added towel storage, we installed a separate rack. We chose to use elongated tiles, a twist on the traditional subway tiles. The matte texture of the hexagon floor tiles feels amazing on bare feet!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building exterior also underwent a facelift. We first removed the &#8217;70s screen door and awning. The exterior cornice was repainted black, allowing its architectural detail to shine. We chose a color called &#8220;Velvet Plum&#8221; for the main exterior. We splurged and replaced the front door with historically-accurate mahogany double doors. While this was not cheap, it’s one of our favorite things about the building.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All this sounds like a lot of work and it truly was. During the build-out phase, we had weekly walk-throughs with our architect and contractor. I realized that this was very important and ensured that the project progressed smoothly. Even though there were detailed architectural plans and specifications, there were often unforeseen circumstances that would require a quick decision. These meetings and open communication with the contractor helped avoid delays and insured that the build-out was to our liking. Because we watched as things were being done, we often gave last-minute input and even changed our minds about things a few times.</p>
<p>For those of you out there who are planning to do a similar project, I highly recommend that you be involved. I know it’s tempting to think, “Hey, I’m paying these people A LOT to do this for me and I just want to see the final result.” That’s understandable. But, although it’s time-consuming and a bit of a pain, I guarantee that you’ll get a better end result if you are involved in the process like we were. In addition, your choice of general contractor is extremely important. Since this was our first renovation, we had put a lot of trust in our team. We feel really fortunate that our contractor was honest and didn’t try to nickel and dime us on every little thing.</p>
<p>Looking back, we really didn’t know what we were getting into with such a big project (we blame cable TV renovation shows for misleading us). But, fortunately, with guidance from our architect and general contractor, the process ended up to be very positive. We absolutely love our new home!</p>

<em>Guest post by Jenna, Chelsea homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our three-bedroom, two-bath home in Chelsea in 2008. At first, we painted and got rid of the popcorn ceiling but otherwise had a long, outstanding list of items to complete after our initial move in. My husband and I were expecting our first child six years later and thought: what better time to renovate a home than a few months before the baby is due! We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Upon our first meeting, it was clear that he was willing to indulge my creative side and workshop out-of-the-box ideas along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was eager to modernize and lighten the home. Over the years, I lost patience with the worn parquet maple floor and the mismatched color palette in the kitchen. Every surface in the home needed a facelift. And with a baby on the way, we had the very immediate challenge of creating a nursery and guest bedroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19146 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19145" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jenna_apartment-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, we replaced the countertops, floors, cabinet doors, and backsplash. My goal was to create a soft, clean space—bringing in details like a slate floor and light gray marble backsplash to complement the natural floor tiles. I added agate and stone knobs on the cabinets and drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m in the process of creating a &#8220;bucket list&#8221; installation for the remaining wall, though I&#8217;m enjoying the space the empty wall creates. I went with an all-white countertop with no veins as I simply couldn’t find a slab that I was excited about in my price range. Everything, even the natural granite, looked man-made.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to feel like I was in a luxurious hotel bathroom when I was at home, so I opted for softer lighting and intricate tile work in both bathrooms. I hate seeing soap bottles from outside a shower, so our contractor’s team embedded four shelves into the wall along the shower structure. I purchased the sink base from IKEA but had custom marble tops made and chose sconces over harsh bathroom lighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gray floors are obviously in, but mostly because they substantially soften the weight of a room. In fact, it’s the first thing people notice when they see the ‘before and after’. We added taller baseboards which also add height to each room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We re-carpeted the two bedrooms on the lower level, white shag in the baby’s room as I knew lots of people would be hanging out on the floor with the baby, and white patterned carpet everywhere else. My friends with kids told me I was crazy for choosing white but so far the baby has accommodated the need to keep it clean!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The baby’s room needed to be cozy, magical, and PRACTICAL. The tree that hovers over the baby’s crib is made of the tree trunks from the four posts of the huppah at our wedding. I’ve created and commissioned a series of dream catchers that float among the branches (not over the crib!) from treasures I’ve collected all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was very grateful to our contractor for helping in the final details of the nursery—his team secured some elements of the changing table and helped hang some of the complicated wall hangings that I insisted on having.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after Claudia purchased her one-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a quaint Upper East Side co-op, she felt ready to renovate. Since arriving in 2001, this software engineer knew that she’d eventually need to address the 30 year-old carpeting, fixtures, and odd space issues&#8230;or simply move on and find a new home. Loving everything about the building, the neighborhood, and her lifestyle, she decided to stay put and find a designer who could bring an architectural approach and a restorative eye to this lovely space. Read on for the stunning reveal of Claudia’s thoughtful and personal apartment renovation!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18472 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg" alt="apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/claudia-apartment-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia first readied herself with a straightforward list of tasks she wanted to accomplish. Sure, the place hadn’t been updated anywhere in three decades, so finishes throughout were more than dated. But she also craved more space, and after seeing neighboring units without the built-ins and boxy windows that had been added in a mid-80s renovation, she realized she might be able to reclaim some hidden square footage (and long-missing electrical outlets) in her own unit. The kitchen and bathroom needed a complete treatment, and the living room and bedroom required diametrically opposed designs: out with chunky built-ins on multiple walls in the living room, and in with a thoughtful and multi-functional built-in for the windowed bedroom wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18334 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18333 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18336 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-05-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18335 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-04-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18332" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishlist near complete, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia decided to post her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was matched with a Sweeten contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who specializes in creating architecture and interior design solutions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon meeting with Frederick and his team, Claudia made an overarching goal clear: She wasn’t interested in solely installing modern finishes over the old. The original bones were just as important as the final coat of paint. That pristine 1929 appeal needed to show through and reveal itself via new design details. With extensive renovations planned in every room, Claudia moved out of the apartment temporarily to allow for Frederick and his crew to get started. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia believed that original parquet floors were hiding underneath all the carpeting, and she was right. Frederick had the wood floors sanded and refinished, bringing them back to life without introducing any new materials. With extra sheetrock walls encroaching in multiple directions, the team chipped away at the wall of boxed windows, disposing of an 18 inch layer of brick and wood. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avert your eyes if you live in a typical NYC co-op, because you will probably NEVER experience this, but somehow Claudia nearly doubled the size of her living room windows by combining them, flooding the space with lovely natural light. All of the windows were replaced with double-paned versions, up to code with the building and boasting the required heat, freeze and UV protections. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite end of the room, the crew stripped away the ever-so-slightly-asymmetrical built-in shelving and cabinetry to reveal an open, wood-burning hearth. Claudia turned to a local Italian couple who specialize in old world mantels for an understated limestone facade, and Frederick brought in a specialist to design and install crown moldings along the doorways, windows, ceiling and floor boards throughout the apartment. Claudia’s mother helped source the final touch: an accent wall in a serene, neutral palette is an elegant and stylish addition to an inviting new living room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen, Claudia knew she wanted a white kitchen and was unsentimental about getting rid of the “horrible” gray linoleum floors. Cosmetic features aside, she wanted more storage space and a way to install an exhaust fan over a new cooktop. In an attempt to carve out some casual eating space, the previous owners had put some very limited cabinetry along the left-side of the galley, and appliances took up most of the storage and prep space on the right side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia chose a small pearlescent stone tile in a melange of pebble hues to take the place of the severely dated synthetic floor she’d grown to detest. High-impact cabinet changes were custom fit into the small space. Claudia worked with an Italian purveyor specializing in hidden compartments for the fridge and hood, and managed to conceal all of the major stainless steel appliances except for the striking new Bertazzoni range, because, Bertazzoni! The laminate countertops were removed and replaced with a white Caesarstone slab and corresponding backsplash, and an undermount stainless sink&#8211;supplied by the same producer as the cabinets&#8211;was installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18452 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="white Caesarstone countertop" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18453 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-06-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18454 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="stainless undermount sink" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18455" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-08-10.gif" alt="Bertazzoni range" width="600" height="797" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia knew she didn’t need to change the footprint of her bathroom to incorporate the many features she wanted here. The tub needed two shower curtains to keep water in, the full surround of blue-gray tile muted natural light, and the bulky vanity was topped with a throwback plastic ball faucet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia went with a floor tile pick that is complementary but different to those used in the kitchen, and with Frederick’s help, incorporated extra pieces into a design detail border along the wall of freshly installed white subway tiles. The tub came out and was replaced with a slightly larger and more modern German piece to coincide with new spa accessories: a rainwater shower head plus a handheld option for added luxe. The fixed shower rod was taken down to make way for a glass partition and hinged glass door that swings out for maximum function and style. Claudia chose a pedestal sink for extra floor and knee space, opting to place storage behind hidden cabinets in the wall instead. Almost all of the bathroom features were handpicked from local design shop Elegance in Hardware, including the polished nickel door knobs, which are exclusive to the outlet.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bedroom, Claudia and her design-build team pursued the opposite approach. Instead of doing away with built-ins, they found areas where custom additions would have a meaningful impact on space use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They added a custom closet in the hallway, outfitted  by California Closets, just outside the bath before entering the living room and introduced this same custom storage concept in the bedroom, behind a mirrored closet wall—one of the only major features that remained. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the carpet was torn out in the bedroom, Claudia approached Frederick with her hopes of incorporating a window seat before new wall treatment and molding went in. The designer re-enlisted his subcontractor to fashion a custom wooden seat built right into the new shelving set. The homeowner would just need an upholstered cushion and good book to make it complete.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claudia revealed to us that upon visiting her apartment, after the renovations were complete and the dust had nearly cleared, she stood and looked around the empty rooms and was filled with the sense that nothing had changed. It was as if she were apartment shopping in 1929, which, she explained, is exactly what she wanted.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello again from Crown Heights! We were treated to a summer tour of Colin and Orli&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/colin-and-orlis-sweetened-crown-heights-work-studio-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super creative work studio</a> and we&#8217;re back this week for a full look at the new bathroom, kitchen, and living room in their two bedroom co-op. This scenic and costume designer pair is no stranger to creating transporting spaces and pieces for the theater, but they needed heavy duty help to deal with five layers of rotting floor tiles in the bathroom and fire damage hidden behind the kitchen walls. We dispatched a Sweeten expert for huge overhauls in both rooms and for custom replica and restoration work throughout the apartment, and we were so intrigued by the possibilities in this unique space that we took identical sets of before, during, and after photos that reveal how much work went into re-creating this home. Read on through for the full story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="diningroom-hardwood-floors-kitchen-with-walnut-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47788 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg" alt="photo of dining room with hardwood floors and crown molding and trims and another photo of kitchen with black granite countertop and walnut cabinets and tile floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14162"></span>Colin and Orli knew they had a major project on their hands before closing on the place. The most significant demolition was needed in the bathroom, which had accumulated five different layers of floor tiles, all glued down over each other through multiple renovation attempts spanning decades. The extra floor heft was especially obvious when you stepped down into the tub &#8211; the unexpected drop was enough to catch a visitor off guard. Water damage and rotting materials extended throughout the room and down through the floorboards and joists. Pedro&#8217;s team needed to replace some of the studs, level the joists, and work through plumbing all the way back to the building&#8217;s stacks. In the kitchen, the couple intended to keep the general footprint, but uncovered fire damage from a previous tenant inside the walls. Studs with char marks, several layers of cracked flooring, and non-level sub-flooring required structural work before the fun fixtures and appliances could come anywhere near the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="dark-green-square-bathroom-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47793 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with dark green square wall tiles and walk in shower with glass dors and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Colin and Orli came up big with two distinctive tile choices in the bathroom. They headed straight for the unfailingly classic and vintage appeal of black and white hex tiles, and picked up a case of each at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/Bathroom_Tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. The path to new wall tile was not quite as direct &#8211; the couple admittedly agonized over finding the right color &#8211; something that would be saturated and bright, luminous and with a hand-painted feel. With a Starbucks-green glaze in mind, they found exactly what they wanted in a ceramic tile at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/ceramic/mcintones_ceramics/ceramic_tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a>. Complete Tile also nailed all of the possible tile configurations, allowing Pedro and his team to work with rounded bullnose, chair rail, and corner tiles all in the same coordinating hues. To save the bathroom from future water damage, they picked up a new tub and fully enclosed it with tile and a sliding glass door. Pedro installed a <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/inspiration-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville</a> vanity topped with granite from <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> and fixtures from <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faucet Direct</a>, where they also found their new eco-flush toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Colin and Orli selected ceramic floor tiles that mimic a slate feel with organic color variation (many tiles in this style have texture or color variation that is digitally printed on top, but not these). They ordered <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville cabinetry</a> from Home Depot in a whiskey black finish, which gives the kitchen a weathered, craftsman feel. They found the cabinet hardware on <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build.com</a>, whose order and return policy made it easy to directly compare more than a dozen finishes. The new countertop has become a deeply loved piece &#8211; at the <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> shop, it was covered in a layer of dust and didn&#8217;t reveal it&#8217;s rich blue, green, and black translucent depth until it arrived for installation. All the appliances are from <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Madison</a>: the stove is a <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Kitchen-Appliances/Ranges/Gas-Range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fridgidaire</a> 5-burner, the fridge is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> with french doors which leave just enough room to swing open in the galley, and the modern sink faucet is <a href="https://www.moen.com/kitchen/sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>. To finish the look, Colin and Orli wrapped the room in an antique silver gloss tin backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.americantinceilings.com/shop-backsplashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tin Ceiling Company</a>. They managed the faux finish on the walls themselves using a basic rag roll glazing technique (but substituting lace for the rag) and finishing things off with a soft blending brush, using a similar technique that was used in the living room.  The barn light above the dining area is from <a href="https://www.barnlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barn Light Electric</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Pedro sanded and finished the floors to preserve the original wood and inlay border with a high gloss luster. To conceal the steam heat pipe in the living room corner, Pedro boxed out the section and added a decorative grill from <a href="https://aagrilles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Architectural Grills</a>. While the work in the living room was largely cosmetic, Colin and Orli are grateful to Pedro for his painstaking replicas of much of the building&#8217;s original details. Pedro custom-built the floating shelves to carry the same ornate lines of the picture rail molding. He was also able to largely match the trim molding that had previously existed with support from Dyke&#8217;s Lumber. However, since the door and window casements were not available off the rack, he went the extra mile and personally cut hundreds of feet of trim material to match the original art deco detail Colin and Orli loved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re shifting gears from the usual fare of NYC bath and kitchen renovations to look at how one Upper West Sider made custom changes in every room of a two-bed, two-bath co-op to accommodate her incredible collection of art and books. If you&#8217;ve never seen a full-size Terracotta Warrior sculpture in a Manhattan home, today is your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13050" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;I would have been lost &#8211; Sweeten solved the problem of where to begin and the service was amazing. Within two hours of posting my project, I started getting matches. My Sweeten designer was completely on top of everything while I was out of town for four months. I walked out of one apartment in July and into another in October.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8211; Christine, Manhattan homeowner</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first sign that Christine had a very specific vision for her New York home came when she was looking at apartments to buy back in 2008. Her top real estate demand? The new place could be no more than ten blocks from Zabar&#8217;s! After finding a combined unit in a boom-era Rosario Candela building, Christine was thrilled with the gracious and spacious layout (a full dining room in which to serve all of her Zabar&#8217;s selections!) but began to imagine a renovation that would replace the outdated finishes and decade-old paint job. The place was absolutely livable and Christine didn&#8217;t know where to start to find professionals for an upgrade, so years passed before she felt ready to take on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a designer who could help her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create significant storage options and lighting</a> for her extensive library and varied art pieces. Beyond the usual must-haves, Christine also needed someone who could manage the project on her behalf while she spent the summer months in Maine. Most homeowners would be understandably anxious about skipping town while major renovations were underway, but we introduced Christine to this Sweeten designer who signed on to shepherd Christine&#8217;s wish list through to completion and find a home for all of the pieces in the collection.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine and her designer set out to solve five major issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.</strong> Fresh paint on everything in sight, stat!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.</strong> Crown molding and door frames were mismatched and had been thickly painted during past renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.</strong> The kitchen needed a new floor and backsplash tiles and a to-be-determined facelift for the cabinetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong> Lighting overhead was no help when Christine wanted to read, cook, and spotlight her favorite works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.</strong> The apartment&#8217;s storage and display options were no match for Christine&#8217;s collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer brought in a team to hit each of these to-do&#8217;s and added her own expertise to help Christine find materials that she would love. In the living room, the designer suggested <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=pewter&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Pewter</a> &#8211; Christine loved the neutral selection and ultimately decided to repeat it in other rooms. Custom shelving for the living room and dining room and new crown molding installations unified the rooms and provide a consistent backdrop for the wall to wall book collection. Throughout the design and installation of each new element, the designer kept Christine up to date via regular Skype calls and photo messages, and translated Christine&#8217;s preferences for shelving height, library lighting, and finishes to the crew. When an order snafu resulted in a delivery of picture lighting without a dimming feature, her designer stepped in, made her way all the way to the president of the company that created the lighting, and managed to get a full set of replacements at no extra charge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13048" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the designer found an ornate cement encaustic tile from <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic House</a> to replace cracked ceramic floor tiles. Christine loves the look and feel of these and immediately took to her designer&#8217;s suggestion for handmade, hexagonal backsplash tiles in various shades of white and gray. The crew debated refreshing the kitchen cabinets with a new coat of paint but ultimately decided to replace them altogether with brand new doors and detailed pulls. Under-cabinet LED lighting helped meet Christine&#8217;s call for more lighting in the kitchen, and crisp molding now provides a beautiful transition from the ground up.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">-Anishka Clarke tS member &amp; co-owner of Ishka Designs</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/park-slope-apartment-interior-makeover/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10092" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png" alt="00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The owner of this bright, 750sqft 1-bed in Park Slope works for one of the top 3 consulting firms in the US which means she works long hours and weekends, and travels a ridiculous amount for work &#8212; then, when she gets a break, she&#8217;s back out the door, traveling for leisure. Though she spends so much of her time away from home, she still finds time to &#8220;live&#8221; in each room and entertain regularly. When she first purchased her apartment a couple years ago, however, its vibe wasn&#8217;t right for her lifestyle, and she contacted tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402">Ishka Designs</a>, co-owned by Anishka Clarke &amp; Niya Bascom, to help make it her own. The Ishka team transformed the dark, cramped apartment into a relaxing oasis where this homeowner can unwind after her usual busy day or weeklong work trip, and likewise, its sophisticated, urban character makes it a perfect place to entertain high-level clients &amp; colleagues.<span id="more-10004"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10130" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg" alt="01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt Before" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation — the apartment was painted in various colors from room to room which made the spaces feel disjointed, and in general, many of the existing finishes weren&#8217;t aligned with the homeowner&#8217;s tastes. The furniture around the home was also clunky and needed updating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10009" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovated bedroom is bright and tranquil. Anishka &amp; Niya chose to use a soft white paint, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/962/gray-mist?color=962">BM Grey Mist</a>, throughout the apartment&#8217;s walls to amplify natural daylight and continuity between spaces. The bed was designed custom by Ishka Designs; we love how they&#8217;ve created the illusion that it&#8217;s actually floating in the space, without any legs or structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than using more traditional nightstands, the designers chose <a href="https://www.cb2.com/peekaboo-clear-nesting-tables-set-of-three/f117">acrylic nesting tables from CB2</a> which add to the weightlessness of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10069" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the new bathroom design, they created a relaxing, Zen-like spa atmosphere, using subtle textures, a neutral color  palette, and clean lines.  The vanity is a custom unit made of walnut with marine-grade sealant; it was built by our friends at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors who were the contractors for the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10012" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design team also created a custom media unit for the living room. The unit was designed not only to fit the space and character of the new home, but to perform specific functions for the client and keep the decor uncluttered. They also incorporated the room&#8217;s non-functional chimney as an extension of the media unit. It took a little convincing to get the homeowner onboard with painting the exposed brick, but it was definitely worthwhile, as the result really helps brighten the space and fits much better with the decor&#8217;s clean and pure aesthetic. The designers purchased the <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19620&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=143">Portica coffee table</a> and <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19434&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=198">Loring sofa</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10015" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anishka &amp; Niya sourced all of the artwork in the space from local, Brooklyn artists. The painting featured here in the dining space is by artist Jamal Ince; the vibrant piece makes a great compliment to the dining chairs by <a href="https://www.robertallendesign.com/">Robert Allen</a>. The dining table is by  <a href="https://www.mgbwhome.com/">Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10071" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flowers and houseplants are the perfect accessories for the nature-inspired interior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10072" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This thoughtful interior puts us right at ease, it&#8217;s truly sublime. Awesome work and many thanks to Ishka Designs!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Special thanks also to Niya Bascom, Photographer &amp; Executive Director of Ishka Designs, for sharing these beautiful photos.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30927" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Yityng-Closet-WineBar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>This week we stopped in to see a finished project that was awarded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. The homeowners converted their under-stair closet space into a personal wine bar in an apartment on the Upper West Side. The new bar-topped niche is the perfect place to store and display the couples&#8217; wine collection, and it also doubles as a breakfast bar, making it an expansion of their small galley kitchen. Happy with their new space, the homeowners told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor was very professional, contactable (important!), and has great suggestions. [We] would definitely recommend his team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-01" width="600" height="804" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is the photo the homeowners included when <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project to Sweeten</a> showing their double-door, under-stair closet space. The closet would be just the right fit for a wine cooler, cabinet, and wall-mounted shelving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19540" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-02" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The couple already had some ideas in mind for wood shelving. Here are some of their inspiration images which they also posted to their project on Sweeten.</p>
<p><span id="more-5187"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The work began last month when their contractor cleared out the space, giving it smooth walls, fresh paint, and wired new lighting for the bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19542" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and install the small cabinet and wine-cooler. The homeowners chose this cabinet from the <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart</a> collection available at Home Depot the style is Weston in Persian Grey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19546 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19553 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the finished view &#8211;we love the clever use of space! As well as the pop of color added by the red Tabouret stools, available on <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tabouret-24-inch-Red-Metal-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/5095629/product.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The homeowners chose an elegant bartop in Carrara marble, also available through <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Countertop-Samples/Stonemark-Granite/N-5yc1vZc3boZb0i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Above, wine bottles are displayed on reclaimed wood shelving from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>. The homeowners told us that they opted against custom shelving when they found these attractive shelves for such a great price. However, their contractor pointed out that the iron shelf brackets are a perfect match to the apartment&#8217;s stair railing—so, in the end, these off-the-shelf shelves actually appear customized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>New lamps with dimmers were also added. We love the hand-blown look of the pendants, similar to this glass pendant available at <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/clift-seeded-glass-pendant/?pkey=cchandeliers-pendants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Barn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19549" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-05" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget how essential our storage is &#8211;they&#8217;ve got just enough cabinet space to keep the niche looking clean and stylish, with all the extras stowed away.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to the homeowners for sharing their awesome new wine bar!</em></p>
