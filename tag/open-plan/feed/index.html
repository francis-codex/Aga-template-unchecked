										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With spaces that flow and connect, reimagine the way they can be lived in</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An open floor plan provides plenty of space to get creative. Instead of each room having a distinct purpose or design, the layout offers a multifunctional space with unified decor. Combining the living and dining rooms has many benefits; for one, hosting parties is much easier when guests aren’t confined to a single dining room. The larger space lends itself to a more social atmosphere that brings the whole family together and feels cozy rather than cramped. Ready to embrace open-plan living? Take inspiration from the Sweeten renovations below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsha and Adam</a> took down walls on the main floor of their brownstone to connect the living and dining rooms. Rugs define the borders for each space in a way that doesn’t feel as isolated as dividing walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-31170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren</a> shifted her living room furniture closer to the windows and carved out a spot for a table and chairs, a setup that wouldn’t have fit in the original layout. The long-awaited dining area makes it possible for her to finally have friends over for dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29277" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, it became clear that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan</a> needed to add walls to their open-plan loft to create two separate bedrooms. The dining area was moved closer to the living room furniture and replaced with a long table with bench seating that mirrors the length of the couch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of a formal dining room led <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather and Eric</a> to embrace the combined living and dining area in their newly purchased apartment. Choosing all-white furniture for the couch, table, and chairs makes the arrangement feel more intentional and coordinated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28216" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Kam_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After converting part of the living room into a second bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah and Craig</a> moved their living room furniture next to the dining table. The new and improved layout creates a central hub for gatherings that isn&#8217;t far from the built-in bar.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate and open up a kitchen in a Ditmas Park, Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lindsay, a director at Brooks Brothers, and Roger, a director in pre-sales at StyleLabs, purchased their 1,075-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in 2016. Roger “loves to play around in the kitchen,” said his wife, Lindsay. While the kitchen was dark, outdated, and not very functional, the space also didn&#8217;t offer a clear sight line between the kitchen and living room. “We wanted a more family-friendly space, opened up so whoever was in the kitchen could interact with family and friends in the living room,&#8221; they said. &#8220;And we wanted some kind of island/breakfast bar.” After living in the co-op for about a year, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and planned a renewed flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32796 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lindsay was about nine months pregnant during the renovation, something she wouldn’t recommend to anyone doing a remodel. “The challenge of trying to get around the apartment that was in complete disrepair was interesting on some days,” she said. “We ended up moving the entire kitchen and living room into the nursery. I’d recommend going on a vacation or taking a long weekend trip during the major part of the construction. You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Sweeten contractor</a> “knew we wanted to get everything done in time for the baby to come<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a little bit of time to spare to clean up the nursery,” Lindsay said. “They were good at communicating what the status was, how long something was going to take, and how much time we had to make a decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33272 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-3-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Before-3" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LindsayConnolly Kitchen07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job was basically a “rip-and-replace” with a new peninsula where the wall between the kitchen and living space once stood. The only appliance that moved was the refrigerator, which stayed on the same wall. For the cabinets, their contractor recommended <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen designer in the Sweeten network</a>. The kitchen designers provided the initial custom cabinet layout, then Lindsay visualized the usability of the kitchen. “I mapped all of our stuff from pantry and appliances to a drawer or cabinet. Then I was able to work with our contractor to determine the best shelf or drawer configuration to utilize the space and fit our stuff,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32807 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32812 mb-0 size-chrono" title="light-brown-cabinets-white-quartz-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" alt="light brown wooden cabinets and white quartz counter and gray walls after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo chose an island/breakfast bar so guests would feel like a part of the cooking process. Tall cabinets like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> gave them more storage with pull-out drawers for easy access and a large drawer for their spices. A separate small counter and shelves stand in as their “coffee bar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the difficulties of being pregnant and having to move things during the renovation, Lindsay felt it would have been easier had they spent more time deciding on appliances in advance and budgeting in the little things like cabinet hardware, lighting, faucet, and sink. “You’ve got to be flexible and open-minded to extending your timeline if something is not available immediately, or finding a substitute material.” She also would have raised her <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost expectations</a> another $5,000 to $10,000. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval.” (See Bonus section below.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32797 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32803 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32810 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay cautions other first-timers to be prepared to pay a fee to show a copy of a license for plumbers and electricians, a fee for an engineer to review the design, and a fee for the management company and/or board to review and approve. There were several back-and-forth discussions to get the paperwork exactly right for the approval. “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the bumps, Lindsay and Roger—and now Porter, born in January just after the project was finished—are delighted to be able to entertain family and friends from their new, open kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32800 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had actually posted this project on Sweeten twice. There were “politics,” Lindsay said, in getting it approved through the co-op. “We thought we could just submit the design and it would be approved,” she said. “The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval process</a> for our co-op board was multi-level, which we didn’t understand when we first posted.”</p>
<p>They removed their posting and Sweeten’s client services helped Lindsay rewrite it and narrow down the choices while they searched for a contractor match. Once they found a potential match, several other factors were required by the board, and their contractors “took the time to go through the copy of the board requirements before we officially selected them,” Lindsay said. “As a first-time renovator and co-op owner, we were happy to have a little guidance from someone who has been through this process before.” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A change of plans results in a home to grow into for the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Melissa and Blake were on the hunt for a two-bedroom apartment in their beloved neighborhood of Gramercy for years with little to no luck. When the search felt hopeless, they readjusted their expectations, setting their sights on large, one-bedroom units that could be renovated to fit their needs. Fortunately, the new angle proved successful, and the couple came across an older co-op with good bones and plenty of windows and storage, providing them with the perfect canvas to shape their new home. Read on for Melissa’s take on their resourceful home renovation!</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-936x667.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had been looking for a two-bedroom apartment under $1 million for years. We knew that for that price, we&#8217;d need to find a “wreck” and fix it up, but we weren’t willing to compromise on location, lots of windows, air conditioners that were NOT in the window, good closet space, a doorman, an elevator, reasonable maintenance, and as much square footage as we could get. Pretty much impossible. But when we started looking at large one-bedrooms that we could convert to a two-bedroom, we began to see a few possibilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28652" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28781 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FloorPlan-B_A-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment we got had everything we wanted except that it had lime-green walls with dark green moldings everywhere (except in the pink bedroom; it had rose-colored moldings), an original ‘50s-style bathroom and kitchen, and a huge closet (3’ deep x 7’ long) added to a wall right as you walked into the apartment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28897 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28644" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<blockquote><p>None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any contractors they had used.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started looking for contractors right away to get an idea of cost. None of our friends who live in NYC wanted to recommend any they had used. One Sunday morning, we were watching NBC’s &#8220;Open House&#8221; and saw an ad for Sweeten. We did some research online and everyone who used the site seemed really happy with the results. We liked the fact that they did background checks on the contractors and had reviews from other people who had actually used the contractor. There was nothing to lose, so <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our job</a> to be matched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We met with three contractors (all responded to us within hours) and learned something from every one of them. We hadn’t thought about the floors (they needed to either be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replaced or refinished</a>), <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doors </a>(they were all hollow and flimsy), or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">electrical wiring</a> (some of the ceiling fixtures were not exactly “legal”). The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one we chose was the last contractor we met with</a> and spent the most time with probably because we knew he was the “one.” We explained what we wanted to do and he responded with what was possible, what was necessary, what choices we had to save money, and what we would regret not doing. He took our “vision” for the kitchen and prepared plans that we all reworked until they were right. Our list got longer and our budget got larger, but thanks to his experience, we felt confident the right choices were being made. He also has a kitchen and bath showroom, where we picked out most of our materials with considerable help and advice from him and his office administrator Dede.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28643 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28646" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-15" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At our closing, we had all the materials needed for the co-op board’s renovation package done and ready to be filed. Our contractor had a lot of experience renovating NYC co-ops and knew all the insurance, licensing, and millions of details that are involved with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">board submissions</a>. His office administrator was on top of everything and made that part of the process a breeze. There was some back and forth with the co-op manager and their architects approving the job—July and August may not have been the best time to get approvals when the world is on vacation!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28642 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-Before-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Before shots of the front door and closet (l.) and kitchen (r.)<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28898 mt-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt02-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally started at the end of August and moved in the first week of November, although the guys didn’t completely finish until mid-November. Our contractor’s crew, run by his brother Benny, were all such great guys. They were at the site every day, all day, working hard, so progress was easy to see. They never left without cleaning and mopping. They were very considerate of our neighbors throughout the renovation. Our new building super stopped by from time to time to check on the work and told us he was impressed with the quality of their efforts.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28649 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28648" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-07-09" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we love about our new apartment is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan</a> that resulted from tearing out the big closet and the walls surrounding the kitchen and connecting the kitchen to the living room. The whole place is brighter now with the light from the kitchen window. We have so much more space with a bar and stools and lots of cabinets. The tile backsplash, counters, and floors are different textures and work really well with the white cabinets, decisions we made with lots of advice from our contractor! We opted to do some things ourselves. We bought closet interiors for the bedroom and front hall closets from Ikea, put them together, and our contractor bolted them into the wall. We purchased custom radiator covers online and assembled them ourselves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28653 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28896" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07.gif" alt="SWEETEN_MelissaBlakeTavss_Apt07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space is still a one-bedroom for now, but it’s designed in such a way that if we need an extra bedroom in the future, we can easily add a wall to the end of the L-shaped living space (which already has its own closet, too). The Ikea <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bedroom closet</a> was a big investment of time that totally paid off. It&#8217;s 11 feet of closet with hanging space, drawers, and interior lights. The three huge sliding doors let us keep it two-thirds open at any one time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28656 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-28655" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom has a frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass tub enclosure</a>, letting in lots of light. Our contractor helped us choose the tiles and recommended the new silver edging, which looks great, as well as the wood-like tile for the floor. We found our bathroom vanity on sale and we ended up with a free bathtub! The tub we ordered was delivered and installed, but the protective paper-surround stayed on until the bathroom was finished. When the paper came off, we saw they had sent the wrong tub. Since it was already installed, the company gave us the only remedy left—a free tub!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Client services at Sweeten checked in with us periodically throughout the whole renovation and were available by phone when we needed them. When the job was finished, we submitted a review of our contractor that we hope helps other people trying to decide on their own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, our “wreck” became a beautiful, bright, modern home where we like to cook together and have friends over, and we feel very comfortable here.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Giving new life to an estate-condition kitchen and living room in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier had already lived in New York City as renters for several years when they made the decision to make the Big Apple their long-term home. This meant a move from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn, which they preferred for its pace and culture. Rentals were considered but ultimately rejected because of their notoriously small kitchens; the couple loves to cook and needed enough space to work together comfortably. An updated unit in the Clinton Hill Co-ops caught their eye—but unfortunately, they were outbid. Then, having fallen in love with the CHCs (as have many other Sweeten renovators before them!), they realized they could buy one of the units that needed work and have the money to spend on a custom renovation. They made their choice based on the layouts that had space for their ideal custom kitchen. In the unit they selected, everything had to go—the dingy wallpaper and paint, bad tile, and a kitchen that hadn’t been touched in decades. The only thing that would remain were the floors, which would be sanded and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a>. They decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> for the job after posting their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Natalie and Cartier achieved the “modern industrial, open-concept feel” they were looking for by demolishing the walls between the old pantry, living room, dining room, and kitchen. “We wanted a lighter feeling in the apartment, given that the ceiling is not particularly high,” Natalie explained. With less obstruction, the custom kitchen was brightened by the windows in the dining nook and spacious enough for the pair to host dinner parties. They also added plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> for storing all of their kitchen equipment. The sink and dishwasher moved to the wall perpendicular to the stove, allowing their Sweeten contractor to increase counter space and improve the custom kitchen’s overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow</a>. The addition of a built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice drawer</a> and cabinets with pull-out drawers meant that there was a designated spot for their kitchen goods—from small appliances to pots and pans. With many moving parts, Natalie and Cartier relied on Christina, their Sweeten Planner, to help stay on top of their renovation in real time throughout their home&#8217;s transformation. They even received a comprehensive digital record documenting their three-month renovation at completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Cartier was keen on having a “smart” home, so the living room air conditioning and many lights are connected via Wi-Fi and controlled by the Echo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Cemento Cassero Anthracite floor tiles: <a href="https://www.arizonatile.com/en/products/porcelain-and-ceramic/cemento-cassero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona Tile</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A closed-in footprint cracks wide open with a floor plan change, a dramatic tile backsplash, and a new dining area</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25802 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen with tile backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Modernizing and improving flow in an awkward kitchen in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: This Sweeten homeowner purchased a two-bedroom co-op apartment in Clinton Hill about a year and a half before posting his project to Sweeten. Although the kitchen was functional, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layout</a> was not ideal. There was a mishmash of storage, none of which was adequate, and walls lacked definition without a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile backsplash</a>. Only a small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> provided the bulk of the work surface. He also wanted to add built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a> for additional storage. With all of this in mind, the homeowner—a first-time renovator—enlisted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> to convert his vision into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: A bright, contemporary kitchen in subtle tones pairs perfectly with a coral accent wall that runs along one side of the kitchen and through the living room. A glass tile backsplash in a mosaic of gray shades is the star of the show. By choosing stainless steel appliances, white cabinets, silver hardware, and a medium gray quartz countertop, the homeowner created a clean backdrop for both the tile backsplash as well as for it to coordinate with the home&#8217;s open plan. Given that the new base cabinetry—with many deep drawers—provide plenty of hidden storage, chunky white shelving was installed instead of upper cabinets for a feeling of openness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: By reconfiguring the kitchen from a U-shape to a galley setup, the Sweeten contractor made way for a dining space with an ample-sized table that easily seats 6 (or more!), and is directly in front of the kitchen’s large window to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>: Glass mosaic backsplash, white flat-front cabinets, gray quartz countertops, silver cabinet hardware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeksha and Joe&#8217;s</a> windowed wall and guest bedroom.</p>
<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>
