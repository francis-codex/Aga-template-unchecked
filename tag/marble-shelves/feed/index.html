<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p>Angela, an epidemiologist, moved to Manhattan from New Jersey and started renting. She loved the city so much, she decided to make it her home. She chose to live at The Manor, a 1928 landmark building in the East 40s, for its grand lobby and beautiful casement windows that overlook a neighborhood park and provide natural light. The only thing due for an update? The co-op’s outdated, flawed bathroom.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45761" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A designer brings ideas for an old bathroom</h3>
<p>She lived in her apartment for several years, doing research and planning before embarking on a renovation. She discovered Sweeten around the same time she found an image of a similar bathroom done by interior designer <a href="https://vonbinteriors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrea Brodfuehrer</a>. “Everything just came together,” Angela said, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a> on Sweeten.</p>
<p>The bathroom wasn&#8217;t in great shape. It had broken tiles, visible pipes, and water shut-off valves near the sink, plus poorly placed ceramic fixtures; like a toilet paper holder installed on the tile wall that was uncomfortably close to the toilet. The outdated bathroom needed storage solutions that worked better than the existing storage areas (the floor, ledges, or open shelving behind the bathroom door.)</p>
<p>Though she knew what she wanted, Angela said, “I barely knew where to start. Seeing <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts like the ones on Sweeten</a> gave me some insight into the process and helped motivate me to take the plunge with the renovation.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="bathroom sink faucet" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45751" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A glamorous, organized white bathroom</h3>
<p>Once she was ready to get estimates and interview contractors, Angela said, “Sweeten client services were there for me, ensuring I found [the contractor] who was the right fit for my project. It helped make the process feel a bit less daunting.” Her Sweeten general contractor was in regular communication with Angela and her designer throughout the process and was responsive to questions, comments, and tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>Stylewise, Angela wanted to keep things simple and classic yet unique. She fell in love with a Kelly Wearstler <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> that Andrea had shown her and admitted it was her favorite part of the bathroom. By contrast, since the floor tile was bold, she chose a white subway tile for the walls with light gray grout for balance.</p>
<p>Angela also included <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble niches and shelves</a>, including one next to the sink that mimicked one she had seen in one of Andrea’s previous designs. In the shower, she opted for a rain showerhead and a handheld; Andrea also suggested including a hook above the shower niche for yet another shower option.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45750" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Angela-Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding bathroom storage solutions</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more storage</a>, a space between the shower and the wall that housed some pipes became tucked-away shelves, perfect for towels and toiletries and a hidden toilet paper holder.</p>
<p>At first, Angela thought that a designer wasn&#8217;t necessary for such a small bathroom with no layout change. But now, she would highly recommend it. Once she met Andrea, they clicked right away. “She had amazing ideas and helped pull things together in a way I couldn&#8217;t have myself,” Angela said.</p>
<p>Overall, the project went smoothly, but Angela was surprised at how difficult it was to see the bathroom reduced to rubble. “Once the general contractor put everything back together, though, that phase of the work seemed like a distant memory,” she recalled.</p>

<h3>Finding the right general contractor</h3>
<p>After initially meeting with a few contractors, Angela realized how important it was to nail down what she really wanted in order to ensure she got comparable estimates. It was essential to get a sense of a contractor’s personality and how well they would work together. “Our contractor made a great first impression when he braved an unusually busy day due to the Women’s March to come to see the bathroom and provide an estimate,” she said. “Renovating can be a relatively short but very intense process, so it’s important to find someone you can trust.&#8221;</p>
