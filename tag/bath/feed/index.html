<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Click to read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs here</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs here</a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With an abundance of Pinterest boards and design blogs, it’s easy to imagine how your dream NYC bathroom could look. If you&#8217;re ready to turn those daydreams into reality, the first crucial step is creating a bathroom remodel budget. To get you started, <span class="s2">Sweeten</span></span><span class="s1"> offers a roadmap of elements that will impact the cost of a bathroom remodel in New York City. Sweeten&#8217;s guide to bathroom remodeling costs, covering building requirements, permits, and design will help nail down your scope and better align real costs with a realistic budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in NYC</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take a look at the overall average cost to remodel a bathroom in New York City, based on Sweeten renovations:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Budget remodel: Starting at <b>$600 </b>psf (per square feet) or <b>$21,000</b> (based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Mid-grade remodel: Starting at <b>$700 </b>psf or <b>$24,500 </b>(based on a 35-sq-ft space)</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">High-end remodel: Starting at <b>$850 </b>psf or <b>$68,000 </b>(based on a 80-sq-ft space)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait. The pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. For homeowners interested in a bathroom renovation, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. You’ll also want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will continue to go up and your material order will start at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Remodeling an NYC bathroom all at once</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it can be tempting to apply à la carte prices to individual elements of the work, a full bathroom renovation is an integrated process that involves design, materials, installation, and plumbing. If your bathroom has one or two areas of concern, you might decide to swap out an individual fixture or two. You can replace a toilet or vanity or take on some limited retiling and pay solely for the cost of the new fixtures and the hours of installation work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, it can be misleading to break up and price out each step of a bathroom remodel. Even if you are just redoing fixtures and tile work, you may discover that you need to replace the sheetrock on the wall or address issues behind the walls, like old valves and ancient drain pipes. A gut renovation, which addresses the whole bathroom space, allows you to plan more broadly. By doing a gut renovation, you can get more work done, in the right sequence, and more cost-effectively.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Budget to high-end costs for bathroom materials and finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Listed below are the visible parts of a bathroom renovation, and probably the aspect you’ve spent the most time thinking about. Review the range of pricing for various fixtures, materials, and finishes in the chart below. On the budget side, you’ll find items sourced from big-box stores like Home Depot, Walmart, or IKEA. Prices increase if you choose to use their interior boxes but upgrade or customize the function or style, such as the door fronts. On the high end are highly customized, handmade, or imported items.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">How much will materials for a bathroom remodel cost?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Wall and floor tile</b>: Budget – <b>$3 per square foot (psf)</b>, Mid-grade – <b>$15 psf</b>, High-end – <b>$35 psf</b> </span></li>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel costs for permits, design, and everything behind-the-scenes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to visible upgrade items, there are unavoidable behind-the-scenes investments to consider when creating your budget.</span></p>
<h4>Building requirements impact bathroom remodeling costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those in apartments, building requirements can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to general <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">alteration agreements</span></a> that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Thomas</a></span><span class="s1"> explained, “Buildings are becoming less flexible on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to raise prices to keep up with those needs.” The contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands. </span></p>
<h4>NYC permit costs for a bathroom remodel</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing services: <b>$2,000 – $3,500</b> and higher </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as<b> $5,000</b> per permit </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackling a NYC bathroom remodel means planning for plumbing services and permits. Any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture requires a permit from the City’s Department of Buildings, which can run up to <b>$2,000 </b>and as high as <b>$5,000</b> per permit. Plumbing is a specialized trade that often comes with hourly rates; expect to budget between <b>$2,000 </b>and<b> $3,500</b> (or higher) for a full bathroom remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re adding outlets or doing electrical work, an electrical permit may be needed, which can run close to <b>$900</b>. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on the building requirements and your plumbing plans, which cost <b>$500 </b>to<b> $1,000</b>.</span></p>
<h4>How design affects bathroom remodel costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the design stage, plan to collaborate with the experts you hire to produce detailed drawings that account for all physical elements of the bathroom. A schematic drawing is usually presented to the building board as part of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">approval process</span></a>, which needs to outline the locations of the major fixtures as well as specifications for the vanity and tub/shower, and lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you plan to move the plumbing to convert a bathtub to a shower or vice versa, the permit alone to change the plumbing in NYC is <strong>$6,000</strong>. This is because you’ll need to hire a registered architect to file a permit application certifying that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. An architect or interior designer will typically charge 15 to 20 percent of the project’s construction costs for his or her fee.</span></p>
<p>Sweeten general contractors can help provide architect referrals for a range of services, saving homeowners a step.</p>
<h4>Demolition and site prep for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this stage, labor is needed to ensure that your bathroom renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be disposed of, which can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. This difficulty will be reflected in the contractor’s rate. Almost without exception, your contractor may need to strip the walls and flooring to frame and level before any installation occurs. This behind-the-scenes step is critical and labor-intensive and can cost an average of <b>$2,000</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If your home is new or the sub-floor is concrete, any leveling needs may be minimal. Otherwise, you probably need to account for floor leveling and new drywall or plastering before any surface work can get going.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Exposing the existing conditions inside walls while leveling and framing will also allow your contractor to address plumbing or electrical issues before you hook up a new plumbing fixture. It may be necessary to replace all horizontal plumbing work to the building’s “stack” (the main vertical lines that run throughout the building) and run new wiring to head off plumbing and electrical problems that you may have unwittingly inherited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll want to factor in costs that support the success and longevity of the work. Examples of this are prep work to protect floors and valuables (which can add <b>$600</b> to<b> $900</b>) and waterproofing steps (which can add <b>$1,000</b>). This is critical for the project’s foundation alignment and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGL_uAFyKzE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Installation is the final stage to incorporate all of the bathroom renovation materials you’ve purchased. The craftsmanship involved in the installation of all the pieces will depend on the size of your bathroom and the degree of customization you need to make all of the pieces fit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PRO TIP: Expect to spend 30 percent or less of your total project cost on visible materials, fixtures, and finishes. The rest will go to behind-the-scenes costs, like labor, permits, and fees.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes for a bathroom renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Raw materials for bathroom renovations</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid-related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurance, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-men crews to much larger entities that employ dozens of staff (including designers, project managers, millworkers and laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, however, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year, though not necessarily dollar for dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s7">Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC contractor Aaron</a> explained that in the last year, there have been specific increases of compliance, certificates, and safety measures imposed on MEP subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) by the Department of Buildings leading to higher costs. </span><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<h4><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;bathroom remodeling new york&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:577,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Bathroom remodeling costs in New York in 2021</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a fair amount of choice in deciding what to spend on the material aspects of a bathroom renovation. Less obvious are the costs that are the backbone and labor of the work overall, no matter what you spend on materials. Knowing what impacts cost during a bathroom renovation will allow you to better align your budget while avoiding surprises. </span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353756989"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to remodel a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">NYC bathroom renovations typically cost between $600 and $850 per square foot, depending on the level of fixtures and materials used. The finish level available from big-box stores like Home Depot and Ikea will put your renovation at the low end of the price range. Custom, hand-made, and imported specialty materials will push you to the high end.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1638353791087"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How much does it cost to retile a bathroom?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Not counting the cost of demolition (removing old tile and grout), count on paying between $3 and $35 per square foot, depending on the type of tile. Basic ceramic tiles will fall on the low end of this range (~$3 PSF). Most stone tiles, and higher-end ceramic tiles will land in the middle of the range (~$15 PSF). Custom and exotic imported tiles can reach or exceed the high end of the range (~$30+ PSF).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary for two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<h3>Garage Conversions / ADUs</h3>

<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular. They are a great way to add valuable square footage to your home and create additional, functional spaces. Sweeten contractors converted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle&#8217;s garage</a> (<em>above</em>) and turned <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime&#8217;s garage</a> into a studio office (<em>below</em>). Each includes bathrooms and kitchenettes.</p>

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>). Rosaire turned her garage into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a> with a pantry (<em>below</em>).</p>

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>). Trim and molding also set a polished look for every room. A &#8217;60s house receives elegant millwork in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovation below.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>While renovating their Brooklyn brownstone, Nazli and Larry discovered the merits of a dark, painted pantry and that heated floors were indeed worth fighting for</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>One kitchen and two bathrooms get a fresh start</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If there&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve learned in seeing thousands of renovations, it&#8217;s not the size of the remodel that matters; it&#8217;s how closely you pay attention to the details. Thoughtful and careful consideration of the materials and finishes used in a space can have a huge impact. Read on for three Sweeten homeowners who took their small spaces to the next level.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Project</strong></strong></span>: Revive a tired bathroom</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Location</strong></strong></span>: Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Before</strong></strong></span>: </span>When the sink cracked in this homeowner’s outdated bathroom, it got her thinking about the rest of the space. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Planning on keeping the plumbing intact, her to-do list included swapping out the tile, wallpaper, vanity, and lighting fixtures, in addition to reglazing the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-white-bathroom-with-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48980 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige and white bathroom with vanity and sink and green wallpaper before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><strong>After</strong></strong>:</span>White subway tile paired with a marble hex floor tile increased the brightness tenfold. A brand new sink (free of cracks) and simple white vanity replace the old set while <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-century modern sconces</a> flank the mirror. This clean and crisp makeover makes it hard for us to believe that we&#8217;re looking at the same bathroom from the &#8220;before&#8221; photos!</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A rip-and-replace opens up a kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Murray Hill, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: </span>This homeowner&#8217;s newly purchased apartment was in great condition but the kitchen needed some work, so he posted his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Aiming to create an open kitchen with clean lines, the focus was placed on knocking down walls, redoing cabinets and countertops, installing new appliances, and replacing the flooring.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>Glossy white upper cabinets are balanced by espresso wood-grain cabinets along the bottom, providing a sharp (and welcome!) contrast to the bland wood tone cabinets from before. Under-cabinet lighting boosts the overall brightness, reflecting off the bright white backsplash and countertops. The muted walls—painted in an almost buttercream shade—and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blonde hardwood floors</a> add just the right amount of warmth.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade an outdated bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Washington Heights, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: This postwar apartment had good bones but was borderline decrepit when the homeowner purchased it. Ready to gut-renovate, she <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and found <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten architect</a>. One of the rooms that needed a complete overhaul was the bathroom. Her plan: combine clean lines and useful storage with touches of vintage modern style (which may sound like an oxymoron but happens to be a real thing—it’s a combo of old-school style meets modern simplicity).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>New fixtures and a <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-wide medicine cabinet</a> bring a much-needed functional upgrade. The slim profile of a pedestal sink takes up little floor space, allowing the opposite wall to take on extra storage in the form of open shelves and a spot for a hamper. A glass shower partition—as opposed to a shower curtain—improves the flow of light and helps make </span>the space<span style="color: #000000;"> feel bigger. White square tiles lend a twist to the classic subway variety.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a master bathroom in Pelham, New York</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In advance of moving into their newly purchased Pelham home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom in Westchester, Alexy and her husband decided to get some necessary renovations out of the way. The couple had a five-year-old and were pregnant with their second child. They were still living in Brooklyn, which made this reno project one that would be done from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house only had showers, which aren’t ideal for bathing infants. They decided to add a tub to the second-floor bathroom, which had already undergone a renovation by the previous owner that had stolen some space from the neighboring bedroom. “The bedroom closet was just a few inches deep with some shelves,” Alexy said. There was also the absence of a linen closet on the second floor. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Alexy was familiar with Sweeten from the service&#8217;s many renovations in Brooklyn, but didn&#8217;t know any general contractors in Westchester. She needed to find one she could trust since the house would be empty. They tried to get to Pelham on weekends to check on the work even though Alexy was nine months pregnant.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor they chose</a> took space from the hallway to add a large linen closet to the bathroom. &#8220;It holds a lot, and that is exactly what I wanted,” said Alexy. The redistributed hallway space also provided the extra room needed to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> to the shower area. Alexy’s husband originally wanted a double vanity, but there just wasn’t enough room. After much soul-searching, he decided what he really wanted was adequate counter space. The vanity they went with had a counter that stretched to the wall while adding more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> underneath.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The project was finished pretty much on time except for the vanity, which took a long time to be delivered, but their Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget and they encountered no surprises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elevating privacy with an extra WC</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your home only has one bathroom, then you’ve probably fantasized about moving to a bigger place just to get a second one. Maybe you don’t have to move to accomplish your goal! These five Sweeten homeowners repurposed existing square footage in their homes—adjusting layouts and converting closets, alcoves, and unused rooms—in order to add another bathroom. Whether it&#8217;s a powder room, master or guest bath, home just got a little more comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30122 size-chrono" title="guest bath" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30154 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it easier to accommodate guests in their home in Riverhead, NY, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/bathroom-renovation-country-home-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate and Michelle</a> added an ensuite bath to their second bedroom. “Our main question was really just how difficult would it be to add a bathroom where one hadn’t existed before,” said Nate. The couple found the perfect location: an alcove that was located next to the guest bedroom and right above the downstairs bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27390 mb-0 size-chrono" title="powder room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it came time to update the rental-grade bathroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s condo</a>, she decided to add a powder room as well. The 1,500-square-foot apartment had plenty of room for guests and potential for a third bedroom in the future, but only one bathroom. The new addition brings a whole new level of comfort to the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32953 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32954 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than renovating the existing upstairs bath in her Brooklyn brownstone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith</a> started from scratch and ripped out the second-floor kitchen. She transformed the space into a closet and master bathroom with a huge shower. “The new shower is about the size of the studio I lived in during grad school,” said Meredith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30627 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30626 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt18-723x482.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with their Sweeten general contractor, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-creative-home-to-call-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimee and B</a> came up with a plan to add a second bathroom to their 3-bed, 1-bath apartment. Reconfiguring the layout mean taking down a wall between two of the bedrooms so that the master bedroom lined up next to a large walk-in closet. That spot became the master bath and a new closet was built for the couple’s clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32118 mb-0 size-chrono" title="guest bath" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-BrettArpel-Apt20-723x1085.jpg" alt="adding a bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terri and Brett&#8217;s</a> primary objective during their renovation was to add a second bathroom as a guest bath, which they achieved by relocating the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets. “Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private,” Brett said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Connecticut couple refreshes their first townhouse</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2016, Brooklyn homeowner Lauren embarked on her first Sweeten renovation. The result: a beautiful <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alcove studio</a> that was featured in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times story</a> on organizing small spaces. In 2017, she moved to Connecticut to join her fiancé and upgraded to a 3,000-square-foot condo in Stamford. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Space was no longer an issue, but the home appeared to be stuck in the early ‘80s. There was also a suspiciously damp smell from the accumulation of several leaks during the previous owners&#8217; time there. Given her positive past experience with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, Lauren returned to post her latest project to find the best contracting team. (Luckily, Sweeten had recently expanded its free service, matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, to Fairfield County.) Read on for her take on renovating with Sweeten outside of New York City!</em></p>

Guest post by Stamford homeowner Lauren</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is now my second Sweeten renovation and my first time renovating with my fiancé, Austin. After remodeling my Brooklyn Heights co-op, I ended up moving to Stamford, Connecticut, the following year and started looking for a condo to buy with Austin. The search didn’t take long and we found a 3-bed, 2.5-bath townhouse that was in need of some updating before we moved in. The unit had lots of potential, but it was dated and hadn’t really been touched since it was first built over 30 years ago: orange oak kitchen cabinets, vinyl flooring, wall-to-wall carpeting, mirrored walls—you get the idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32537 size-chrono" title="happy-couple-in-renovated-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31-723x483.jpg" alt="happy couple in their renovated kitchen" width="723" height="483" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-31.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32538 mb-0 size-chrono" title="single-tree-near-red-brick-condo" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32-723x1083.jpg" alt="single tree near a red brick condo" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-32.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we had a vision for the space, and given how smoothly my first renovation experience had gone, it was only natural that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25822#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we turned to Sweeten</a> again to help us find our contractor. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor we chose</a> was incredibly organized, professional, and had a very detailed quote, which we appreciated. Some contractors struck us as too hopeful with regard to project scope, while others were “doom-and-gloom” purveyors, finding calamity behind every piece of drywall. Our contractor tempered our enthusiasm by identifying challenges we didn’t see coming but never told us something couldn’t be done. He was attentive and imaginative.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I was leaving my recently renovated apartment to start our life together in Stamford, we needed to bring some of the modern city elements to the suburbs. One of the challenges was the large amount of space to be updated without having a huge budget. Since we had plans to grow into the space over time, we decided to focus on the areas we’d use the most—the first two floors and the master bathroom. We wanted the unit to feel current with our own choices but without ripping everything out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I worked really well together and collaborated on elements that were important to us. He pushed for the recessed lighting in the kitchen and dining room, whereas I was excited about the engineered floor and spent weeks reviewing my selection. Believe it or not, I found the flooring company on a deep-dive on Instagram. There were no local distributors or showrooms, but I was able to track down a salesperson in Texas who helped me select the material remotely. When it arrived, I knew it was the best decision; it really transformed the space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, we knew the wall-to-wall carpet on the first two floors would be replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered hardwood</a>. The kitchen cabinets would be repainted and new appliances added. We increased the kitchen storage and functionality by adding the Simple Human under-sink trash and recycling bins. Roll-out chrome baskets held strainers and cleaning supplies and pot lids sat on racks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding a bill-paying station/drop zone just outside the kitchen made a big difference. It used to be an extra kitchen cabinet. But in order to make the space work for us, I knew we needed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work area</a> that wasn’t the dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we added California Closets to maximize the space. The closets had an odd layout, so a custom system enabled us to design it to fit our needs. The master bath was refreshed with new tile and fixtures.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32569 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-passageway-wooden-floor-bench" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03-723x1083.jpg" alt="white passageway with wooden floor and bench and white door with bronze doorknob after renovation " width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An entryway on the lower level from the garage leads you to our gym. Our Sweeten contractor worked incredibly hard on these stairs after the carpeting was removed. He showed his skills laying down the plank, nosing, and risers, especially with the corners and angles.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32555 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-walls-home-gym" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02-723x489.jpg" alt="white walls in a home gym with equipments and black floor after renovation " width="723" height="489" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02-723x489.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02-300x203.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02-600x406.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-LaurenDeCaro-CondoRefresh-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A home gym/multipurpose room was created on the lower level. Our contractor covered the concrete floor with a specific floor paint as a moisture barrier and then laid down interlocking foam floor tiles. They were more cost-effective and functional than continuing the engineered wood into this space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every renovation has its ups and downs. In this one, we kept discovering water damage! When we bought the condo, it had a musty smell, so we knew we were going to find some sort of water issue, but I don’t think we realized how much. The previous owners just covered up rotten subfloor with new carpeting in multiple places. And when they decided the lower level needed a closet, they just framed it out right on top of the shag! So it proved comical when we tried to remove the old carpet and found ourselves using pliers to get every last bit of remnant out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor and his team worked late into the evenings and on many weekends to keep up with our scheduled move-in date. Unfortunately, our flooring got delayed, and that held him up, but he was proactive and able to work on other projects in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, we learned it will always take longer than you had hoped, but in the end, it’s all worth it. Make all of your design selections in advance of starting construction. You can cut down on costs by taking on some of the work yourself, but there’s a reason why professional contractors stay in business. They quickly finished what would have been gargantuan tasks to amateurs like us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I love our new space. Friends and family come over and are so impressed with the transformation. My second Sweeten renovation went as well as my first, and I think it speaks to the company and the quality contractors that are in the Sweeten network.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Update an inefficient bathroom in Queens</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Kate and her husband, Daniel, had lived in their two-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens, for four years. Redoing the bathroom and kitchen were always on the table, but since Daniel is a food writer who needed to experiment with recipes, he went to Sweeten for the kitchen renovation first. “We didn’t have the funds to do them both at the same time,” explained Daniel. Fast forward a few years and a baby on the way “really forced our hand with the bathroom renovation,” he said. “We are either doing it now or never.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding a bathtub was just the immediate necessity. There was also an issue with the water temperature; the shower would either freeze or scald you. The radiator was installed on a wall above head height, which Daniel thought was odd. (“Doesn’t hot air rise?”  he asked.) The bathroom looked like it had been revamped in the &#8217;70s with plenty of drab beige tiles decorated with floral prints. The couple wanted to bring the lagging aesthetic in-line with the prewar design of the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Daniel-Gritzer-Before2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroo-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49087 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with glass door for walk in shower before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-door-with-handle-beige-wall-tile" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49104 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom door with handle and beige wall tiles and steel towel hanger before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-Before-02-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: One of the most important aspects of the renovation was the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>. They came <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back to Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found their general contractor</a>. “We have this baby coming. Please, please don’t let there be construction going on when we have a baby,” Daniel recalled saying. Their Sweeten contractor understood the tight timeframe and kept the project moving, finishing a month before baby Adrian arrived.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">The radiator dilemma was a key feature that Kate and Daniel’s Sweeten contractor helped to resolve. At one point, there was a complicated plan to rerun the steam pipe so the radiator could be installed on the floor. However, the contractor guided them toward removing the radiator altogether. The risky decision was a winner, with the rest of the apartment generating enough heat to keep the bathroom warm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the water temperature issue was another unknown. The problem could have been in the wall of the bathroom or elsewhere in the building. Thankfully, it turned out to be inside the wall. “Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/shower-heads-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water temperature control</a> is so beautiful, I feel like I am in a hotel,” said Daniel.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the aesthetic, the couple spent a lot of time on <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a>. They went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-popular-bath-tiles-and-how-much-they-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic subway tile</a> for the walls and hexagonal tile in a royal blue colorway for the floor. Salvaged redwood planks along the bathtub added some warmth. The gold fixtures were an effort to mimic the brass found throughout the rest of the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Daniel-Gritzer08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="half-tiled-bathroom-with-gold-fixture" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49094 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-15.jpg" alt="Half tiled bathroom with golden bathroom fittings over white farmhouse sink and vanity mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-with-recessed-shelf" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49095 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="White subway tiles in shower area with bright gold bathroom fittings and recessed shower shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-shower-area-with-subway-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49096 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-14.jpg" alt="White shower area with white subway tiles and bright gold bathroom fittings after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Daniel-Bathroom-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: While on a trip to Puebla, Mexico, a few years ago, the couple bought a box of hand-painted tiles with no real purpose in mind. When Kate and Daniel’s Sweeten contractor proposed a nook in the shower for soap, they were able to incorporate some of the tiles into the design.</p>

Her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531#references" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a> went to work freshening up the space (she redid her kitchen as well; see results <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-pretty-entry-for-a-classic-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). The goal was to modernize the small space with new fixtures and finishes while retaining the original footprint. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t allowed to expand the existing footprint,&#8221; says Deborah, &#8220;because my co-op wouldn&#8217;t allow a &#8216;wet space-over-dry-space&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they went to demo the bathroom, the contractor discovered that the waste lines were all sunk into the floor, rather than the walls, where they are usually found. They had to redo them all, which added an additional week to the project for inspections and approvals and an extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="off-white-bathroom-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49097 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="Off white bathroom with glass door to tub and white vanity with oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A calm color palette provides a serene spot to get ready for the day. White subway tile and a subtle gray paint on the walls are paired with a modern white floating <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with custom pull-out drawers, which provides more accessible and usable space than traditional doors. The vanity, with ample storage, was a suggestion by her contractor and &#8220;meant I didn&#8217;t need a bulky medicine cabinet,&#8221; said Deborah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A metal grille cover was created for the radiator. A combination of white-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelving-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open shelving</a> and a glass shelf above the toilet provide plenty of display space for small toiletries. The Sweeten contractor also came up with the idea to add the paneling on the side of the bathtub for a classic look, as well as framing the window in white Thassos marble molding. Topped off with a frameless shower enclosure, the space is functional and beautiful, a major improvement from its predecessor. &#8220;My contractor was excellent with design,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am thrilled with my new bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Everyone loves a window in the bathroom, and the Sweeten contractor was sure to frame this one with a waterproof application that would keep the space watertight for years to come.</p>

<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors and white walls and radiator coverred under large window with black frames and recessed lights after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors and white walls and radiator coverred under large window with black frames and recessed ceiling lights after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51492" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg" alt="dining with white walls and ceiling girder and hardwood floors and half wall book shelf divider partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51489" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>

<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turning a leaky bathroom into a modern space in Harlem</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The condo Jen and Luke purchased two years ago was in move-in condition. It had everything they needed, including the extras—central air, washer and dryer, dishwasher, ice maker, and garbage disposal. But, as it turned out, it also had a poorly laid-out bathroom that caused them nightmares. They had an interior architect friend who helped with the design, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project on Sweeten</a> to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-marble-bathroom-with-shower-head" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49106 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Gray marble bathroom with shower head and wall fixtures before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a decade, Jen, a senior managing director of a residential real estate firm in Manhattan, and Luke, who works in IT for a women’s fashion and accessory house, had been subletting an apartment. When the owner decided to sell, they searched close to their neighborhood and found a 948-square-foot apartment in an 1892 factory building that had been converted to condos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom was the one dark spot on their otherwise sunny horizon. Apparently, there was a leak in the shower pan, which was causing the light gray marble floor to turn brown, yellow, and pink. “When we purchased the apartment, we didn’t realize that the shower was previously repaired for a leak,” Luke said. “But the repair hadn’t addressed the cause of the leak, which was the shower pan itself. We took this as a sign to renovate our bathroom.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: They contacted their friend and interior architect Irene Kang. “We could not have done this without her help,” Luke said. Kang suggested a minimalist design “with cool colors that maximized the space and had a lot of storage.” As a real estate professional, Jen used her expertise as well. “Bathrooms are personal,” she said. “Sometimes apartments don’t sell due to bathrooms since they are one of the most expensive rooms to renovate.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided to go with neutral colors and plan to hang art to make the space personal. Aside from the shower pan issue, they needed more storage space. Irene suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large cabinets</a> inset into a wall shared with the master bedroom closet. “I knew that there were approximately four to five inches of space on the interior of the drywall,” Luke said. “Knowing this and the depth of the cabinets, I was able to figure out that they would stick out only four to five inches into the bathroom itself, which would not get in the way.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Luke-Miller-Bathroom05.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-black-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49107 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black floor tiles and floating vanity and vanity mirror and shower niche after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="large-storage-wall-insert-cabinet" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49108 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-05.gif" alt="Large storage cabinets inserted into wall with white pocket door after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, they weren’t sure where they could find something that would meet their needs. They found themselves at the Kohler Experience Center in Manhattan. “We described our idea, and Caroline [Hughes, their sales rep] suggested looking at the Robern line of cabinets,&#8221; Luke said. &#8220;We did, and that was it.” Now two cabinets measuring 70” tall x 15” wide and 8” deep sit side by side. “They were expensive, but worth it,” he said. In the end, their Sweeten contractor just had to frame it out and cut out a wall stud. “It was simple,” Luke said. To add to the storage, the contractor created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower niche</a>, while the size of the vanity increased from 36” to 60” wide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="glass-door-for-shower-niche" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49110 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="Glass door for the shower niche with beige wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Luke-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between Irene, the Sweeten contractor, and Caroline, “we had lots of help with design decisions,” Luke said. “We made all of our selections, including tiles and fixtures, in one afternoon.&#8221; Jen adds, &#8220;The prices were reasonable and they can help you get non-Kohler items too. They made it super easy.” Their favorite finds are the medicine cabinet above the sink and the LED mirrors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge was living in their apartment <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the renovation</a>. “We have a one-bedroom, two-bath space and the master bath was undergoing the renovation,” Luke said. “We were subject to mold, mildew, and construction dust, despite the best efforts of the contractor to keep everything clean. He did a superb job of keeping our space livable, but some things you cannot escape unless you have a ventilation system.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor focused on small details too, such as selecting the threshold saddle for the shower and hiding the tile edges with aluminum molding. “He helped with the design and function every step of the way,” said Luke. “Sweeten was in constant contact in case we needed help,&#8221; said Jen. &#8220;Since Luke has project management experience and has worked in furniture factories, we didn’t require the attention that others might. But it was comforting to know they were there when needed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the support is what gave them the bathroom that they envisioned. “You’ve really got to listen to your designers, the store people, and your contractor,” Jen said. “Don’t be afraid to tell people what you want, but if they offer an opinion, listen. The client is always right and they will do what you want, but they know what will look good in years to come.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the uninitiated, renovating seems like a big deal; the many steps involved in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5vllUc10nmIlVIPO_GxH728C6dQ" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgdEIXSUBksdwXwI-X7rESOF0d8Q" rel="noopener">bathroom</a> remodel <wbr />can make even the most excited homeowner hesitate. But a well-executed project can make both a positive impact on your day-to-day life and your home&#8217;s resale value. Plus, you don’t have to face it alone! Below, these first-time renovators took the plunge with Sweeten by their side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32092 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Sophia and Leon" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuh29ImbX28HxWHcMK42a3-pAyMQ" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s</a> newly purchased 3-bedroom unit needed to be gutted, but the couple had concerns about staying on budget&#8230;a gut reno sounded expensive! Their Sweeten general contractor guided the newbie renovators in making budget-friendly decisions, advising on what to keep (appliances that were in working condition) and what to replace (farewell, dated cabinets). Although the prospect of a gut renovation was daunting, Sophia was delighted with the results AND the money they were able to save, and said: “This was a great first-time renovating experience and we’re so happy in our new home!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Christine-Bathroom.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32093 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowner Christine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Christine-Bathroom-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea of buying her first home and remodeling the bathroom felt overwhelming to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a>. But a long search for the right space changed her mind. “No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?” Christine said. She posted her project on Sweeten and was matched with a general contractor whose past work had a similar aesthetic to the look she hoped to achieve: minimalism with a warm and cozy vibe. “My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free.” Her advice to first-time renovators? “Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated space, I promise.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it came time to choose a general contractor for her kitchen renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmu2-VnBrd367LlQU0TW2RVF2m3Q" rel="noopener">Amanda</a> wasn’t sure how to decide between bids. A phone call with her Sweeten client services contact helped her compare bids, considering the pros and cons of each contractor and how they stacked up as a potential fit for her project. The guidance gave Amanda the confidence she needed to make the right decision, getting her renovation off to a great start. Her contractor’s close attention to detail allowed him to quickly resolve issues, enabling them to finish the job within the one-month timeframe. Amanda’s advice to other first-time renovators is simple. “Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Felix-Bathroom.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32095 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowner Felix and her daughter Nova" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Felix-Bathroom-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAS-RzwK1X6t1GDNDI3TKlJeB1aw" rel="noopener">Felix</a> decided to add a powder room to her apartment and renovate the existing bathroom, a Google search led her to Sweeten. New to the idea of renovating, Felix kept changing and updating her project for about a year before she was ready to start her renovation. Her Sweeten general contractor was patient and willing to jump in whenever she needed him. &#8220;That was really why I went with him,&#8221; Felix said. &#8220;He stuck with me through the procrastination!” From that point onward, everything was smooth sailing. In the end, Felix described the overall renovation process as &#8220;surprisingly easy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28970 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_AnneMichealDuncan_Kitchen08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After being stuck in a “contractor no-man’s-land,” receiving bids from handymen whose skills didn’t meet the requirements of the job and contractors who were only interested in larger projects, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-kitchen-basks-in-natural-light/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-kitchen-basks-in-natural-light/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCEnV3PMnvA5pBouGAXmYXZhsADg" rel="noopener">Anne and Michael</a> came to Sweeten. “We posted the project and the budget and got serious responses from contractors specifically interested in a project of our size,” Anne said. &#8220;Our contractor helped us source appliances, counters, and backsplash tile, which we found really helpful as first-timers.&#8221; Their advice: “It’s such a cliche, but it&#8217;s going to take longer than you think.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29851 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-old-bath-gets-investment-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt</a> purchased his first home, a 360-square-foot apartment in Park Slope, in July 2013. Over the next few years, he saved up to renovate the bathroom. “I wanted a complete bathroom renovation not only to feel better about the space, but also as an investment,” he said. Matt found Sweeten and posted his project, working with the client services team to guide his decision-making. He remodeled his bath, creating a clean and refreshed space with plenty of storage. “Because this was my first renovation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful to Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten years ago, Saul and his brother won the lottery. The housing lottery, that is! The prize: a one-bedroom apartment with a terrace in one of New York City’s famed Mitchell-Lama apartments near Manhattan&#8217;s South Street Seaport. (As an affordable housing program started in the mid 20th century, Mitchell-Lama housing ensures that many New Yorkers are able to remain in the city on moderate to middle incomes.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, Saul and his now wife, Kate, lived in the apartment. When the couple left New York, Saul’s brother moved into the apartment with his family. Initially, they didn’t do much to the space, making only cosmetic improvements, updating the carpets, adding some window blinds, and changing out some bath fixtures. Fast forward a decade and the apartment had seen a lot of wear and tear.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Kate and Saul discovered last year that they would be returning to New York for their jobs—Saul works for a political consulting firm and Kate in international development—they realized that a full renovation was in order before they could live in the apartment again. Saul’s brother, who now has two kids, had long outgrown the space. The kitchen cabinets were falling off their hinges, and the carpets and blinds had not aged well. The bathroom also needed a thorough update. The floors and walls needed to be refreshed. They were also thinking ahead to the eventual resale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the period since Saul and his brother obtained the apartment, the building’s residents had voted to privatize the corporation. Existing residents were given the option of putting in some additional funding in order to buy into the now market-rate, privatized co-op building. This meant that homeowners would eventually be able to sell the apartment on the open market, and when they went to do that, it would be important to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovation that could facilitate resale</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With all of this in mind, Kate and Saul <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, at the suggestion of a co-worker after they experienced a false start with another contractor who did not understand how to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navigate co-op board approvals</a>. Kate admits that they were “not at all good at creative endeavors…it’s hard for us to even hang a photo!” So they knew that they needed some guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to work with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, they decided on a clean, subtle palette for the apartment. Kate loves color and pattern and had wanted to incorporate a lot of both, but after talking it through with their contractor, and with resale in mind, she decided that color could be added in less permanent ways. Changing the plumbing locations or adding too much electrical weight to the apartment weren&#8217;t options, given its age and their construction timeline. However, good visual flow from room to room was important, and more than anything, the couple wanted a simple, comfortable space for friends and family to hang out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31310 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath-Before7-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31344 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31313 mb-0 size-chrono" title="wood-vinyl-floor-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath13.gif" alt="natural wood vinyl floor with white kitchen cabinets and knobs and silver oven after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As they began, a few hiccups slowed their progress. The building&#8217;s strict requirements meant jumping through multiple hoops for approval, which took months, but their contractor was key in getting them through this process. Next, as they embarked on demolition, workers uncovered asbestos in the floor tiles of the living room, which then had to undergo a full remediation that took two months. The Sweeten contractor addressed these issues as quickly as possible and got them back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31314 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath02-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31343 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath07-1-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation, Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31316 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-gray-knob" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath12.gif" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray knob and silver appliance along with gray backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2017, the couple moved back to New York and into the apartment. The renovation was not quite done: they didn’t have a door on the bathroom and the kitchen was not yet finished. Their only working sink was in the bathroom. But the contractor worked to complete the kitchen 10 days after they moved back in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wait was well worth it: Kate loves the look of the custom cabinets and was thrilled with the useful storage solutions. They not only have a built-in silverware drawer, but also a corner Lazy Susan and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out spice rack</a>! The contractor made some minor adjustments to the footprint of the kitchen, removing an old broom closet opposite the refrigerator to make room for a new dishwasher. The other appliances, swapped out for new models, remained in the same spots as their predecessors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, a gray vanity is set against white subway tile with black accent tiles and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned floor</a>. The look is simple but very New York, befitting a downtown apartment. In the rest of the apartment, a light-colored hardwood replaced gray carpeting and subtle colors provide a calming backdrop for an escape from the city streets. All of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a> received makeovers, courtesy of the Sweeten contractor’s father, who happened to be a millworker and walked through the apartment with Kate to sketch out her vision of how the closets could be made more practical. Last but not least, they removed the popcorn ceiling and applied three coats of skim coating and painting. The walls also received basic sanding prior to painting. “The ceiling was really a miraculous transformation,” Kate reports. “It totally changed the look of the apartment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking back on the process, Kate shares that she had no experience with design and no background in home improvement, so she was not at all prepared for the work and time it required on a daily basis. She also realized that, as a homeowner, you need to be prepared to explain exactly what you want so that the contractor and his team can execute it: “They aren’t mind-readers!” She met with them each day during the construction to discuss options and make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the interior of the apartment is done, they are ready to turn their attention to their coveted outdoor terrace in the city! When that time comes, Sweeten is ready to help them &#8220;sweeten&#8221; their outdoors, too.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Choosing tile for your bathroom floor and walls is the fun part for many. Often a particular tile is spotted and is a &#8220;must-have&#8221; and the space is designed around it. The tile becomes the focal point. Other times a fixture style or a certain color palette is leading the design. In this case, the tile would be chosen as a supporting—but important—background role. In terms of price, the bathroom tile costs for a remodel will range depending on colorway, material, shape, pattern, and finish.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve rounded up popular looks to guide your search and the prices you can expect to pay. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractor</a> will hire the right subcontractor depending on the type of tile being installed. </p>

<p>If you’re looking to showcase a single feature in the bathroom, consider the herringbone pattern. Sweeten homeowners Mitzie and Jenifer laid down their floor with cement tile in Federal Blue. Katherine and Gus set matte black fixtures against a pale green ceramic tile on the backsplash and shower wall.</p>
<h4>Cost for herringbone tile styles</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Herringbone bathroom tile costs start around $3 per piece and can go up to $17 per piece. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Jill’s bath, a bold black hexagon floor tile balances a long double-sink vanity. The tile can also exhibit a softer side in a neutral color as seen on Erica&#8217;s shower wall. Check out her creative backsplash design idea. Lia and Chris&#8217; smaller scale on the floor can resemble a mosaic. The smaller the tile, the more grout is used, helping with the grip on the floor so it&#8217;s less slippery.  </p>
<h4>Cost for hexagon tile styles</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Porcelain hexagon bathroom tile costs start at around $10 per square foot; marble begins at around $15 per square foot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten homeowners Nikki and Chris aimed for a prewar look. Iconic of old New York, white subway tile lined the shower and halfway up the bathroom walls. The white tile was the right background for their decorative black-and-gold pineapple wallpaper. </p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost of subway tile</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Standard ceramic subway tile costs around $2 – $3 per square foot. The cost increases with marble around $6 – $9 per square foot.</p>

<p>A longer subway tile has been growing in popularity. It has just enough variation to give off a contemporary vibe. Sweeten homeowner Katy&#8217;s master bathroom mixes a glossy subway tile with a patterned hex in black and white. Steve and Lewis went with a tumbled, handmade slimmer variation in cerulean blue for a small niche half bathroom.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost of elongated subway tile</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an elegant variation on the subway tile, a 3&#8243; x 12&#8243; tile in polished ceramic spans a price range between $4 – $16 per square foot.</p>
<h3><b>Penny tile</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. It works as floor tile in Alicia and Ed’s retro-inspired bath and transforms into a waterfall mosaic in Rachel and Michael’s shower.</p>
<h4>Cost for penny tile</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This kind of bathroom tile can range from $2 per square foot for porcelain to $10 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3><b>Basketweave tile</b></h3>

It feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom. A variety of tile patterns coexist in Cory and Andrew&#8217;s bathroom. For the couple, the basketweave design complemented the penny tile and herringbone shapes. </p>
<h4>Cost for basketweave tile</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom tile costs for lower-end options, like porcelain, cost around $4 per square foot. Expect high-quality marble to begin at $15 per square foot.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A Brooklyn remodel adds bathroom storage &amp; square footage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Sari, a post producer for television commercials, bought a one-bedroom condo in a 45-unit building in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights neighborhood four years ago. She loved the location and feel of the apartment as soon as she walked inside. There were plenty of closets and storage spaces, she said, but “it was mind-blowing to me that there was no storage at all in the bathrooms. &#8220;Who designs a bathroom with no storage space? Crazy, right?” And despite it being built in the aughts (in 2006), the floor tiles and lighting were tired and the large entry door took up a lot of wall real estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-pedestal-sink-near-toilet"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49114 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White pedestal sink near toilet and large vanity mirror in a brown tiled bathroom before and during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Sari envisioned changing the whole layout, expanding the bathroom into her walk-in closet and creating a clean, modern monochromatic space. “I had no idea of how to start,” she said. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. She learned that she wasn’t going to be able to relocate the toilet, so she decided to just keep the original layout and focus on creating a “beautiful and functional space” with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lots of storage</a> in the form of a two-drawer vanity, vanity mirror, and open shelving. The most exciting change? “Radiant floors, which are heaven,” she said.</p>

<p>Sari loves to watch “Fixer Upper” and other home renovation shows. That’s where she got the idea of a pocket door “so I could use the wall space that had been covered up by the original bathroom door.” It&#8217;s a perfect place for a towel bar and hooks. “It makes the room feel much larger,” she said, “especially because the door is rarely closed,” since she lives alone with her pitbull Bruno.</p>
<p>Once the work began, Sari’s Sweeten contractor gutted the bathroom and found leaks coming from neighbors’ apartments above and next door. “That wasn’t fun and a bit stressful,” she said, “but building management fixed them, so we only lost one day during the renovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="vanity-drawers-under-white-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49118 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sari-Bathroom-14.gif" alt="Vanity drawers under white sink and black floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge was finding the tiles. “It was overwhelming and took me over a month,” said Sari, who originally wanted to do a black and white bathroom, but then decided to keep the color scheme in line with the apartment in case this is the only renovation she does. “I had no idea where to go or how to start, but my contractor was very helpful.” He told her where to purchase tile and granite, as well as wood for shelving. Then he picked up everything for her since, she said, “I’m a New Yorker and don’t have a car!” She also found it helpful to contact Sweeten’s client services, which answered her questions and directed her to their partner Build.com, where she purchased most of her fixtures. (“My sales representative there was terrific,” Sari said.)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: With her first remodeling project behind her, she has a few tips for those starting a bathroom remodel: make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. (Also, make sure you know which side of the toilet you want your flusher to be located, because you can’t change that!)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add a shower and update a half-bath/laundry room in Manhattan’s Financial District</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Back in 1996, Elizabeth purchased a loft in a circa 1908 building in the Financial District. She gutted and renovated the 3-bedroom, 1.5-bathroom apartment except for the half-bath, which included a full-size washer and dryer. The layout worked well enough, but eventually, Elizabeth wanted the half-bath upgraded and updated to a full bath/utility room that included shelving and cabinetry—and the décor needed to flow seamlessly with that of the nearby kitchen. The trickiest part was figuring out how to fit everything she wanted into this room. She did the demo herself, and partway through, with design ideas in mind, Elizabeth <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects renovators with vetted general contractors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth’s Sweeten contractor discovered</a> a space behind a wall—about a linear foot and a half—making it possible to have a larger shower base and sink. Yay! They also found space by stacking the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a>. And while she was worried that all the bits and pieces would fit in the room, her contractor was able to build lots of custom details like slide-out shelves and cabinetry for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> so the room would be functional yet not overcrowded. She was especially pleased with the “beautiful job he did on the floor and with the matching Cambria surfaces.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its familiar broken zigzag is something you’ve probably seen before in a tweed suit or jacket, calling to mind the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Chanel. From fashion to home design, this elegant pattern—expressed in a range of materials—makes a big impact. Below, eight homeowners make herringbone their own.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A peek of oak herringbone underneath old carpeting inspired <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/prewar-apartment-estate-sale-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kasey</a> to restore the original floors in his prewar apartment. During his renovation, he discovered that the floors were in near perfect condition. A light <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touch-up</a> was all that was needed to return them to their former glory.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-43.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry</a> splurged on herringbone <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walnut floors</a> in the kitchen and downstairs parlor, which quickly became one of their favorite features in the townhouse. The pattern, combined with the warmth of the stain, adds plenty of interest and texture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30403 size-chrono" title="herringbone floors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-new-2-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Looking for something more durable than wood, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito</a> chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porcelain tile</a> with imitation grain to give the appearance of polished white oak. Their contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern to punch up the muted tones of the kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30397 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-new-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wanting some &#8220;wow&#8221; in the kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed</a> decided that subway tile was firmly off limits. Instead, the couple chose cream-colored marble laid in a herringbone pattern for a touch of warmth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30398 size-chrono" title="herringbone backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-03-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To inject some color into his all-white kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/home-improves-view-inside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gall</a> chose a gold-toned herringbone backsplash comprised of glass and marble tile. The combination of different materials and colors provides a refreshing update on a classic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24172 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-723x1083.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren and Ross</a> covered every inch of their master bath in marble. For the floor, they chose a white herringbone tile and paired it with fine lines of gray grout for some subtle contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27183 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-19-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ana and Leo</a> amped up the drama in their modern guest bathroom with herringbone mosaic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile</a> in shades of gray. The addition is the perfect complement to the minimal design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24332 mb-0 size-chrono" title="herringbone tile in the shower" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jonathan_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="herringbone" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an all-white theme in mind, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cecilia and Jonathan</a> wanted to keep things bright and shiny in their full bath. A slight deviation from the plan inspired an accent wall of veined marble subway tile laid in a herringbone pattern.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Redesign the first-floor bath in Riverhead, NY</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Brooklyn couple Nate and Michelle bought their 2,010-square-foot-house in Riverhead, NY, as a rural getaway. The home was perfect in many ways, but the bathrooms left a lot to be desired. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/bathroom-renovation-country-home-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building an ensuite bath</a> for the upstairs guest bedroom with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, the couple’s attention turned to the downstairs bath. The plan was to design a bathroom that fit with the farmhouse style of the home while having its own, distinct personality. Nate <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="floral-orange-shower-curtain-with-orange-floor-tile" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49132" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Floral orange shower curtain with orange floor tile and white toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-Before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>While the upstairs bath was being built above the one below, the rooms were not perfectly aligned&#8230;the contractor had to figure out the best way to run pipes.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: First thing to go? The outdated pink floor. Inspired by a photo online of a bathroom with blue walls and a white pedestal sink, Nate and Michelle made it their color scheme. To make it their own, they chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with plenty of storage and added brass fixtures and hardware for tonal contrast. The combo of moody blue, warm brass, and bright white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subway tile</a> makes the space feel fresh and modern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="blue-bathroom-with-glass-doors" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49133 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="Blue bathroom with glass doors for walk in shower with white subway tiles and gray grouting after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the renovation, one bathroom was being built above the other, and the rooms were not perfectly aligned. The contractor had to figure out the best way to run pipes from the downstairs space to the new bathroom upstairs. “The solution was to create a tray ceiling [in the downstairs bath] so the pipes could be concealed around the perimeter of the wall,” Nate said. “Even though the pipes are only along one wall, the tray ceiling makes it look like a nice design decision rather than an extra shape on one side built to hide something.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="blue-bathroom-with-white-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49135 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-14.gif" alt="Blue bathroom with white sink and vanity and black vanity mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His advice for future renovators? “Make sure you have all the pieces before starting. That includes the tile, fixtures, vanities, toilets, and even the little things like towel hooks and toilet paper holders. That way, your project isn’t held up while waiting for some piece to come in.” A smart suggestion for keeping the project on time and running smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-sink-with-golden-bathroom-fixtures" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49136 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="White bathroom sink with golden bathroom fixtures in a blue bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Nate modified a set of store-bought <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelving-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shelves</a> to better suit the space. “The brass shelf is from CB2. It actually comes as a set of three in different sizes designed to hang together,&#8221; he said. “We only wanted one, but the whole set was cheaper than most of the other single brass shelves we found, so we got it anyway. Maybe we’ll find a spot for the other two.”<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30365 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>It was brimming with potential: a corner, prewar loft on a main street in Greenwich Village. The apartment took full advantage of its southern and western exposures with oversized, industrial windows that wrapped around two sides of the loft. Much of the space was open-plan with 14-foot-high ceilings; a mezzanine above the kitchen is accessible via a charming spiral staircase and can be used as a guest bedroom or home office.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30366 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30417 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft21-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>The homeowner saw an opportunity to add value to the apartment by taking advantage of its structural beauty and abundant natural light. The building was converted in the late &#8217;70s from an industrial manufacturing space into residences and the unit had been relatively untouched since. Parquet wood tiles and warped cork would be replaced, and the decades-old kitchen and bath desperately needed a makeover. A few tweaks to the layout would also maximize the space to its full potential as an investment and a primary residence. He decided to go for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30368 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft11-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30406 mb-0 size-chrono" title="loft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft15-1-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing the co-op apartment, the homeowner lived in it for six months before renovating. Modern finishes would be a more suitable backdrop to the gorgeous natural light that poured through the six oversized 10-foot windows. He also decided to use pocket and barn doors for a seamless look and flexible use of spaces. Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. The homeowner <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> and was matched with a Sweeten design-build firm, and they got to work to fulfill the vision.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30370 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30373 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they ripped out the kitchen’s outdated Formica counters and &#8217;70s-era cabinets, and completely gutted the old bathroom. The kitchen ceiling was cut away from the windows by about 18 inches to make more of the windows visible. An entryway closet was reduced so that the view from the kitchen window could be seen from the entrance of the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The floor on the mezzanine was also pulled back from the window and outfitted with a railing along its edge. The hardwood was repainted; the ceiling was scraped and painted, setting the stage for a guest bedroom, office, and additional closet storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30371 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft02-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30372 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft04-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s standout feature is the Carrara marble backsplash and 2-inch-thick countertops with a waterfall edge. Ikea cabinets with blue-gray fronts offset the white marble and are adorned with simple hardware in a satin nickel finish. On the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> side of the kitchen’s U-shaped counters, refrigerator and freezer drawers are tucked discreetly underneath to reduce visual clutter and maximize space efficiency. A stainless steel undermount sink is matched to an industrial faucet and sprayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the side of the peninsula that faces the living room, the ledge of the counter was extended to create a space for bar seating with built-in 12-bottle wine storage as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30426 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft09-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30375 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft08-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30377 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft10-723x482.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the homeowner chose to continue the marble theme with herringbone floors, a warm subway tile on the walls, and the same 2-inch-thick Carrara marble from the kitchen as a counter. With a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frameless glass divider</a>, the deep soaking tub does double duty for baths and showers. Three well-placed niches, including one inside the tub area, add storage for toiletries and small décor objects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30378 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft_Before04-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30382 mb-0 size-chrono" title="guest room and office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft01-723x1085.jpg" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom, which benefits from one of the apartment’s enormous west-facing windows, was slightly reconfigured. The previous owners had installed floor-to-ceiling shelving with a library ladder, which was a good concept but needed to be scaled back. In its place, the Sweeten contractor built open shelving across the length of the room, keeping it within the overhead space so that it didn&#8217;t narrow the feel of the room. When its sliding doors are open, the space feeds into the living room for an open feeling. When the doors are closed, however, there is total privacy in the bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30380 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dressing room and closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft19.gif" alt="loft renovator New York" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closet</a>, which was initially small and located inside the room, was relocated into a newly-created walk-in dressing room between the bedroom and bathroom. The homeowner wanted a closet with plenty of space on three walls for clothing and accessories. The design is perfect for couples, allowing one person to sleep peacefully while the other is getting ready for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, the outdated flooring was replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural white oak</a> in 7-inch-wide planks. Sourced from Vermont, the new floorboards—long rift and quarter-sawn—show a &#8220;tigering&#8221; striped effect and are perfectly suited to the space, making a stylish first impression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mixing luxurious touches with economic ones, the Sweeten team was able to achieve the modern and fresh aesthetic that the homeowner imagined. What did he learn from his renovation experience? “Hire the right contractor and stay very close to the project. I feel like I made every micro decision, but it worked out! The unit looks great and I am a happy customer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Downscaling translates into a more functional apartment</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30234 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For 18 years, home for JoAnn and Brian was a 6-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot Colonial in Chesterfield, New Jersey. As they neared retirement, however, they decided that they wanted to move to Manhattan—a lifelong desire. Their daughter was living in New York City, and the couple already owned an investment property in the Turtle Bay neighborhood that could be converted to their primary residence. The apartment, a one-bedroom co-op measuring 600 square feet, had been rented out for over a decade.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30237 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store_Before07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30236 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bath and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store10-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was tired and worn, and “totally not my style,” says JoAnn. “The kitchen was completely outdated and ugly. I like to cook and wanted more storage and a larger work area. I needed room for all my appliances and a large countertop for prepping. We didn’t add more appliances, though, just bought new and better-quality ones.” The kitchen was walled off from the living area and the entryway with narrowly-arched pass-throughs, which made the space feel smaller than it actually was. The plan for the bathroom, which required a refresh, was to swap out the tub for a large walk-in shower. Storage was to be incorporated throughout the home wherever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30240 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store18-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30241" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store20" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As experienced renovators (with four renovations under their belts!), JoAnn and Brian knew it would be beneficial to hire a licensed contractor who was experienced with local rules and regulations. Since their contacts were all in New Jersey, they were at a loss for where to turn. Then, one day while they were watching the Sunday morning news, they saw a commercial for <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. “We immediately <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filled out the easy online form</a> and were matched with three different contractors. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After meeting our Sweeten contractor</a>, we knew right away we wanted to work with him. This turned out to be our best decision!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo got to work on a design with their contractor that would allow them to downsize comfortably from a six-bedroom house to a one-bedroom apartment (no easy feat). Their biggest concern was storage. Their Sweeten contractor <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redesigned the existing closets</a> to maximize usable area and even found a place to add a new closet in the hallway adjacent to the master bedroom. To keep the apartment “simple, so it doesn’t feel too crowded,” says JoAnn, the kitchen counter stools swivel toward the living room and act as additional seating. A pull-out sofa in the living room does double duty for overnight guests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, their Sweeten contractor took all of JoAnn and Brian’s ideas and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a space</a> with the prep surfaces they needed, while also housing their cooking tools. They chose to leave the footprint as it was, changing out everything else. Rental-grade cabinetry was replaced with custom Shaker-style cabinetry in two tones.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30243" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store02" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along the back wall, which holds the new Bertazzoni stove, Bosch dishwasher, and Liebherr refrigerator, the cabinetry is floor-to-ceiling white. The peninsula sports a dark wood for contrast. Both sides are topped with white Caesarstone counters. Glass subway tile backsplash and a larger-format gray tile on the floors complete the look.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bath, out went the old tub. In its place, their Sweeten contractor installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a> divided from the rest of the bath with a piece of frameless glass for a more open feel. Gray mosaic tiles in complementary shapes—a hex in the shower and a weave in the rest of the room—were chosen for floors. White subway tile on the walls kept things simple, and a modern vanity provided much-needed storage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30246 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store14" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30249" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store15" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next to the vanity, the contractor found room behind the wall, so he opened it up to add floor-to-ceiling built-in shelving, which JoAnn and Brian use for toiletries and small decorative objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom and living room were overhauled with new paint and doors. Yet another archway leading from the bedroom area to the living room was removed for more airiness overhead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30250" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19.gif" alt="SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store19" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They reported a seamless experience working with their Sweeten contractor: “We sent him many pictures of what we liked and he really paid attention,&#8221; said JoAnn. &#8220;We are extremely happy with all the choices. Their work ethic was exemplary. They showed up on time and made themselves available when we needed them. They were conscious of our budget. The contractor and his team were very respectful to our neighbors so as not to disturb anyone. They kept everything neat and orderly. Our apartment was completed in a timely fashion and exceeded our expectations!”</p>
