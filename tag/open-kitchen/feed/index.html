			<h2>4 ways to renovate for an entertainment kitchen that&#8217;ll help gatherings go smoothly</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you love to entertain, you&#8217;ll look at your living spaces for optimal flow and comfort. Whether<span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting together a gathering, large or small, and in any season, your space needs to be functional and efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the kitchen is the main hub for entertaining, a few changes can get your space soiree-ready. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at recent Sweeten kitchen renovations that keep homeowners entertainment-ready. Organized pantries, a peninsula or island for workspace, or removing walls so that everyone is brought in on the action are just a few ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>Parties are made possible by pantries</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any chef will tell you, you should always keep some basic culinary staples in the house. Even a simple stash allows you to throw together a last-minute dinner party. But storing these must-have ingredients (think stocks, spices, and starches) means freeing up space in your kitchen. That’s where a well-designed pantry comes in! These pantries are also clutch even if you have a longer time to plan a party, since they can be used to store your serving dishes and other accouterments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50510 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg" alt="gray kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white countertop and large pantry shelf after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28098-Nilda-Kitchen-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case for Sweeten homeowners </span> Nilda and Brian <span style="font-weight: 400;">. They chose shallower cabinets but a wider pantry unit. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t lose anything in the back and can save the money by not adding the mechanical pullouts you would need for deep pantries,” says Nilda.</span></p>
<h3>Open-concept equals open house</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a large space to host is a homeowner&#8217;s dream. However, many spaces don’t start out open and airy, especially if your home or apartment is older. But by taking down a wall or even just part of it, you can make your kitchen more inviting and comfortable for guests when entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45624 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of an open concept kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montclair, New Jersey, couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) turned to Sweeten to help turn their “old” kitchen into a more livable space—with room for entertaining. They tore down two walls, including the wall between the dining room and kitchen to create an open concept. Plus, they also found enough space for an island counter—a double win for entertaining! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="large-window-in-dining" class="alignnone wp-image-41291 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="large window in the dining area and kitchen island with pendant lights and picture frame molding on walls and tile flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jennifer-Fernandez-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/edgewater-new-jersey-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer and Joe’s New Jersey kitchen renovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Sweeten also included a redesign of their kitchen layout. They asked their </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contractor to knock down a wall to get better sightlines to the wall of windows in their living room. Unfortunately, the entire wall could not be removed as it was load-bearing. So their contractor took down as much of the wall as possible but was still able to make a space that is great for entertaining.</span></p>
<h3>Kitchen islands provide staging space</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating a center island in kitchen design has long been popular, and for good reason! Kitchen islands provide a large meal prep area, as well as space for guests to gather around. Kitchen islands are great for storage, too. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowner and frequent party host, Dawn,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a center island in her recent kitchen remodel for exactly these reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="Image of a large peninsula in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner,” says Dawn (<em>above</em>). “With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-large-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-50484 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg" alt="white kitchen island in a large kitchen with white cabinets and light brown over head cabinets after renovation" width="2500" height="1667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1.jpg 2500w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9.11.2020_IleneBerkson-0232-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/west-village-nyc-condo-renovation-nyc-enters-new-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil and Ilene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also wanted a kitchen island included in their Sweeten renovation plans. It was important to “make smarter use of the space…and be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3>Get the appropriate appliances</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48923 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg" alt="Image of a small entertainment kitchen" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kayla-Apartment-01-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When renovating, you have to divide your must-have vs. your nice-to-have design elements. And, if you love entertaining, you know it’s all about the food. Even though their kitchen was only 70-square-feet, Sweeten homeowners and avid cooks </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/one-bedroom-renovation-chelsea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla and Jesse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (<em>above</em>) made it their focus to include full-size appliances. That meant a 30-inch stove, a large refrigerator,<em> and</em> a dishwasher. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge),” says Kayla. With their new entertainment kitchen, the couple can create their favorite dishes for friends and family more easily.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44787 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Image of a chef-friendly galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel and Kate,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also avid cooks, wanted a chef-friendly redesign for their galley kitchen. But unlike a lot of homeowners, they wanted to keep the layout. Daniel considers the galley configuration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a residential approximation of a commercial restaurant line. Rather than lamenting its limits, he saw it as a pro’s set-up. Wherever you’re standing, everything is within reach!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mind—light, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great light in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desired larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if you’ve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Here’s the story of how a visit with friends led them to a new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amanda’s initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters for out-of-town visitors.  At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had been in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as there were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager for a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into it—after all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasn’t sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweeten’s project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amanda’s vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wanted for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. “We both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,” Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check out Laura and Matthew’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joe’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooring—a wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A single set of glass doors was installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of drama—they had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surface requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she “adores them!” Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they kept their fairly new appliances from the apartment’s previous renovation, they added a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that we’ve ever heard—about two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that they’re done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: “Don’t rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didn’t cut corners and finished on schedule—it took about a month in the end. Although this didn’t happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22343 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22339 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amanda’s one regret is that they didn’t think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A contemporary kitchen update in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: To refresh this open 100-square-foot kitchen, the homeowner chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> who would make some key changes, including replacing harsh gloss black counters, which showed dirt. She wanted a new sink, a pale marble backsplash, and a stainless range hood to punch up minimalist replacement cabinets.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span><span class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-s2">: Nothing juices property values like natural light. A once-blocked window jumped back into full view when frosted glass-front cabinets came down from in front, thus brightening new open shelving installed against the adjacent wall. Existing wood-finish base cabinets got swapped for efficient white Swedish cabinetry from IKEA, upgraded with a Lazy Susan in the corner and lighting inside.</span></p>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-s2">Centered in the new matte gray stone peninsula countertop is a sleek stainless undermount sink, with a single-hole, deck-mount lever faucet and separate built-in soap dispenser. The existing stainless stove was reinstalled beneath large-format marble tiles used for the backsplash, themselves crowned by a compact stainless range hood with additional much-needed closed storage above.</span></p>
<p class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-p1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span><span class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-s2">:Extending happy sky-blue wall paint up onto the lower kitchen ceiling subtly differentiates it from the open-plan living room, where the ceiling stayed white.</span></p>
<p class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-p1" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span><span class="m_1763142489777351498gmail-s2">: IKEA kitchen cabinets, an undermount stainless sink, matte dark gray countertops that hide dirt, marble backsplash tiles.</span></p>

			<h2>Want to cut down on prep steps? Need more space for guests? These Thanksgiving-ready kitchens by Sweeten do it all.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49065 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Thanksgiving is a time people look forward to seeing friends and family and being thankful. But those things aside, big gatherings can be stressful on homeowners. The biggest challenge is kitchen organization; cooking and prepping food, along with needing space to serve. The right kitchen features can help ease the frustrations caused by clutter. Sweeten has helped homeowners design Thanksgiving-ready kitchens to ease the holiday strain. We selected these specific kitchens for their unique characteristics that will make any get-together easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sweeten</span></a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Roomy kitchen countertops produce Thanksgiving meals with ease</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg" alt="chef in his kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-42806 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">With friends and family gathering, Thanksgiving calls for generous kitchen counters. Yet, many kitchens lack the counter space it takes to host. Adding more work surface area creates more room and less clutter. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">As a chef, </a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">Arnish</a> </span>decided that a huge kitchen peninsula would solve many of his troubles. “Sometimes we have up to 80 people in the space.” Their renovation also included a wine fridge, which makes for less traffic in the kitchen when cooking and preparing.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>With large food prep, cooking, or spreading out platters, a considerable surface space is a must.</p>
<h3><strong>A small kitchen island comes with big advantages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" class="alignnone wp-image-24678 size-full" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Small spaces can hold untapped potential. When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula remodeled her kitchen with Sweeten</a>, she added a small kitchen island. The &#8220;dresser-style&#8221; island is a storage workhorse, providing three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and pots and pans. It&#8217;s ideal for food-forward holidays and dinner parties since it doubles as a serving station.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><strong>A deep and wide sink helps with dreaded dinner cleanup</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" title="white-countertop-with-farmhouse-sink"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen with white overhead cabinets and white countertop with farmhouse sink and backsplash with white subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-39860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">For dishes that can’t fit in the dishwasher and squeeze into a regular basin, deep and wide sinks don’t disappoint. Brooklyn brownstone owners <span>Christina and </span>Aaron, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/brownstone-kitchen-renovation-prospect-lefferts-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who renovated their kitchen with Sweeten</a>, chose a large volume farmhouse sink. The uniquely deep design is great for soaking extra-sticky dishes and accommodating baking trays or sauté pans.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Pass-throughs become conversation stations</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="all-white-kitchen-pass-through-window"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with stainless steel appliances and flush mounted ceiling light and pass through window bar with white countertop and white walls after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone wp-image-50990 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Adding barstools to the kitchen island makes conversation during Thanksgiving more enjoyable. Guests eager to lend a helping hand can prepare food and chat with the host without being in the way. In this Sweeten kitchen renovation, homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-living-room-renovation-puts-a-pool-table-in-the-spotlight/">Dan found having barstools</a> at the pass-through offered seating and a more open feel to the space.</p>
<h3><strong>Built-in pot fillers let you work smarter, not harder during Thanksgiving</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" style="color: #333333;" /></span></a>Installing a pot-filler above the stove eliminates a step from cooking. Romauld, an avid cook, included one in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/">his Elmhurst, Queens kitchen renovation.</a> No longer carrying a heavy pot from the sink to the stove allows him to save time and steps. This handy feature will make mashed potato duty at Thanksgiving (or corn on the cob, or pasta-making) much simpler.</p>
<h3><strong>The right kitchen appliances are a must for any Thanksgiving feast</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49067 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /> </span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">When planning a kitchen remodel, updating old appliances bring energy efficiency, increase functionalities, and a modern clean look. Homeowner Katy, who renovated her Hamptons kitchen with Sweeten, called in help to pick new appliances. &#8220;<span>I let my mother-in-law—a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/">holiday-entertaining superwoman choose</a>.&#8221; Among her selections was a single oven &#8220;with the largest cubic heating space she could find.&#8221; </span></p>
<h3><strong>A walk-in pantry makes storage more accessible</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-25562 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Walk-in pantries keep the main kitchen area uncluttered (a difficult task during the holidays!) The extra storage allows food staples, beverages, and canned goods to stay organized. Whether the pantry has a door or an open entry, it adds to the character of the kitchen. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/">Nazli painted her new kitchen pantry</a> a darker shade than the kitchen so the contents blended into the surrounding, seeming to disappear. If you&#8217;re an amateur home chef, consider adding a walk-in pantry for your larger kitchen appliances, pans, and bulk ingredients or spices.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Multifaceted kitchen island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="yellow kitchen tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-33846 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span>Sweeten homeowners Dawn and David added a huge island kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Park Slope kitchen renovation with Sweeten</a>. “People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner.”</span><span>  There is room to prepare food <em>and</em> lay it out beautifully at the same time. (We&#8217;re also huge fans of the yellow Moroccan tile, sure to be a conversation piece with dinner guests!)</span></p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re back in the West Village to check out a Sweeten member&#8217;s newest completed project. After almost 30 years in their 1,000 sqft flat, homeowners Ron &amp; Suzen were excited to give their space a full gut renovation which began early last summer. The home&#8217;s new 1-bed, 2-bath layout is a complete reworking of the former 2-bed, 1-bath arrangement; and a uniquely designed (<a href="/2012/10/11/site-visit-gut-modernization-of-west-village-home-first-look/#more-5425" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and precisely built</a>) open kitchen takes center stage, making it the perfect space to cook and host friends &amp; family. When we stopped by, Peter Maslow and photographer Cary Whittier (<a href="https://carywhittier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carywhittier.com/</a>) were on site as well, snapping some final shots of the completed project.</p>

<dd><span class="img-label"> Built-in shelving and concealed-hardware cabinetry line one wall of the new den. The space has a nice relation to the open kitchen &#8211;enough distance to create privacy when needed, but otherwise still closely connected both spatially &amp; visually.</span></dd>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last week <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-billy-sallys-diy-project-begins-w-thesweeten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we introduced you</a> to a Brooklyn-based couple who have just completed the renovation of their 775 sqft Fort Greene flat: Billy, a freelance web developer (currently at <a href="https://www.paddle8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paddle8</a>), and Sally, a <a href="https://www.sallypaul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painter</a> and museum educator at MoMA, ICP and the American Museum of Folk Art. Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s project got started on Sweeten with preliminary construction work by Sweeten member <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecostruct llc</a>, and subsequently finished up with a full kitchen update and flooring replacement carried out by Billy &amp; Sally themselves (&#8211;some of which is also documented <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on Billy&#8217;s renovation blog). The couple, along with their kitty, Lil&#8217; Miss, recently invited us back to show off the gorgeous results. Their new space is cozy &amp; bright, and, after being put to the test over the holidays, is also a perfect venue for cooking &amp; entertaining!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-6587 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png" alt="stylishly-curated-home-renovation-brooklyn" width="560" height="392" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02.png 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/00_theSweeten_billyandsally02-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here is what the apartment looked like just before Billy &amp; Sally moved in. Throughout the apartment the parquet floors were badly worn and the ceilings showed significant water damage. The kitchen, which was tucked away in a maze of walls, was a tight &amp; dreadfully generic space.</p>
<p><span id="more-6519"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hallway-with-track-lights" class="wp-image-38587 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/02_IMG_8622_1-x-1-723x482.jpg" alt="hallway with track lights and hardwood floors behind kitchen after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/02_IMG_8622_1-x-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/02_IMG_8622_1-x-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/02_IMG_8622_1-x-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Walking in for the first time since <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> ecostruct</a> completed the reconfiguration work, we were so pleased to see how Billy &amp; Sally finished the job! Here in the entry we have our first glimpse of the new flooring and the open kitchen. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38588 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/03_IMG_8781_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Billy &amp; Sally selected a light and modern-looking floor surface of engineered hickory that could actually be installed on top of the existing parquet floors (more on the install <a href="https://billyfowks.com/blog/2012/09/05/flooring-install-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). So, leaving the old parquet surface intact, they removed only the small area of kitchen tiles and replaced them with a layer of sub-flooring before finally working their way through the entire apartment with <a href="https://www.lumberliquidators.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new hickory boards</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38589 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and black countertop and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/04_IMG_8741_1-copy-crop-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />In the kitchen, ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.berensonhardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berenson pulls</a> look clean &amp; modern, and since they&#8217;re more budget-friendly than custom cabinets, the duo was able to splurge on well-designed appliances. We especially love their new Bertazzoni range (available online <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). Other new additions include a refrigerator by <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> and a sleek dishwasher by <a href="https://www.blombergappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blomberg</a>. <img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinet-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38590 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black countertop and undermount stainless steel sink and faucet after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/05_IMG_8824_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Similar to the cabinets, the new kitchen <a href="https://www.ikea.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sink</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucet</a> are also from ikea. <img decoding="async" title="small-open-kitchen-and-dining" class="wp-image-38591 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg" alt="small open kitchen with floating shelves and peninsula island and dining space after renovation" width="723" height="1044" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-723x1044.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-208x300.jpg 208w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_8667_1-600x867.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Above the new kitchen island, the couple chose a pair of all-white pendants which were purchased on ebay.  The open shelving in the far corner is made from ikea <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUMERAR</a> countertops that were cut to fit and mounted on elfa brackets (available at <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Container Store</a>). These shelves remind us a lot of <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-lucky-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the unit ecostruct built for Amanda</a> last summer. <img decoding="async" title="open-shelves-and-white-kitchen-cabinets" class="wp-image-38592 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and open shelves and stainless steel appliances and black countertop after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/07_IMG_8723_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />One of Billy &amp; Sally&#8217;s favorite new features &#8211;and another worthwhile splurge&#8211; are their lovingly-polished <a href="https://www.soapstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soapstone</a> countertops. <img decoding="async" title="peninsula-kitchen-island-with-black-countertop" class="wp-image-38593 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="peninsula kitche island with black countertop and pendant light and hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/08_IMG_8707_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />Looking back into the living area, it&#8217;s clear that cooking is now a social activity rather than a private one. <img decoding="async" title="floating-book-shelves-in-living-room" class="wp-image-38594 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg" alt="floating book shelves on white wall in living room with hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/09_IMG_8728_1-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />More open shelving in the living space makes for lovely &amp; efficient storage, as well as a nice display alongside the couple&#8217;s unique art collection. Best of all, the repeated shelving details weave this space together with the kitchen.</p>
<p>BIG thanks to Billy &amp; Sally for sharing their beautiful renovation!</p>
