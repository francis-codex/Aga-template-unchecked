<p>One of the delights of internet searches is that they often lead you to things you didn&#8217;t even know you cared about.  While researching gas ranges the other day I stumbled across this image of a &#8220;compact kitchen,&#8221; a single, 30&#8243;-wide appliance that contains a range, refrigerator and sink. As an architect I pine for everything to be extraordinarily beautiful and elegant, but there&#8217;s something about the stubborn practicality of these pieces that&#8217;s incredibly appealing. Compact kitchens like this one by <a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avanti</a> have won me over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4798380536_2860ae553e.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN AVANTI BLACK" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.avantiproducts.com/products/cat/50" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4797750299_61335e474f.jpg alt=" fridge="" compact="compact" kitchen="" avanti="" white="" open="" /></a></p>
<p>These appliances are commonly installed in offices, RV&#8217;s, dorm and hotel rooms, and basements. But they&#8217;d work beautifully in New York City apartment too, when there&#8217;s not quite enough space for a conventional kitchen. You could just tuck one of these units into the corner of the dining room, at the end of the hall, or in a coat closet.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been around for quite a while. General Air Conditioning made a compact kitchen in the 1950&#8217;s that was featured in <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apartment Therapy</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chicago/good-questions/good-questions-modern-allinone-kitchen-060421" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4798381490_d4c07769b2.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN VINTAGE GE" /></a></p>
<p>In 1964 <a href="https://www.boffi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boffi</a> manufactured a &#8220;Mini Kitchen&#8221; designed by Joe Colombo, and they&#8217;ve since developed an updated model. The original model doesn&#8217;t look like an appliance at all. Encased in stained wood panels, with concealed burners and secret pull-out drawers, it has the geometric purity of cubist sculpture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4797750619_3381ef93d3.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN BOFFI 1964" /></p>
<p>The most basic units are modest in appearance and don&#8217;t cost any more than an ordinary gas range would. But there are also larger, more expensive units that are actually quite handsome. Compact Concepts makes a full-height round, rotating unit that comes equipped with a dishwasher and storage cabinets, and that&#8217;s available in different high-fashion finishes. It would look lovely in a raw, open, loft-like space.</p>

<p>A few years ago architect Zaha Hadid designed two kitchen units, &#8220;Fire&#8221; and &#8220;Water,&#8221; in collaboration with <a href="https://www.dupont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a> and <a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernestomeda</a>. They look more like a spaceship command center than a kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ernestomeda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4798381136_32cd53df84.jpg alt=" table="" compact="compact" kitchen="" z="" island="" /></a></p>
<p>Dutch designer Sietze Kalwijk had the opposite approach, stripping typical kitchen fixtures and appliances of all their displays, controls, and shells. This compact kitchen provides only the bare essentials: a burner, a sink, a work surface, and hose connections for gas and water.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kalkwijk.com/ximage/pid/144/i/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4798380674_9da747e894.jpg" alt="COMPACT KITCHEN KYDEX" /></a></p>
<p>Maybe one reason these compact kitchens are so appealing is that they make cooking seem simpler and more fun. While a skilled cook could prepare a gorgeous meal with one, for the rest of us they&#8217;re just wonderful playthings.</p>
