<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Serving as either an open gathering place or a cozy retreat, the deck has become a popular alternative to the patio and porch. Outdoor deck materials have improved in durability and beauty, with a range of types to choose from. Rather than choosing based on looks alone, it&#8217;s useful to know the pros and cons of the most common material options available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of the deck&#8217;s foundation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how you design it or outfit it with planters and pergolas, at its essence the deck is a large outdoor platform. Typically, it is connected to the house, and raised from the ground anywhere from a few inches to several feet. This is in contrast to a patio, which is made of stone or concrete and set into the earth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though made from moisture-resistant or repellent material, decks should be isolated from the ground by supports set into concrete footers. Contact with soil will eventually rot any kind of wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decking boards come in specially milled or manufactured sizes that are typically 2-by-4s, though widths can vary from a given manufacturer to provide you with more design options. Look for rounded edges that resist splintering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will find many choices for joining systems. Some systems conceal screw heads, for a cleaner appearance and and to keep water from seeping into screw holes. Other systems are designed to allow expansion and contraction of the boards. “Decking boards with slotted sides can be installed using a clip system, so you do not have to surface fasten the boards,” says Doug L. Mucher, Senior Marketing Manager for <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/decking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed</a>. “This provides a cleaner installation.”</p>

<h3>Zoning and local codes for outdoor decks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure your deck is in compliance, deck supports are best installed by an experienced contractor who knows the local codes and zoning laws. Some cities or counties require approval from the planning commission and inspections during the building process. Keep in mind: these rules might limit your grand plans, or require some creative adaptations. It&#8217;s wise to consult with your contractor before proceeding with the build. “Most homeowners can handle replacing the deck surface,” says Mucher. “However, if the project requires the deck substructure to be built as well, you’ll most likely want to hire a contractor. A contractor can be required to make sure it is built to code.”</p>
<h3>How to choose outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Your choice of outdoor deck materials will be driven by your lifestyle, taste, and local climate. Does your area get a lot of rain and humidity? Heat and sun? Most modern deck materials can withstand any climate, but some require more upkeep than others to stay in good shape and appearance, especially in harsher climates.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Different types of outdoor deck materials</h3>
<p>Wood continues to be a popular choice. If you like classic materials, you can choose from a range of softwoods and hardwoods. You&#8217;ll get good-to-great performance, as long as you follow a regular maintenance routine. There are some synthetic alternatives, too. Consider the following:</p>
<h4>Pressure-treated pine hardwood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: This is an inexpensive softwood that&#8217;s been impregnated with chemical preservatives, making it more resistant to insects and to splitting, swelling, and rot from humidity than other woods. It&#8217;s easy to paint. It&#8217;s also strong, and well-suited to the structural parts of the deck, even if you choose different woods for the deck surface and other visible elements. Pressure-treated pine is the thriftiest option, so it&#8217;s good for homeowners on a strict budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: It is a natural material and requires frequent maintenance to assure top performance. Pressure-treated pine is not as attractive as some other popular wood options, including cedar or redwood. As with all real wood, it can splinter. Upkeep includes deep cleaning and application of a lumber preservative annually as well as occasional sanding. The chemicals used in the pressure treatment are toxic. This isn&#8217;t typically a problem in an outdoor setting, but some homeowners prefer to keep this treated wood in places like the deck&#8217;s support structure, where they won&#8217;t have to come in direct contact with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $1.50 per square foot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50575 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Non-treated wood</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: There’s a reason why many synthetic decking materials simulate the look of wood. There is nothing like this natural material for its warmth and expression of quality. The most popular softwood species are cedar and redwood, for their good looks and natural moisture resistance. Natural tannins and oils resist insects well, and these woods are easy to stain, paint, and seal. Some decks are built with tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, which are incredibly resilient, and in some cases are accepted by fire codes that otherwise require concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Even hardwoods are not as long-lasting as plastics. Wood can dent, split, splinter, fade, and require frequent upkeep to maintain the best appearance and life. You will need to not only wash with a wood cleaner or pressure-washer, but also seal it at least once annually. Best to sweep daily or weekly to avoid damage from gritty dirt. Darker shades will heat up in sunlight, making them unpleasant underfoot in the summer when you are likely to spend the most time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot for cedar; from $6 per square foot for redwood, $8 per square foot for ipe.</p>
<h4>Composite</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: Made from wood fibers bound by a resin, synthetic decking is nearly maintenance-free. It will not warp, splinter, or rot, and it repels insects. It requires no stain or sealing and offers a wide selection of simulated wood looks and colors. It also can be molded and so lends itself to curved shapes. It requires little care except cleaning with soapy water and a soft-bristle brush.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: Surfaces in darker colors can become hot in the sun and may fade over time. It can melt if exposed to high heat, such as from a grill. Scratches can’t be buffed out, and dropped greasy foods might leave stains. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $5 per square foot.</p>
<h4>PVC</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PRO: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a thermoplastic that can be shaped and formed into a variety of products including decking. A particularly hard plastic, it won’t scratch, warp, rot, split, or stain; it’s lightweight and easy to install and requires no annual treatments other than cleaning with soap and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CON: More limited palette than composite. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $4 per square foot.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Vinyl</h4>
<p>PRO: Lightweight vinyl is comprised of PVC and polyethylene. Available in faux-wood styles and textures, this material is easy to install thanks to its light weight and ease of slicing with a saw. It never needs painting, resists staining and fading, and won’t heat up, unlike natural wood and some composites. Easy to clean with soap and water.</p>
<p>CON: Over time, it may sag. It will not break down in a landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COST: From $3 per square foot.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30735 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck with pergola" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Pergola-723x482.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to personalize your outdoor deck</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve narrowed down your choice of material, you can think about ways to customize the deck. “With all the styles and colors available, homeowners are really only limited by their imagination,” says Mucher.</p>
<h4>Outdoor deck design ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mix different colors or shades of planks</li>
<li>Combine different plank widths</li>
<li>Run planks in different directions to create a pattern, like a herringbone or a fan</li>
<li>Add a contrasting border</li>
<li>Paint on a stenciled motif</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30738 mb-10 size-chrono" title="outdoor deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chiminea1-723x736.jpg" alt="deck cost" width="723" height="736" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><span class="img-label"> <span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Deck by CertainTeed</span></span></p>
<h4>Make the deck resemble an actual room:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create steps and two or more levels for different activities, such as relaxing, dining, taking in the view</li>
<li>Install an outdoor kitchen, chiminea (freestanding, front-loading fireplace or oven), or spa</li>
<li>Incorporate a pergola or a lanai</li>
<li>Include lighting, for use at night or to highlight an area</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, most decks, particularly those that are raised or tiered, include a railing. You can match your deck material or choose a complementary style or finish. Work with your contractor to make sure all the necessary elements are incorporated, for safety and security as well as environment and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Invest time in planning and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selecting a vetted general contractor</a> to guide you through the process. You want your deck to be dependable and a space you enjoy sharing with family and guests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

<p class="p1">Enjoy a change of scenery in your own home. Outdoor spaces present an increase in living space and an upgrade to lifestyle. However, not all backyards are ready for “prime time” and a remodel is in order. NYC landscaping costs for the backyard include scope, flooring, demolition, fencing, electrical, and structures.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every outdoor space can be improved</a> substantially with some great ideas and expert help. Our guide will help you understand the most common elements to consider in NYC with some tips from our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors. </p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Building an outdoor space: where to start</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor space runs the gamut from a simple patio to a full outdoor kitchen. What you can achieve at your home is going to be limited by three main factors: space available, your budget, and building codes. Of those three factors, codes might be the most perplexing—and least flexible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the most part, building codes exist for safety and you can either comply or change the design. They’re not that onerous for most outdoor projects, but you might face challenges from setbacks, for example. That means you can’t build right up to the property line in certain cases. Once you <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a NYC contractor</a> to work with, your GC will be invaluable in guiding you through design decisions that meet your desires <i>and</i> codes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Space available and budget are easier to grasp. When your contractor gives you a good idea of the buildable space and rough estimates for your “must-haves” and optional features, you can get going on your plan. Do a deep dive and check out projects that appeal to you. Creating a photo montage of completed projects that get you all frothy is a fun way to design!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg" alt="Backyard with stained cedar fencing along with white chairs and lawn grass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50617" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3910-KV-Yard-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) General contractor Santiago renovated this <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/k-v-harpers-lush-backyard-renovation-sweeten-in-bed-stuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backyard space</a> for Sweeten homeowner KV Harper</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Backyard landscaping cost: Outdoor flooring </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Knowing how you want to use your space is the first step to setting the budget. The outdoor-room concept is multi-faceted. Some people don’t want much besides a table for meals, others want to sunbathe, some want a spa, and the cooks want a full kitchen. Whatever your wants, you’ll have to start at the bottom: what you walk on. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you have an existing patio or roof to use, great, then you can move on to other elements. If your space does need some help with the flooring, though, you’ll find a host of possibilities. One of the most popular options, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor Santiago</a> in New York, is bluestone patios. This material is durable and beautiful, if fairly expensive. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bluestone is a natural stone paver that offers beauty, durability, and flexibility. Cut bluestone pavers will cost from around $8/square foot for 1” thick stone and is available in many sizes. Smaller stones of about 12” square will give you a slightly different aesthetic than huge slabs, and are definitely easier to work with. Access can be a challenge in the city, and you might have to spring for a crane if you want large, heavy stones. There’s just no other way to move them in tight spaces. This process will cost you at least $2,000, not including the stone and site preparation. Smaller sizes are more manageable, though, and can be hauled by hand if necessary.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Concrete pavers cost</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To spend less, “Concrete pavers are available in dozens of size and color options for $4–5/square foot,” Santiago said. In addition, they don’t need a crane for installation. Installation for both concrete and stone pavers will be the same, with costs varying depending on the current base rather than the material you choose. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Calculating your backyard landscaping costs</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/nyc-landscaping-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Determining your </span><span class="s2">backyard landscaping costs</span></a><span class="s1"> are also determined by demolition work. That type of work will vary by what you have in place now, so contractors don’t want to guess on costs. Do you have an existing patio that must be removed? Or grass? How good is the access? Are you working on the ground floor or higher up? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are so many variables that rough estimates without seeing the site aren’t possible, our contractors said. They need to see what’s there first and learn what you want before they can give an estimate. </span>Post your project on Sweeten to discuss the possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="s1">“I have to look at the job; two jobs are never alike. Labor is not easy to price. There are a lot of elements factoring in,” Santiago noted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">NYC-based Sweeten general contractor Steve concurred, saying that there are backyard remodeling jobs where all materials have to come in and out through the front door. “A lot of the time you have to take the garbage out through the first floor, out the basement, or out the window. Everything has to be protected.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg" alt="Small backyard deck with inbuilt seating and brick wall background after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50575" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/55596-Jessica-Backyard-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Jessica&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/backyard-deck-goes-wall-to-wall-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deck renovation</a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to patios, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decks are popular</a> and sometimes do not require demolition and hauling out old materials. Decks can offer great flexibility in fitting into existing spaces, and they can also be particularly budget-friendly by overlaying an existing shabby concrete slab, saving the cost and hassle of demolition and removal.</span></p>
<h3>When to start planning your outdoor space</h3>
<p><span>Enjoy your green space for the summer by starting the process early. Use the summer months prior to gather inspiration. In the Fall, begin planning with an architect/designer/contractor on design, landscaping, and materials. By December submit permits, hire your contractor, and order materials (keep delivery times in mind). Demolition should break ground by March/April. Depending on the complexity of the project, an outdoor remodel typically takes two months to finish. Although an outdoor kitchen requiring plumbing, gas, and electrical could take longer for approvals vs a deck remodel.</span><span> </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Creating fencing and perimeter walls</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fences and walls, too, are basic elements of most projects, and serve several functions. Privacy is usually a main concern, but view control and wind control are also important. Most people opt for wood fences, said Steve. As for design elements, “People in general want big wide planks; materials that are more architectural looking, with bright backgrounds,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“It depends on each client. Some people want a lot of space for seating. For all intents and purposes it’s an outside living room,” he noted. Fences offer a lot of design freedom, as well, including horizontal and vertical elements, natural wood tones or painted surfaces, and using wood, stone, and/or metal. “Most people do wood fencing,” Sweeten contractor Santiago said, “some choose pressure-treated, while others opt for cedar. It depends on the budget.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Outdoor lighting </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some details, such as lighting, are easy to overlook at first. It’s a major element in both ambiance and useability, however, and should be tackled at the design stage rather than tacked on later.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Everyone is into lighting,” Santiago said. “For this, you&#8217;ll need to factor in outlets. Floodlights can accent the plants. They can be simple but very cool.” Lighting and electrical are simple and easy compared to some other elements, but they require planning for running buried lines and removing overhead lines. When your contractor has a design for you, then it’s time to consider the lighting based on function. Lighting in the dining area is different from lighting for walkways and for plants. It’s all part of the design process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Adding pergolas and arbors</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As another distinct element, pergolas and arbors provide shade, structure, and beauty to your outdoor room, as well as an often-needed vertical feature. Arbors are simple and small structures that often frame a pathway, while pergolas are larger and more substantial, sometimes attached to the house. You might train vines or climbing roses on the arbor, for example. Pergolas can use a slatted, cloth, or solid roofing material, making them flexible so you have both sun and shelter in your yard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Landscaping front yard</span><span class="s3"> options</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In New York City, front yard spaces aren’t as common, but you can still add natural beauty. In addition to using fine materials for your front entry, steps, and railing, do you have room for planters? If you like plants, this is a great option for tight spaces and lets you add some color and texture. If live plants are too much work or tough to keep alive, planters can also house durable and seasonal items like spruce tops. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can see a multitude of high-quality planters and pots online, and talk with your contractor about building some that fit your space exactly. Many people choose cedar for this project, as it’s beautiful and relatively rot-resistant. Other woods work fine, too, and can look great finished in paint or stain. Add your ideas to your photo montage and discuss with your renovation team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Landscaping costs</span><span class="s1"> for homes in New York City can be tough to estimate without a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit from several firms</a>. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home or outdoor remodel, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with the right local contractor</a> to get you to your dream space. </span></p>
