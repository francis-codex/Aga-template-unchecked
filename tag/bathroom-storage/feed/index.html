			<h2>A double sink vanity can introduce extra space to spread out in the bathroom, without skimping on style</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05.jpg" alt="built-in bath storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you have the space, adding a double-sink vanity when remodeling your bathroom comes with many benefits. This luxury allows two people to simultaneously share the room while having personal space. Time is saved and each has use of their own sink.</p>
<p>Double-sink vanities also offer extra storage space, with options like additional drawers and cabinets. The positive upgrades add up to an increase in home value for many homeowners. Here, we show six Sweeten renovators who chose double-sink vanities when renovating their baths.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>A double-sink vanity for a touch of luxury</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02.jpg" alt="black tile shower and white barn door" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50861" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Despite multiple hurdles put in Isis and Stephano’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-brooklyn-brownstone-bathroom-gets-its-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation path</a> for a long-awaited bathroom remodel, the couple persevered. From misaligned measurements to a barn door that was too heavy to be installed, their contractor worked out solutions for each issue. “It took amazing Tetris skills” to also fit the double sink vanity that had gotten cut off. The dream bathroom would serve the family of five well with double sinks, a shower, and laundry.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> If you are thinking of upgrading from a single to a double sink, remember to factor in the cost of additional plumbing.</p>
<h3>Updating for a forever home</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46861 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="Chicago bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Leah and Brian wanted to make their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago condo more modern</a>. It would be a home they planned on staying in—not selling. They focused on renovating their kitchen and bath, moving away from the browns and beiges. For the bath, they kept the footprint the same. They already had a double-sink vanity, so they just upgraded it with a more contemporary one. They replaced the busy brown and white marble with a muted gray-white countertop.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Know your size. Standard single-sink vanities range anywhere from 36-48 inches. Standard double-sink vanities are much longer, ranging from 60-72 inches. Talk with your contractor and check that your space can fit this design.</p>
<h3>A tight—but golden-glamorous—double sink</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44091 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />For Jenifer Herrmann, a media exec, and her partner, Mitzie Wong, a designer, painter, and co-founder of creative design firm Roar + Rabbit, it was important to have their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home reflect their styles and personalities.</a> They came to Sweeten and found a contractor to bring their master bath in Brooklyn to life. &#8220;Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat,&#8221; said Jenifer, &#8220;since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vanity they chose doesn&#8217;t have cabinets but luckily their Sweeten contractor came to the rescue. During demolition, he found an extra 6-8 inches in depth between the wall studs, which they used as additional storage space.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Make sure you meet both your form and function needs, like Jenifer and Mitzie. Even though their selected vanity didn&#8217;t have storage, they were able to add it elsewhere. There are many different styles of double sink vanities—free-standing, wall-mounted, floating—so be sure to match your style preferences with your everyday needs.</p>
<h3>A bright, airy, and shareable double sink setup</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-hexagon-floor-tiles-brown-vanity" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44090 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="black hexagon floor tiles with brown floating vanity and white double sink and long wide mirror vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-600x898.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-585x875.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Jill and Cy needed more space for their family. Instead of moving to the suburbs, they purchased a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 1,920-square-foot townhome</a>. Jill wanted a master bath that would accommodate their busy lifestyle. It needed to be bright, airy, and functional. She selected a double-sink vanity that she and Cy could share easily with long drawers for storage. In addition, she had her Sweeten contractor custom build the mirror and medicine cabinets above to match the floating vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> There are many benefits of a double-sink vanity. A key benefit? Saved time. Two sinks make it easy for couples or families to get through their morning routines without disrupting or delaying each other.</p>
<h3>A dresser produces the feel of a living space</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1.jpg" alt="repurposed double sink vanity table" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47468" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowners Liz and Kevin planned their new <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom remodel</a> around their love of mid-century design. They purchased a vintage walnut dresser in hopes of repurposing it into a sink vanity. A high-rimmed, shallow trough sink sat on top. The height of the sink raised the low-sitting dresser to standard vanity height. Brass fixtures and orange penny backsplash completed the mid-century look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> If you lose storage space during the renovation process, vanities can make up for it. There are so many free-standing, double-sink vanities to choose from that have multiple drawers and cabinets to accommodate all your necessities.</p>
<h3>A sink for two with sensory features</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42065" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For their master <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/fixer-upper-washington-heights-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation</a>, Isis and Andre decided it would look unique, be efficient, and have spa-like qualities. Their architect surprised them with a sketch of an unpredictable infinity soapstone dual sink. They loved it. Black penny tile injects shape and movement opposite 24” x 24” stone-like wall tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Additional sinks can increase your home’s value. A bathroom vanity with more space and a personal sink is an upgrade for many homeowners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Be open to the idea of unconcealed storage  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how big your bathroom is, the first thought to reduce clutter would be to keep it all tucked away in drawers and cabinets. But when things are out of sight, they are also harder to find. Strategically-placed open shelving adds visual interest and can make life a little easier. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has seen many renovators creatively add open storage to their baths. From recessed open shelving to floating shelves, see what ideas you might want to incorporate in your own bathroom renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27546" title="recessed shelving" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria and Eric’s small bath needed storage that would blend seamlessly with their minimalist Scandinavian apartment. A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recessed wall unit with open shelves </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the perfect solution. Plus, hiding it behind the door means it’s only visible when the door is closed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38081 size-full" title="black-and-white-bathroom-with-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg" alt="white subway tiles with black grout and black shower head and fixtures and bathtub and floating wooden shelves above toilet and vanity with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classic open shelves</a> are always a good idea. In Saira’s bathroom, they provided extra storage for the family of four and brought contrast to the otherwise black and white space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38622 size-full" title="hexagon-wall-tiles-and-recessed-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="off-white hexagon tiles on walls and white bathtub and recessed shelves on wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica’s general contractor took open storage to the next level with </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/zen-bathroom-renovation-windsor-terrace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shower niches featuring glass shelves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The integrated organization idea is as practical as it is pretty.</span></p>

<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>

They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When they began looking for more space, Chelsea residents Lauren and Ross didn’t want to move far from their Manhattan neighborhood. Luckily, they found a new home in Kensington House, an Art Deco co-op building just three blocks from their old place. The two-bed, two-bath apartment featured plentiful space for entertaining—a must for Lauren, a food industry professional, as well as the perfect nook for Ross’ piano. The baths in this Emory Roth-designed building were true to their 1930s roots, with out-of-style tiling, industrial flushometer toilets, and exposed radiator pipes that were an unattractive hazard. The couple tapped the interior design firm White Arrow to create hotel-inspired baths with more storage. Read also about their choice for color and a unique, space-saving pocket door solution.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ross, and I purchased a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea last year. We were already living in a one-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood and wanted to upgrade to an apartment that had more space. After about three months of looking, we found the perfect apartment, only three blocks from where we were living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the loft-style layout of the apartment we found, but the bathrooms were in a bit of a sorry state. The tile was outdated and one of the baths had a huge old-school metal tub stopper located next to the toilet. So we planned on gutting the two spaces along with a few extra upgrades, such as replacing the kitchen’s backsplash and lighting, sanding the floors, repainting the apartment, removing a desk in the study to accommodate a piano, and turning a less-than-ideal barn door in the dining foyer into a more discreet pocket door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hired <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>, a friend’s sister’s design company to assist us with the design process, and they, in turn, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our contractor</a>. Our Sweeten contractor was also very helpful throughout the design process and suggested modifications and tweaks to the original design that best fit our needs.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">Creating a wide barn pocket door proved to be a challenge but &#8220;our contractor suggested we attach three store-bought doors together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We initially budgeted two to three months for the renovation process, and typical for New York, ended up taking about four months. The apartment’s previous tenants took all of their light fixtures with them when they moved out, so we purchased new light fixtures for all of the rooms. I created a Pinterest board to help refine my ideas. We especially love the distinctive CB2 chandelier which hangs above our dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a food writer and having written <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Kitchens-Behind-Burner-Hanoi/dp/B00AK2TMOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Kitchens</a></em>, a book about working in restaurants around the world, it was important for me to have a clean, streamlined kitchen for cooking and entertaining. We loved the custom cabinets that were already in place but wanted to update the backsplash by installing white subway tiles to replace the existing small red-and-brown multicolored ones. We also swapped out the sink faucet for a contemporary Grohe fixture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross loves playing piano, and with this apartment, we were finally able to accommodate a piano in our space. We removed a wooden plank which the previous owners had used as a desk and created a nook which was a perfect spot for an upright piano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating the pocket door separating the dining area from the bedroom proved a bit of a challenge at first, but our contractor helpfully suggested that we attach three store-bought doors together, and then build a fake wall over what used to be the space for the barn door. This would be a more affordable solution than purchasing a custom wood door, which he noted would be very expensive. We then painted the door and surrounding walls Hamilton Blue by Benjamin Moore, a color we had in our old apartment, and one that we knew looked good as a backdrop for our artwork. Also in the dining area, we covered a pipe that had previously been exposed. We had initially wanted to get rid of it since it was in the middle of the walkway, but this was not possible. Our unit was originally two apartments that had been combined at some point in the past, and the pipe had been inside the dividing walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathrooms probably required the most work. Our designers initially suggested moving around the placement of the sink and toilet to maximize space, but this was going to require additional permits and more time. As such, we ended up leaving the tubs, sinks, and toilets in the same places, and just upgraded with new fixtures. I love taking baths so we got deep-soaking tubs for both bathrooms, as well as <a href="https://www.totousa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilets</a>. For the master bath, I was inspired by the clean, elegant look of hotel bathrooms and wanted marble walls to be a focus of that space. We opted for a glass panel on the tub, which our contractor sourced for us. We also covered unattractive heating pipes with grates from <a href="https://www.archgrille.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Grille</a>. Custom shelving was added in the form of a shower niche, as well as a large in-wall cabinet opposite the sink.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the guest bath, a simple white tile with black grout was chosen to complement the Coyuchi shower curtain and an Of a Kind planter we had brought from our previous bathroom. We ran into some issues with the tiles purchased by our designers for the guest bath, so our contractor made suggestions that helped the material work in the space. Contemporary <a href="https://www.graff-designs.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graff shower fixtures</a> were selected for both showers. As for the color palette, we chose white because it was a neutral color, and it is just very soothing to have a white bathroom. Both looks are timeless, and we figured they would be appealing to us now and hopefully to anyone who bought the apartment later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the four months of work, we were able to move into our new space, which we now love. We tried to create a contemporary space that reflects our personal tastes while adding elements which also capture the Art Deco heritage of our apartment building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>
