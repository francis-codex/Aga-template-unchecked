<p>Renovating on Long Island? From the South Shore to the North Fork, we have the numbers you’ll need to plan your renovation&#8217;s budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> breaks down the costs on four major remodeling cost categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Although “Long Island” is technically a region that is home to four New York counties, including Kings County (better known as Brooklyn!) and Queens, this cost guide focuses on the portion of the island that is colloquially known as Long Island, which is primarily Nassau and Suffolk counties. This guide does not include the Hamptons, which is a world of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-hamptons-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own with renovation prices</a> to match.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs that include labor and materials compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf) with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+</strong> psf</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> (under 100 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$30,000</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$75,000+</strong> (for 200 square feet)</li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$15,000—$20,000</strong> (35 to 40 square feet)</li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel: <strong>$21,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000+</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind while it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</p>
<h3>What does a Long Island home remodel cost per square foot?</h3>
<p>Long Island’s proximity to New York City and the Hamptons means that the same regional averages apply. However, real estate prices in Long Island are lower than their neighbors on both sides, and this affects renovation costs.</p>
<p>Most full-home Sweeten renovations in villages including Great Neck, New Hyde Park, and Bellport generally start at <strong>$100</strong> psf.<span style="color: #333333;"> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4914#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Aaron</a> estimates that cosmetic facelifts for dry rooms can be <strong>$30</strong>—<strong>$70</strong> psf </span><span style="color: #333333;">for his projects, while </span><span style="color: #333333;">wet rooms (rooms that are connected to a water supply, i.e., bathrooms or kitchens) typically start at <strong>$375</strong> per square feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In Sweeten&#8217;s experience, bathrooms in Long Island are typically larger than 5&#8217;x8&#8242; and can measure 8&#8243;x7&#8242; or 9&#8243;x7&#8242;. High-end (full custom, luxury materials) wet room renovations can cost well over <strong>$700</strong> per square foot. This cost range includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<h5>Fewer hurdles in Long Island</h5>
<p>Since most residential renovations in Long Island are for single-family, fully detached houses, the logistics of renovation are more straightforward. Contractors won&#8217;t need to worry about where to park a car or have limits on the permitted construction hours. (Even if there are city ordinances that limit noise, those are much longer than the working hours typically permitted by an NYC co-op.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, apartment buildings, whether condo or co-op, typically require contractors to ensure cleanliness in the hallways. When workers must spend the beginning and end of the workday prepping and cleaning the halls, this can take up precious time! These factors, which don’t impact most Long Island houses, can result in more affordable prices for those renovators.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Aaron tells us that, since construction was permitted to restart after the shutdown, clients are itching to get back to their renovations. The most common renovations he’s seeing are additions, dormers, kitchens, baths, pool pavers, and decks.</span></p>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island kitchen renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can cost between <strong>$20,000—$30,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. This typically means making use of engineered flooring, off-the-shelf cabinets, and an economical tile or butcher block for countertops. It also includes swapping out old appliances for energy-efficient models.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Sweeten has seen costs starting at <strong>$30,000</strong>. <em>Remodeling</em>’s Cost vs. Value Report shows that a mid-grade, major kitchen renovation of a 200-square-foot space will run about <strong>$69,910</strong> based on averages for the Middle Atlantic region (as opposed to <strong>$84,484</strong> for New York City). This range covers updating 30 linear feet of semi-custom wood cabinets, an island, new countertops, a double-tub stainless steel sink, energy-efficient range, vented hood, built-in microwave, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and custom lighting. This comes to about <strong>$350</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5543#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Vita</a>, “Kitchens on Long Island typically need a full gut in order to upgrade electrical, plumbing, insulation, and correcting for settling of the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li>High-end kitchen: Expect the budget to start at <strong>$75,000</strong>. The same Cost vs. Value report puts a luxury kitchen renovation around <strong>$137,700</strong> for the region. This will get you top-of-the-line custom cabinets with interior accessories, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, commercial-grade cooktop and hood, wall oven, built-in microwave, with designer faucets and a water filtration system. This budget also includes custom lighting, including under-cabinet lights, and wood flooring throughout. Broken down to price per square foot, this comes in at <strong>$689</strong> psf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Costs for a Long Island bathroom renovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes. Sweeten contractor Vita said, “Bathroom remodels often need the same treatment as kitchens, and require a full overhaul of plumbing, electrical supplies, insulation, exhaust ductwork as well as floor and wall straightening. Our base price for a typically-sized, 35-square-foot bathroom renovation starts at <strong>$22,158</strong>, with material and subcontractor allowances.”</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom remodel for a 35-square-foot area will cost anywhere from <strong>$21,000</strong> to <strong>$40,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report provides an average of <strong>$22,158</strong> for the Middle Atlantic region. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, a solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: Sweeten contractors report high-end renovations range starts at <strong>$40,000</strong> and goes up at luxury price points. The same report puts a high-end renovation at <strong>$69,188</strong> for the region. This is based on the expansion of a 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, within the existing home&#8217;s footprint. A high-end renovation at this price point includes radiant floors, all new ductwork, custom cabinetry, separate shower, and freestanding tub, as well as custom lighting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Costs for a Long Island basement renovation</h3>
<p>Based on Sweeten&#8217;s numbers, the average basement conversion in Long Island comes in at <strong>$117</strong> psf. For a budget, we&#8217;ve seen projects start at <strong>$25,000</strong> and include a bathroom, shower, and laminate flooring. On the high end, a project costing <strong>$75,000</strong> would include a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring in 20’ x 30’ space.</p>
<p>This is in line with what is reported by Sweeten contractors. For example, Sweeten contractor Vita shares that Long Island basements generally run about <strong>$35,000</strong> for a budget, <strong>$60,000</strong> for a mid-grade renovation, and more than <strong>$60,000</strong> for a high-end project.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the existing condition of the space will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper so the ceiling appears higher, and the walls could require underpinning. Sometimes electricity and plumbing need to be installed, especially if there is no existing bathroom and that’s a crucial part of your plans. Installation and waterproofing can also be a significant cost if needed.</p>
<h3>Costs for permits</h3>
<p>In Long Island, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. Towns throughout the island all levy different fees. In Suffolk County, for renovations up to <strong>$50,000</strong>, the permit fee is <strong>$250</strong>, and <strong>$500</strong> for renovations up to <strong>$100,000</strong>. For projects above <strong>$250,000</strong>, contractor Aaron estimates the cost is 15%  per <strong>$1,000</strong> for the permit. Plumbing and electrical permits both start at <strong>$50</strong>. For the full list, you can consult this fee schedule.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves,” so you can plan and get started off on the right foot.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27189 size-chrono" title="retail store" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Designer Rebecca Taylor store&nbsp;project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor David</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>

<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
