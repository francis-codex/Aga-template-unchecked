<h3>Making your galley kitchen bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The key to making your galley kitchen inspiration successful is all about maximizing the available square footage. But when you&#8217;ve optimized every inch and <em>still</em> need more space, the question becomes: <strong>how do you make a galley kitchen bigger?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Demolishing the entire kitchen and its surrounding walls is not always a realistic option. Bringing down walls partially provides some openness while not eliminating all walls which are important for storage. Another way to expand a galley kitchen layout is by allowing the kitchen to extend into nearby living spaces. See how the five Sweeten renovations below snuck in a little more outside their two walls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A countertop extension perfect for parties</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24796" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of taking down walls to open things up, Joel and Eric worked with their designers to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wraparound kitchen countertop</a> to join the kitchen and nearby dining room. The one-piece counter is perfect for hosting parties: it provides a spot for pouring drinks and serving buffet-style dinners without leaving the kitchen. As a bonus, the extended storage helps mitigate the build-up of clutter.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Simple solution: a pass-through</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="built in oven in a kitchen pass through" width="2000" height="3000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Gina and Andrew’s kitchen was closed off from the rest of their apartment. As a layout, being closed off isn’t always undesired. However, the couple wanted to move beyond their dark galley kitchen, which also had an awkward layout. Their plans required moving a load-bearing wall. Therefore, architectural drawings needed to be submitted for approval. It was worth it for their Sweeten contractor to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-seat breakfast bar</a> (and fit a stackable washer and dryer). The pass-through gave a new dimension to the galley layout. It also created a welcomed social aspect between the kitchen and dining area. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>A patio comes inside</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43703 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg" alt="bay window" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laura and Tim were ready to trade in their “old and grungy” kitchen in their 1929 brick townhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  They </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remodeled their galley kitchen</a> and kept the layout—with one major change. They enclosed an outdoor patio at the back of the kitchen that had a drafty door which was also poorly located. The new plan was to envelop the patio into the cook space and the adjacent dining area. What started as a kitchen remodel turned into a full-blown extension project. A skylight in the new enclosure brought in a stream of natural light.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Galley kitchen inspiration: Turn the corner</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Melissa and Blake's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shifting the location of a nearby closet allowed Melissa and Blake to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enlarge the galley kitchen</a> into the living room. This created space for more cabinets, a wine rack, and counter space. Their Sweeten contractor removed a second closet also outside the kitchen and built a bar counter with seating in its place. By &#8220;turning the corners&#8221; off the galley, the couple gained a lot more kitchen space.</p>
<h3>Separating the dining area from the kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27107 size-chrono" title="Lisa and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
Moving the eating nook outside of the kitchen allowed Lisa and Chris to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend their cabinets</a> along the back wall. The sink and stove remained in the same locations. However, the fridge was relocated allowing the opposite wall to have a long continuous countertop. A part of the wall was partially removed to create a large, eat-in peninsula. The extremely cramped galley kitchen now felt more open and organized.</p>
