										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A remodel brings major storage points and a new bath</h2>
<p><em>Mimi’s new one-bed, one-bath apartment in Manhattan’s neighborhood of Gramercy checked off quite a few boxes. But revamping an outdated bathroom and installing new wood flooring would just be the start to making the 600-square-foot home the way she wanted. With an architect’s plans in hand, she needed help getting over the hump of the process of finding a general contractor. Mimi found one at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, who turned the drawings into reality, including a walk-in closet and an 18-foot-long bookshelf. Read on to see how she even managed a vacation in the middle of her renovation.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40489 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em>Guest blog post by homeowner Mimi</em></p>
<p>I had been looking for quite a while—nearly a year, on and off—before I found my apartment. For the longest time, I only viewed turnkey apartments because I was intimidated by the idea of renovating my own space and didn’t even know where I’d start. But no space had the exact features I was looking for, so I had to expand my search.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40490 size-full" title="homeowner portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg" alt="homeowner portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40499" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before.jpg" alt="before floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After.jpg" alt="after floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Finally, I found an apartment that felt like the right size and fit for me living as a single twenty-something in the city—great neighborhood and convenient to work, plenty of light (very important since my previous apartment was on the second floor and never saw any direct sunlight), previously renovated kitchen, and a good amount of closet space. There were just a few features I wanted to update before I moved in: the bathroom was old and hadn’t been touched in at least a decade, and I wasn’t a fan of the original ‘70s parquet floors. I had also been dreaming for years of having enough bookshelf space in my apartment to hold all the books I want to accumulate and, of course, I had to have a walk-in closet.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">My contractor helped me design and create my dream floor-to-ceiling bookshelf and media center—an impressive 18 feet of bookshelf space.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I put in an offer that was accepted shortly before Thanksgiving, so I knew that the closing process might take a while given the upcoming holidays. Because of that lag, I was anxious to get the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation plans approved by the co-op board</a> prior to closing so that I could start construction as soon as closing occurred. I decided to work with architect Liz Mickey, AIA to help me visualize and design the new layout of the apartment, as well as draw up floor plans so I had something concrete I could submit to the co-op board. She gave me some great ideas, so by closing, I had a very solid idea of how I wanted the apartment to look before I moved in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40488 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>At that point, I hit a bit of a wall. Though I had a clear vision of the renovations I wanted, I was still very intimidated by the process of finding a general contractor, especially with the number of renovation horror stories I had heard from friends and just browsing online. I ended up coming across Sweeten through its blog while I was searching for both décor inspiration and renovation budget costs in the city. I decided to give it a shot and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M46pF7SpsME&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="question-to-sweeten-founder-image"  class="alignnone wp-image-40754 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-HiringGC.jpg" alt="image of a question to sweeten founder jean brownhill regarding hiring a general contractors" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-HiringGC.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-HiringGC-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-HiringGC-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The process of being matched with and choosing a contractor on Sweeten felt seamless—I found someone who understood what I was looking for and was eager to make my vision come to life. <span style="color: #333333;">The<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4407" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sweeten contractor I chose</a> helped me design and create my dream floor-to-ceiling bookshelf and media center, which spanned the entire length of the dining and living room wall—an impressive 18 feet of bookshelf space</span>, which I expect I won’t be able to fill for many years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40483" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06.jpg" alt="closet leading into bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40485 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-08.gif" alt="bedroom vanity" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Between the bedroom and the bathroom, a dingy closet space was converted into a walk-through closet with pocket doors to help save space and make sure the small bathroom didn’t feel cluttered. Since all the fixtures in the bathroom looked quite old, I decided on a gut renovation of the bathroom with new tile and a much larger and brighter mirror and lighting fixture. The only minor hiccup came when my super informed me I wouldn’t be able to replace the old cast-iron bathtub because of how it was connected to the downstairs apartment; we decided to just use a bathtub liner instead so the tub would be refreshed and feel as new as the rest of the bathroom.</p>

<p>I was especially glad I found a contractor I could trust because I had actually preplanned a three-week long vacation overseas before I knew I was going to be in the middle of renovations (and ended up breaking my phone two days in!). I was a bit nervous leaving right in the middle of all of the construction, but my Sweeten contractor gave me a lot of confidence that the project could proceed without me. So I picked out all of the finishes I wanted, ordered the fixtures, packed my bags and left right in the middle of the project. Sure enough, by the time I got back, the job was nearly complete!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40491 size-full" title="cat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg" alt="cat" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>I almost can’t believe how easy the process was, especially being able to leave for such a long time and come back to a nearly finished apartment, which was everything that I had hoped for. I moved in just a couple of weeks after I came back from vacation, and have had so much fun continuing to decorate the space and make it my own. It really is everything that I hoped for in my first apartment!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>
