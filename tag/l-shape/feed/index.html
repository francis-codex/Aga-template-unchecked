										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">For expecting parents Tina and Fletcher, their Brooklyn duplex renovation provided a new nest for three</h2>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23535 mb-0 size-chrono" title="duplex renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>A hunt for more space led Tina Ladd and her husband, Fletcher, from a one-bedroom on Manhattan’s Upper West Side to a garden duplex in a Cobble Hill brownstone. As an architect, Tina was thrilled to be able to customize their new home but was up against an urgent deadline: the imminent birth of the couple’s first child. The transformation was so remarkable, we&#8217;re telling the story in two parts, starting with the parlor. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>Here’s part one of Tina’s vision for the family home—and how she went into labor on moving day! </i></span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Guest post by Tina in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Coming from a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, we were eager to upsize to a two-bedroom and create a home for our expanding family. We had been looking at listings up and down Manhattan and in a couple of Brooklyn neighborhoods before we found out we were expecting a baby. Four months into the pregnancy (and into intensifying nesting instincts), we went into contract on a duplex in a historic Brooklyn townhouse. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While we would have been happy with a turn-key apartment, we were both open to renovation work so I could exercise my skill set as an architect and design a more tailored home for our family. With the advantage of a network of design professionals and general construction knowledge, we knew we could take on an appropriately sized project. As we approached a fixed deadline—the due date—we eliminated any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work. This would not only cut down on a construction timeline, but it would also eliminate the lengthy review process of obtaining permits from the Department of Buildings and the Landmark Preservation Commission.</span></p>

<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2">As an architect, I didn’t want a cookie-cutter apartment; luckily, my husband, Fletcher, was supportive in my pursuit of something unique. </span>When we attended the open house for our apartment, we were drawn to the high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room. The sun-filled living space was located on the entry parlor level of the townhouse (about five feet above street level), with views directly out to the beautiful brownstone street. The bedrooms were located on the garden level, one floor below. While the 1,200 sq. ft, two-bedroom space checked many boxes on our list, we felt a few changes were needed to turn it into the home we were searching for. The living space was in good shape, and some of it was even recently renovated. However, the kitchen was small and closed-off. Unlike the parlor floor with tall ceilings, the lower, garden level had very low ceilings and felt like a basement. <span class="s2">The previous owners had added some modern touches, and while we both prefer the minimalist aesthetic in certain types of projects, we knew bringing back some familiar character would help make the historic apartment feel more inviting.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Due to the seller’s terms for a closing date, we were in contract for nearly three months, pushing a tighter deadline. In order to be sure we could hit the ground running with construction upon closing, we discussed major design decisions, and I completed drawings for our anticipated work before meeting with contractors, and ahead of our closing date. At first, we had planned to open the kitchen and re-tile the bathrooms. By the time we were meeting with contractors, our list expanded to include refinishing the floors, adding molding/casing, and replacing all the interior doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a></span> to find a contractor after seeing an ad during Open House NYC, my favorite Sunday morning TV show. We were matched with three general contractors and decided to move forward with the <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> who best understood our vision and could</span> help us strategically meet our goals. He laid out a six-week timeline—a more ambitious schedule than we had anticipated! To meet our budget, we chose to supply the materials and fixtures, taking advantage of my design industry discounts.</span></p>

<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Our first goal with the apartment was to create an open </span><span class="s4">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. The existing kitchen was separated from the living room by a floating, non-structural wall. By removing the wall and turning the corner with new cabinets, we could transform the space from a narrow galley-style kitchen to an open L- shape with an island.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">From the first time we saw the space, I envisioned a transitional-style kitchen with navy blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>. I considered both Ikea cabinets with custom fronts, as well as standard semi-custom options. In my first walk-through with the contractor, he suggested a custom cabinet maker that could execute my vision in a more cost-effective way than semi-custom options from a big-box store. Initially, custom cabinets were not in our budget. We were able to construct a kitchen perfectly fit for the space, maximizing storage vertically. We ended up choosing a shaker-style in Newburyport Blue. Simple, budget-friendly 2&#215;8 subway tile in white from Nemo Tile and white Frosty Carrina from Caesarstone allowed the color of the cabinets to really pop. We installed under-cabinet outlet strips and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a>, which added a level of sophistication.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The previous owners had installed top-of-the-line appliances—a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Wolf range, and stove. Because we chose to keep the appliances, we designed around them. This was one advantage of a totally custom kitchen. We wanted a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> for the Wolf range with higher CFM (cubic feet per minute &#8211; a measure of the volume of air that moves heat, odor, moisture, and smoke per minute while cooking) capabilities than a typical over-the-range microwave venting system. The kitchen design didn’t really allow for an alternate microwave location, so we concealed it behind pocket doors in the island. The Sub-Zero refrigerator also impacted our design. The refrigerator door opened away from the cook and prep space in our new layout. Since the Sub-Zero design does not accommodate switching the door hinge side, the island footprint was rotated and narrowed from what we had originally planned in order to provide comfortable clearance.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing powder room design was very modern. To bring a more transitional feel marrying both traditional and contemporary elements into the bath, we replaced the tile, vanity mirrors and light fixtures for a more classic aesthetic. For the flooring, we chose Nemo’s Fluid basketweave marble mosaic; I love this pattern that was so common in prewar homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we got to work on the master bath and bedrooms which are located in the semi-subterranean lower level—and with shorter ceilings. Making the space brighter and restoring historic charm was the goal.</p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Integrated kitchen design, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span>An integrated kitchen refers to a kitchen design in which components and appliances are integrated seamlessly into the overall design of the space. This type of kitchen often has a sleek and modern appearance, with clean lines and a cohesive look. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>The aim of an integrated kitchen is to create a functional and stylish space that is easy to use and maintain. </span>Sweeten looks into this system called the integrated kitchen, sometimes referred to as a concealed kitchen. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you shop, develop a plan for this specific cabinetry system. Any floor plan, from galley and L-shape to U-shape and open-concept can work. However, only certain appliance styles can be accommodated. F</span><span class="s1">loor-to-ceiling cabinetry lined up seamlessly can hide as much clutter as possible in an open-concept plan. </span></p>
<h4>Colors for an integrated kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Choose a color and material scheme that is tonal, with smooth surfaces. The different areas blend into each other or at least transition quietly to create a harmonious living space.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you do have room for a dining table, try a banquette on the wall or in a corner if it’s available. Limiting the number of chairs will enhance the minimal effect and deemphasize a &#8220;kitchen&#8221; feel.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Panels help hide appliances in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To some extent, appliances cannot be hidden completely, but certain features make them less noticeable. Consider the refrigerator. Counter-depth versions that are “panel ready” are available from a vast range of companies, including Sub-Zero, GE, Frigidaire, and KitchenAid. Replace the enamel or stainless steel front with a panel kit from your cabinet supplier, and the fridge, which no longer juts past the countertop, will almost disappear. Note that counter-depth fridges come as side-by-sides or top- or bottom-mounts, but they won’t have quite the cubic foot capacity of the freestanding or built-in models. In fact, they may be limited by as much as 2 to 5 cubic feet and up. If you have the room, you could add a refrigerator or freezer drawer that tucks discreetly under the counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Many dishwashers can also be fitted with a matching panel, or opt for an “architectural” version like those offered by manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Miele, which have controls concealed on the inside top of the door. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Panels can’t disguise stoves, cooktops, and ovens, but you can make choices that make these indispensable appliances less prominent. Go for induction cooktops that use a smooth, single surface with the heating elements concealed underneath. Digital controls (instead of knobs) also disappear when not in use. As for the vent hood, if you have a cooktop, you can get a downdraft that sits below the counter and pops up only when in use.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Seamless kitchen cabinets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As the feature that typically takes up the most real estate in the kitchen, cabinets make or break the concealed look. European-style units open with gentle pressure applied to the outside of the door, making them a sensible choice for function and style. And hydraulic hinges on upper cabinets cause the doors to lift up and away with next to no effort. This type of sophistication comes at a price, however, so you might consider frameless doors and drawers, which completely cover the cabinet box, to suggest a seamless look. And where you can, take the cabinets up to the ceiling, to visually expand the appearance of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you commit, research whether matching panels are available to fit your fridge and dishwasher. Your contractor can replace the existing panels easily. If you must add hardware, choose handles molded from one piece of metal, or doors and drawers that come with built-in channels that you can grab and pull.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Add outlets to the inside of some cabinets to create small appliance garages, with sturdy hinges that can raise heavy tools like mixers up and out.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Staging a sink in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The sink will never disappear. However, if you choose an undermount sink, it will be less noticeable. An alternative: an integrated solid surface sink and countertop—virtually seam-free! The deeper the sink, the better it hides dirty dishes, of course. Some come with a cutting board accessory that tops the sink and creates an unbroken run of the countertop. Pair the sink with a touchless faucet for fewer visible details.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Concealing electrical outlets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you use any small appliances or electronics in the kitchen (who doesn’t?), outlets are unavoidable. Minimize their appearance by choosing outlets that match the material or wall color—like with Lutron. When that isn&#8217;t possible, try grouping switches and outlets together to diminish their overall presence. Another strategy: tuck an outlet under an overhang of a countertop, or low on a wall near the top of the counter, where it can hardly be noticed.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Minimize obvious task lighting </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the easiest feature to conceal, lighting nevertheless deserves a little design attention. Use cans in the ceiling for ambient light, and hide those task lights by using LED strips below your upper cabinets. Do have some fun, however, with pendants over the sink or island and a chandelier above the dining table. This is the place to introduce some wit and individual style—essential ingredients for any successful room.</span></p>
