			<h2>Combining two apartments is never easy. See how these families combined spaces.</h2>
<p>Combining two apartments into one home is one of the most time-consuming (and rewarding!) projects in the renovation world. The reason behind the decision varies, but the need is usually the same&#8230; more space. These renovators approached us looking to find vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors who could <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merge apartment units</a> to fit their changing lifestyles. Learn more from these NYC apartment combination examples below.</p>

<h3>1. Building a peaceful city oasis</h3>
<p>When this homeowner’s search for a three-bedroom apartment ended in disappointment, he decided to go in another direction. He bought two apartments in an Upper West Side co-op building after consulting the building’s management and an architect, with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan to combine them</a>. Both units were located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p>Working with his architect and the Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> he hired, he decided to merge them together through their kitchens and replace them with an open kitchen. He also expanded the primary bedroom and bathroom, creating a mini spa with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>.</p>
<p>A few bumps came up during the project; converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes in order to meet code and when trying to designate an entryway, they realized the configuration just wasn’t working. He ended up buying additional square footage from the hallway to create a more inviting one. Construction took a total of six months of work. The time, effort, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation costs</a> were well worth it. The homeowner said the apartment, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<h3>2. Up against a wall</h3>
<p>Zoe had long dreamt of buying and combining apartments, so when she and her husband Arvid felt they had officially <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outgrown their 700-square-foot one-bedroom</a> in Lincoln Square, Manhattan, they took matters into their own hands. After sending letters to neighbors, they learned one was looking to move, and the couple bought their apartment.</p>
<p>The goal was to remove the two existing kitchens and replace them with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern cook space</a>, plus rip out floors, and create a third bedroom. They learned knocking down walls certainly doesn’t come without challenges. Their contractor came across an unmovable gas riser in a wall they had planned to take down to open up the dining area. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor assessed the options</a> and had a solution: Make it part of the architecture by designing a partition (pictured above) and creating a dining nook. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36557 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Combining two apartments gave this couple a spacious kitchen a room to grow their family in the city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label">(Above) Megan and Zak&#8217;s apartment combination in Manhattan</span></p>
<h3>3. Building one modern, family home</h3>
<p>When Megan and Zak bought a one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan, they hoped the space would work for them and maybe a baby down the line. A year after living in their space, not only did they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realize it needed to be renovated</a>, but also that the apartment really wasn’t big enough for another human (even a tiny one). Luck was on their side as an apartment next door was available.</p>
<p>Once they finalized the sale, the couple started planning to combine the two apartments into one modern, family home. The biggest changes in the overall floorplan included eliminating one kitchen and converting a living room into a primary bathroom. The rest of the renovation focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating an open concept kitchen</a> and living area.</p>
<p>While they did run into a few issues (like discovering pipes in a wall that needed to be rerouted), overall their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation experience went smoothly</a>. “Keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There’s a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family,” Megan shared.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you do when you need more room? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can head for the suburbs, search for a larger apartment elsewhere, or if you’re lucky, scoop up an adjacent apartment and hold onto everything you love about your current neighborhood. Another popular approach is combining apartments which entail a search in areas with large inventories of smaller apartments. Below, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e outline how to combine apartments in NYC, pros and cons of this process, and take an in-depth look at budgeting. You can also read examples of homeowners who’ve been through the process with their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors.</span><br />

<h3>The pros and cons of combining apartments in NYC</h3>
<h4><b>Reasons to combine New York City apartments</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You stay in the same building and neighborhood, with access to all the same amenities, schools, services, and parks you love.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be more cost-effective (though still expensive) to buy an additional smaller unit and pay for a renovation than to buy a new, larger unit.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re already knowledgeable about the building. And if you’re on good terms with your board and superintendent, it may be easier to arrange the bureaucratic and logistical intricacies of a renovation than if you’re the new kid on the block.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re on good terms with your neighbors who will stay good neighbors—even through the construction noise.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be able to avoid broker fees when staying in the same building and buying directly.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reasons not to combine apartments</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re limited to the immediately adjacent units, the abutting spaces may not be conducive to a smooth flow, depending on layout restrictions. You might end up with awkward hallways or bedrooms off the kitchen.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board might be unhappy to have too high a percentage of ownership concentrated in one person’s hands, and in turn, prove difficult about the approval process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will take on additional maintenance and taxes, and the combined charges may appear unusually high to potential buyers for resale.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, you will have to pay the carrying costs on both apartments for the duration of the renovation (possibly without being able to live in either!).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to merge two apartments in a new location, you’ll face the same cons, as well as the need to finance two home purchases.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Should you combine apartments? Ask yourself these questions.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners with adjacent apartments have the luxury of multiple layout options, but also need to work within a unique set of constraints to create the new space. In any unit-combining project, you’ll have to consider the following questions:</span></p>
<p><b>Is a combination even possible?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all buildings allow combinations. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check the building&#8217;s alteration agreement</a> for allowances. And in those that do, before you buy, bring in an architect and/or structural engineer to assess whether your dream can be made a reality. Don’t assume that you can knock down that wall! As one Sweeten contractor points out: “Your ability to probe for structural elements prior to construction can be limited by building requirements and existing tenants, and building records are notorious for omitting elements of the building’s composition, so you have to work with your architect to prepare for unforeseen conditions.” Although there is a limit to what can be deduced without actually starting demolition, a consultation will give you a sense of what you can do and how much it’ll cost.</span></p>
<p><b>Are you combining horizontally or vertically?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Horizontal combinations are typically easier, because it can be as simple as knocking through a non-structural wall to make a door-sized opening and removing one kitchen (NYC code only permits one kitchen per apartment, although certain exceptions can be made).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical combinations (duplexes) are more complicated because of structural considerations and the possibility of electrical and plumbing systems hidden in floors. And don’t forget the staircase! It can take up more space than anticipated and require the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring of a few renovation experts</a> (architect, structural engineer, contractor, millworker) to design, approve, fabricate, and install.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners, Zoe and Arvid,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed a horizontal combination in Lincoln Square. Their scope included removing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the two existing kitchens, ripping out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and taking down internal walls to create a third bedroom.</span></p>

<p><b>Can you use the space intelligently and create an overall flow?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Buildings often limit where you can move baths and kitchens with “no wet-over-dry” rules, preferring that wet rooms remain stacked on top of each other from floor to floor (to curtail damage from any potential leaks and preserve plumbing lines). If that’s the case, you may not get be able to rethink the layout. That said, it’s certainly not impossible. One </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-apartment-combination-with-a-view/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten renovator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Upper West Side expanded his bathroom by taking space from a nearby closet. Wiring did have to be moved, but he was able to complete and get the project approved accordingly.</span></p>

<p><strong>How</strong><b> will you merge the heating and cooling systems? </b>Especially in older buildings, units may not share the same type of systems. You may consider installing an entirely new system across the new space.</p>
<p><b>Are the apartments in similar condition, and are the floors and ceilings level? </b>If the two units were updated at different times, they might not share the same flooring, trim, moldings, doors, or hardware. Apartments in older buildings are sometimes unleveled. Many creative solutions are available, such as sunken living rooms or coffered ceilings, but it’s best to consult an architect on what will work best in your space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Megan and Zak</a> bought an apartment next door to their own in their Carnegie Hill neighborhood. Their original space was updated (but not to their tastes) while the other was incredibly outdated. “Combining both of them would allow us to rethink the space to suit our needs and lifestyle,” they shared. For this complex project, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found three Sweeten contractors in Manhattan</a> they were impressed with.</p>

<h3>Combining Apartments in NYC: Building and City Requirements</h3>
<p>A renovation is always a learning process, and doubly so when it’s an apartment combination project. You’re typically allowed to merge units in either co-ops or condos, but different approvals and filings are associated with each. In both, however, you’ll have to deal with requirements from the building as well as the city.</p>
<h4>Building requirements for combining apartments</h4>
<p>Get in touch with management to make sure that you have a comprehensive list of all the building requirements. Most buildings will also require architectural plans first to be submitted to the board for approval. Some will have template alteration agreements in place, which can be adapted to your specific project. These will have details about permissible work hours, protection of common areas, whether there are “wet-over-dry” rules, as well as information about the costs associated with approvals, security deposits, and other building fees.</p>
<h4>City requirements for combining apartments</h4>
<p>A myriad of codes govern apartment combinations, and New York City has put together <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/code_notes_combining_apt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources to guide homeowners through the process</a>. Still, you’ll probably want to hire an expediter to help you navigate the process. Unlike simpler renovations, joining units will most certainly require permits from the Department of Buildings (DoB). For example, you’ll need an ALT2 (Alteration Type 2) application for a permit to remove a kitchen, which involves cutting and capping all gas and electrical lines. For condos, you will also need to merge the tax lots on the two properties by filing an amendment to the condo declaration and offering a plan with the Department of Finance (DoF).</p>
<p>A final note on approvals: homeowners tell us hold-ups usually occur in the building approval process, rather than with the city. This is because boards can make decisions “as they see fit,” leading to inexplicable delays, whereas the city permits process is well-regulated and navigable by an experienced professional, such as an expediter.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>What to Expect When Combining Apartments</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the various moving parts of an apartment combination, allow for extra time and budget.  Give yourself a few months of wiggle room—if your general contractor says that the project will take six months, plan for it to take eight or nine. Your contractor should be able to tell you at the outset of your project whether it would be advisable or possible for you to stay put. If you need to relocate, rent space nearby for at least that amount of time so that you’ll have a debris-free home that’s close enough to the construction site for frequent check-ins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the process, just remember the prize: a beautiful, sprawling apartment customized just for you and your family to enjoy for years to come.</span></p>
<h3>Costs for Combining Apartments in NYC</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with other renovation projects, understanding the scope of your project is the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first step to creating a budget</a>. While apartment combination projects usually run in the six figures, let’s start with a baseline scenario for a </span><b>horizontal combination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for budgeting purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers should be considered a minimum; most combinations will cost more.  If your project is a vertical one, there will be significant additional costs due to the necessity of a structural engineer and relevant permits. A vertical scope would be outside the baseline scenario outlined below.</span></p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong><b> Initial consultation<br />
</b>You walk through the space with a pro, who will tell you whether a combination is possible and/or advisable. This will take about two to five hours, including a follow-up consultation.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect and/or structural engineer<br />
</span><b>Estimated cost: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay for any renderings or designer work they do (see costs below)</span></p>
<p><strong>2.) </strong><b> Architectural drawings and schematic design<br />
</b>An architect will draw up renderings, which will be used to obtain building and city approvals. If you hire an interior designer to draw them, they’ll need to be stamped by a registered architect to be approved through a board and the DOB.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b> Architect and/or interior designer<br />
<b>Estimated cost:</b> $500-$1,500, approximately 10% of the architect’s fee</p>
<p><b>3.) Architect’s fee<br />
</b>Includes field measuring, schematic design, project management (including the work of filing and building/city approvals), and periodic on-site check-ins to make sure all is going to plan. overseeing the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect<br />
</span><b>Estimated cost:</b> Typically 10-20% of the total project cost</p>
<p><b>4.) Building approvals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building boards will often ask for fees upfront to pay their experts to review the plans, and for security deposits, shut-off fees, general construction charges, and penalty fees.</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b>An architect<br />
<b>Estimated costs: </b>Dependant on the percentage of the project and individual building requirements. This is something homeowners can handle themselves to help cut costs.</p>
<p><b>5.) City permits and requirements<br />
</b>You’ll need to meet various requirements and obtain relevant permits. An expediter will speed up the process.</p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b> Architect, expediter, or project manager<br />
<b>Estimated costs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Asbestos inspection: $500</li>
<li>Plumbing permit: up to $2,000</li>
<li>Electrical permit: $900</li>
<li>ALT2 permit: dependant on the size of the project; a few hundred to a few thousand dollars</li>
<li>Expediter: $3,500 per project</li>
<li>Filing/recording fees: $3,000-$5,000</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b><b>6.) Monthly carrying costs</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to pay the taxes and common charges on both apartments while the renovation is ongoing. Allot time not just for the actual construction, but also obtaining permits and approvals.</span></p>
<p><b>Estimated costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sums of carrying costs of each apartment</span></p>
<p><b>7.) Labor/contracting work</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with your general contractor</a>, their role is similar to other renovations: basic prep work, demolition, plumbing and electrical, building/installation, clean-up and completion. The contractor will also need to ensure uniformity across spaces by replacing baseboards, molding, hardware, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractor<br />
</span><b>Estimated costs: </b>$80,000-$100,000</p>
<p><b>8.) Materials</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sourcing paint, doorknobs, hinges, and other finishes</span></p>
<p><b>Who’s involved:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contractor, architect/designer, or project manager<br />
</span><b>Estimated costs: </b>$100-$1,000</p>
<p><b>9.) Contingency</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always budget for unexpected expenses. This is especially true in renovations where there are structural changes or if you’re removing walls, floors, and ceilings.</span></p>
<p><b>Estimated costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1,500-$2,000, or roughly 10-20% of the total project cost</span></p>
<p><b>10.) Miscellaneous</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip for workers, gifts for neighbors for putting up with disruption from construction, and other small expenses.</span></p>
<p><b>Estimated cost: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100-$200</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, these budget estimates are a starting point. It is likely your apartment combination will include further upgrades. This can include extensive layout changes, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs for a kitchen</a> revamped or relocated, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs for bathrooms</a> added or updated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new HVAC system, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs for creating built-ins</a>. And if you are installing a new air system, you may need to consult a mechanical engineer. </span></p>
<h3>Getting Back What You Put Into an Apartment Combination</h3>
<p>In new developments, sponsors have offered to combine units, while real estate agents marketing combination units will include architectural drawings and other resources needed for such a project. In many neighborhoods, especially those with kid-friendly amenities and good public schools, creating a larger apartment can be a sound financial investment. Each situation is different, however, so be sure to take the following into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it make sense for your family’s needs?</li>
<li>How much are the monthly carrying charges (maintenance and taxes)—will they be affordable for you and for any potential buyers down the line?</li>
<li>Can you obtain financing for the renovation?</li>
<li>For resale purposes, what is the estimated market value of the combined unit, versus the two units separately?</li>
</ul>
