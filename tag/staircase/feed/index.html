<h3>Elevating the best aspects of home</h3>
<p class="p8">We have been living in this apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2015. It was the first place we lived together, and it felt like a real 1980s loft, which Sue and I liked a lot. The previous owner was crafty—he’d installed his own kitchen cabinets, and the spirit of the place was very DIY. Sue works in Fin-tech and I am in interior design. We didn’t do much work when we first moved in, thinking it made sense to let the apartment evolve.</p>

<p>The apartment comprises approximately 900 square feet. It had many vantage points, which our cat, who recently passed, really enjoyed. The neighborhood seems to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of industrial building conversions</a>—a church here, a school there, made into residential apartments. Our building belongs to the latter group, and was converted more than 30 years ago. Visitors are often amazed at how wide the hallways are. That sort of space is not something you often encounter in NYC.</p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Honing in on the shared lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Looking to build on the apartment’s openness, we made a few changes early on. One was removing a spiral staircase and replacing it with an industrial-use stair; it remains in the same location in the current iteration. Another was taking out an idiosyncratic shelving system that the previous owner had installed. We are both utilitarian, and that aspect of our personalities influences our aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-staircase-leading-to-loft" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg" alt="View of the black staircase leading to loft along with dining area and kitchen after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50882" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-with-open-shelving" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Dining area with open shelving unit overlooking the black staircase leading to the loft after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also like this word that the Dutch have, <i>Gezellig,</i> which translates to something like coziness. It’s not a style, per se, but achieving it was a driving force for our renovation. We didn’t want an overly designed space, but rather one that felt <i>considered.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Practical launch pad to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated our renovation</a> to coincide with the water boiler warranty expiration. Each unit has its own boiler, and you always hear about these things failing shortly after their warranty goes. We figured we would try to avoid becoming a statistic. Another <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation to upgrade</a> was the desperate need for an electrical panel overhaul in the apartment. </span><span class="s1">We wanted to add an in-unit washer and dryer and a shower to our powder room. In addition, the apartment lacked, and desperately needed, built-in storage. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We posted our project, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> was a great help in providing a list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant contractors in Brooklyn</a>. Since I work in this field, I did not utilize other services the company provides. I wanted to complete the renovation within an allotted time frame, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep within a firm budget</a>. Our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor proposed great ideas</a>. We had a few conversations before the renovation, and she was very accommodating. </span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Design tricks-of-the-trade</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is always exciting to see a project on paper come to life, but it is especially interesting when you have an experimental client—in this case, ha!, ourselves. Our contractor convinced me that we should open up the entry foyer, which I wasn’t sure of. But in the end I think sacrificing the extra storage was worth it to expand the passageway. We also separated the passthrough between the dining and living space with an oversized barn door, which disappears when retracted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We employed other tricks as well. Take the painting and color scheme, for example. We applied a World War I ship-camouflage technique known as Dazzle—which was a way of masking the volume and shape of military ships using geometric patterns—to try to make walls and objects more or less vanish into the space. We used black behind the TV to have it blend into the space. It is also a nod to the blackboard that would have hung on the wall in this former classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stayed with a pretty strict material palette just because it is easier to manage and is also a fun challenge to stretch the limit of the material. For example, the black countertop and black backsplash is actually a paper-based product that is extremely durable. I also used it as treads for the stairs.</span></p>

<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Being flexible during the process</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter how simple you aim to keep it, in any construction project, there will be challenges to overcome. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out of the apartment</a> during the renovation, but I went to the job site every other day to make sure we were moving forward. During one visit, I noticed that the contracting team had framed one of the walls in the wrong location. Instead of losing time having the contractor demolish the framing and restart, however, I decided to redesign that portion of the space. I did it overnight. In the end, we were able to salvage the work and it turned out nicely. It felt serendipitous. </span></p>

<h3>Setting goals for a new home</h3>
<p>We bought this house with dreams of a live/work space that would reflect our style and offer plenty of room for our art collection. Steve is a painter, so having his studio at home was a life-long dream. We also wanted a place where our friends and large extended family could come together.</p>

<p>We are Steve DeFrank and Lewis Holman. Steve teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Lewis is self-employed as a tax accountant. We sold our loft condo in Williamsburg after living in it for nearly 15 years to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a small townhouse</a> in the South Bronx.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>From a two-family to a single-family rowhouse</h3>
<p>The engineer&#8217;s report on our 1882 rowhouse in Mott Haven, the Bronx, looked good, but we still wanted a gut renovation. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure has three stories</a> comprising roughly 1,500 square feet. The home had been divided into two apartments and had eight rooms on two of the floors. We wanted to renovate and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to a single-family home</a> to accommodate a live/work situation.</p>

<p>We listed our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/bronx-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build services in the Bronx</a>. Sweeten’s introduction to our Bronx contractor and architect was a valuable service. As first-time renovators, our biggest question before starting was how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhauling the home would cost</a>. the project were about cost. In addition to an in-home studio, we wanted to open up every floor of the building, giving us fewer walls and more windows. We understood that altering the building in this way would be an investment.</p>
<p>The plan we made with the architect was for the ground floor to be Steve’s studio and a water closet—a bathroom with the sink outside. The middle floor would be the living and dining rooms, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a customized kitchen</a> and a half bath. On the top floor would be our bedroom and a home office/guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remodeled full bath</a>, and a laundry closet.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for a true gut renovation</a>—nothing was in good enough shape to retain. Our Sweeten contractors demolished down to the bricks and joists, all of which had to be replaced or sistered; this was necessary to allow removal of the central beam, which had to be done to open up the ground- and middle-floor spaces.</p>
<h3>Radiant heat and functional stairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the home, we aimed for low-maintenance, design-worthy materials to evoke an aesthetic of warm minimalism. We wanted expansive wall space for hanging artwork. The ground-level studio interior is an open workspace with recessed LED lighting, a lot of artist’s storage, and radiant-heat flooring—which we installed on all levels. To bring as much light as possible to the studio, we opened the rear wall with an 8’ x 9’ three-panel glass sliding door.</p>
<p>We decided to remove the original front stoop and relocate the house’s entrance to the ground floor, which created some challenges. Our architect Shannon envisioned—and our Sweeten contractor produced—a storage unit that divides the entry area from the studio space. We had hoped to save the original interior staircase and railing, but our Sweeten contractor showed us options that made more sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we closed the stairs from the ground floor to the first to create more wall space in the studio; we chose a vivid pink hue for the risers, which brightens the whole entrance. On the parlor and top floors, we went with a wood stair-rail that looks simultaneously classic and modern. In the end, we were very happy that we took our contractor’s advice.</p>

<h3>Connecting all of the floors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for the kitchen</a> included custom millwork with the front panels painted green evoking the palest verdigris. Our island, which has an angled front, is an homage to artist Donald Judd. We rented nearby during renovations and observed this living area coming together. Visiting the site at least twice a week, we loved seeing the gradual progress, sometimes glacial and sometimes lightning quick.</p>

<p>A dining-area drawer and shelving system provides storage and connects these rooms to the top floor, where the main bedroom and home office also employ coordinating storage units. We had fun with tile to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize the full bath</a> upstairs, where we mixed matte and glossy tile in a range of sizes and colors, including chartreuse, dark green, and gray-green.</p>
<h3>A building exterior refresh</h3>
<p>The elimination of the parlor-floor entrance led to an anomaly on the front of the house, with regards to the living-room windows. The window occupying the old door frame is much larger than the window next to it. The architect’s solution—a modular window design, made up of a series of smaller frames, one of which mirrors the smaller window to create a visual connection.</p>

<h3>Steve and Lewis’ renovation advice</h3>
<p>Throughout the job, we enjoyed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborative exchange with our contractor</a> and architect. As first-time (and last!) renovators, we’d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen the right team</a> carefully. Our contractor and crew kept a sense of humor during a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>Our advice to other <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners ready for a renovation</a>: Anticipate bad news and delays, and roll with the punches. Be grateful for the opportunity you have, even when you wonder why you ever thought it was a good idea! And remember, issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in. Now when we enter our home, we feel serene.</p>

			<h2>Once-scary staircases that are now part of beautiful spaces, thanks to a Sweeten renovation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When most people think about renovation, they immediately envision <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/before-after/bathrooms/">bathrooms</a> being gutted and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/before-after/kitchens/">kitchens</a> being ripped out and replaced. Of course, these are amazing transformations that really make a great impact on our homes, but other less celebrated areas also add an interesting design element to the overall aesthetic of the space. Below, a roundup of Sweeten renovations that feature some stylish staircases.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42357 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the homeowners stepped into this <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/">Manhattan loft</a> they were taken by the high ceilings and 10-foot windows that looked out over a verdant courtyard. They ended up renovating the kitchen and master bedroom to match the vibe of the space, which features statement-making floating steps—an ode to the 1929 industrial building in which the apartment is located.</p>

<p>This 1920s home in Midwood, Brooklyn, has <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great layout with the foyer</a>, living room, and dining room being pretty much open but still having their own distinct space. The second floor needed fixing up when the homeowners moved in. It was covered in wood paneling, lacked overhead lighting, and had carpeted stairs leading to it. They updated the latter with detailed molding and hardwood steps.</p>

<p>As parents of young children, the homeowners of this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/renovating-a-brooklyn-duplex-in-time-for-the-baby-naming-party/">duplex in Brooklyn</a> wanted a staircase that was safe for the kids but still had a modern design aesthetic. They updated the stairway by adding a new banister with a closed glass barrier and installing backing between the treads and the open stairs.</p>

<p>You can imagine that in a home with three levels, the staircases would be important design features. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/triplex-renovation-greenwich-village/">apartment</a> in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village is no exception. The homeowner wanted to “open up the space,” which is not an easy feat in a triplex, but the see-through staircases were a good start.</p>

<p>The Jersey City couple took their time when they moved into their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/">new duplex</a> and did just cosmetic changes at first. But two years later, they were ready to turn the two-family house into a single home. One important “step&#8221; was to redesign the entryway and expose the existing staircase, which was behind a wall so they didn’t have to go through the foyer to access the upstairs level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25529 size-full" title="wooden staircase" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the homeowners first moved in, this brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, was basically uninhabitable. It needed a lot of work! But with the help of their Sweeten architect, they were able to update the home so that it <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pays homage to its historic roots</a>, with beautiful hardwoods, moldings, and detailing. The grand staircase greets people as they enter,  and is made even more striking by its black color and the landing at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28.jpg" alt="Blue closed coat closet with pink staircase and green coat hangers" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50810" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Steve-RowHouse-After28-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Evaluating your stair needs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your remodel involves a staircase from a 1780 Philadelphia trinity, a colonial rowhouse, or a suburban home from the 1980s, chances are the staircase you currently have won’t meet today’s building codes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that building around and refurbishing what you have may well be the most efficient on the budget, design, and logistics of your project. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, safety and modernization may require the creation of a new set of stairs. </span>Read about codes, structural work, permits, and refurbishing vs. new builds for a staircase remodel in Philadephia with advice from <a href="https://sweeten.com/pa/philadelphia-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local Sweeten general contractors</a>.</p>
<h3><b>What do building codes say about new staircases?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the older the building is, the steeper the staircase will be. Staircases built before the 1950s often have a tread of about nine inches with a nine-inch rise. As a result, the vertical and horizontal pieces are evenly sized. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/li/codesandregulations/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Code Council</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(used by the City of Philadelphia and many surrounding municipalities) now calls for more tread and less height: requiring a 10.5-inch tread with a maximum rise of 7.75 inches. The code also requires a minimum width of 36 inches, expanding older conventions where a staircase might be as slim as 26 inches. The trick here is that old construction is grandfathered in and doesn’t run afoul of the code, unless you decide to replace what’s there.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1">Winder stairs code</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staircases that wind around corners can also be problematic. In its </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20190521124726/Philadelphia_Rowhouse_Manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historical guide to rowhouses</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the City’s planning commission refers to these as “winders,” where stairs spiral out from a single point. Because of poor safety—walking down is difficult—adding “winders” is now illegal in major renovations and new construction. So, you can keep any existing, older winder staircases; but replacing them brings new requirements that might be challenging to fit in the house’s dimensions. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How a new staircase can affect your floor plan</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to replace a staircase, you must meet current codes. In older homes, this causes problems. As the code calls for a longer tread and a lower rise, a new staircase typically needs to be longer to reach between floors, and will overshoot the current length. In homes with a small footprint, new staircase dimensions can end up awkwardly jutting out against a wall or door. In some cases, you can add a slight turn to the new staircase design to minimize length. Additionally, you may be able to elevate some of the overhead floor to accommodate the additional length, but in many cases, refurbishing what you have will be the least invasive solution.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Structural work and permits needed for a new staircase build</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constructing a new staircase requires building permits and your plans will also need the approval of a structural engineer or a registered architect. Prepare yourself for electrical and plumbing implications (and permits) if your designs involve layout or structural changes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many older staircases are typically walled-in on one or both sides. With current housing trends calling for an open plan, most homeowners want to open up at least one side of a staircase, either partially or in full. These walls on the side of the stairs are usually always load-bearing and therefore structural. Building <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/renovating-philadelphia-heres-need-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits and approvals in Philadelphia</a> by either a structural engineer or a registered architect will be required.</span></p>
<h4>Reasons to build a new staircase</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety and accessibility are the biggest reasons to bring in a new staircase. Consider treads that cannot fit a whole foot, steep rises between stairs, a winding path, and a slim fit between wall and railing. These aspects aren’t easy to navigate and can affect use for people of all ages.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to renovate an existing staircase</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Updating the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/trinity-home-renovation-philadelphia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aesthetics of an existing staircase</a> will be less invasive and probably won’t need building permits. There are ways to refurbish a staircase without changing the structure. “Replace the treads, risers, or railing” if you’re looking for an update, advises Philadelphia-based <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Kenny. “If you keep the existing opening through the floor above, you’ll avoid the requirement for a code-compliant stair, which might not fit in your home.” You can also update the stringers (which support the treads) by adding material to strengthen or enhance them, he continued.</p>
<p class="p1">Other changes to consider include adding or removing carpeting; updating the banister style; changing the wood type over the staircase’s substructure; or laying down tile.</p>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor in Philadelphia for a staircase remodel</h3>
<p><span class="s1">It&#8217;s clear that remodeling a staircase in a home, especially a historic or older home, can be challenging. For example, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philly rowhouses vary in size but are typically small to moderately-sized with Trinities and Bandboxes coming in at 400 to 600 square feet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating a Philadelphia rowhouse</a> requires experienced contractors who understand the rules and codes for working in these types of structures. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post your project</a> and we&#8217;ll connect you with the right contractors.</span> </span></p>
