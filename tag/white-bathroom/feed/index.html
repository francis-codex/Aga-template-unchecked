<h3>Elevating the best aspects of home</h3>
<p class="p8">We have been living in this apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2015. It was the first place we lived together, and it felt like a real 1980s loft, which Sue and I liked a lot. The previous owner was crafty—he’d installed his own kitchen cabinets, and the spirit of the place was very DIY. Sue works in Fin-tech and I am in interior design. We didn’t do much work when we first moved in, thinking it made sense to let the apartment evolve.</p>

<p>The apartment comprises approximately 900 square feet. It had many vantage points, which our cat, who recently passed, really enjoyed. The neighborhood seems to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of industrial building conversions</a>—a church here, a school there, made into residential apartments. Our building belongs to the latter group, and was converted more than 30 years ago. Visitors are often amazed at how wide the hallways are. That sort of space is not something you often encounter in NYC.</p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Honing in on the shared lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Looking to build on the apartment’s openness, we made a few changes early on. One was removing a spiral staircase and replacing it with an industrial-use stair; it remains in the same location in the current iteration. Another was taking out an idiosyncratic shelving system that the previous owner had installed. We are both utilitarian, and that aspect of our personalities influences our aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-staircase-leading-to-loft" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg" alt="View of the black staircase leading to loft along with dining area and kitchen after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50882" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-with-open-shelving" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Dining area with open shelving unit overlooking the black staircase leading to the loft after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also like this word that the Dutch have, <i>Gezellig,</i> which translates to something like coziness. It’s not a style, per se, but achieving it was a driving force for our renovation. We didn’t want an overly designed space, but rather one that felt <i>considered.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Practical launch pad to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated our renovation</a> to coincide with the water boiler warranty expiration. Each unit has its own boiler, and you always hear about these things failing shortly after their warranty goes. We figured we would try to avoid becoming a statistic. Another <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation to upgrade</a> was the desperate need for an electrical panel overhaul in the apartment. </span><span class="s1">We wanted to add an in-unit washer and dryer and a shower to our powder room. In addition, the apartment lacked, and desperately needed, built-in storage. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We posted our project, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> was a great help in providing a list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant contractors in Brooklyn</a>. Since I work in this field, I did not utilize other services the company provides. I wanted to complete the renovation within an allotted time frame, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep within a firm budget</a>. Our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor proposed great ideas</a>. We had a few conversations before the renovation, and she was very accommodating. </span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Design tricks-of-the-trade</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is always exciting to see a project on paper come to life, but it is especially interesting when you have an experimental client—in this case, ha!, ourselves. Our contractor convinced me that we should open up the entry foyer, which I wasn’t sure of. But in the end I think sacrificing the extra storage was worth it to expand the passageway. We also separated the passthrough between the dining and living space with an oversized barn door, which disappears when retracted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We employed other tricks as well. Take the painting and color scheme, for example. We applied a World War I ship-camouflage technique known as Dazzle—which was a way of masking the volume and shape of military ships using geometric patterns—to try to make walls and objects more or less vanish into the space. We used black behind the TV to have it blend into the space. It is also a nod to the blackboard that would have hung on the wall in this former classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stayed with a pretty strict material palette just because it is easier to manage and is also a fun challenge to stretch the limit of the material. For example, the black countertop and black backsplash is actually a paper-based product that is extremely durable. I also used it as treads for the stairs.</span></p>

<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Being flexible during the process</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter how simple you aim to keep it, in any construction project, there will be challenges to overcome. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out of the apartment</a> during the renovation, but I went to the job site every other day to make sure we were moving forward. During one visit, I noticed that the contracting team had framed one of the walls in the wrong location. Instead of losing time having the contractor demolish the framing and restart, however, I decided to redesign that portion of the space. I did it overnight. In the end, we were able to salvage the work and it turned out nicely. It felt serendipitous. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2005, a condo conversion gave Felix the opportunity to buy an apartment in the Williamsburg building where she had rented for three years. Although she considered renovating the spacious but “grim” rental-grade bathroom at the time, she procrastinated…for over a decade. It wasn’t until 2016 that she pulled the trigger, but the results were well worth the wait. With a bright new master bathroom, a brand new extra powder room, a washer/dryer closet, and an entryway closet, the project incorporated clean lines and Scandinavian-inspired design throughout the new spaces that blended seamlessly with the loft-style apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21113 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21076"></span>Fun fact: before moving into her current space, Felix lived in an identical apartment two stories above. She was one of the few residents who remained through the conversion, and as the 12-unit building emptied out, the sponsors told her that she could look around and have her pick of the lot. Felix chose to purchase on the third floor with the future in mind: although she didn’t yet have kids, she was hoping to, and a fifth-floor walkup with a baby sounded unrealistic. Given the nearly-empty building, she was also in the unique position of being able to slowly move all her belongings from one apartment to the other, placing her furniture in the exact same location—just two floors down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2015, Felix started thinking renovations again. She now had a daughter, Nova, and while the 1,500-square foot apartment provided plenty of space for the duo, the bathroom update was long overdue, and storage space in the entryway was lacking, so a new closet was also in order. A powder room would be a much-appreciated addition, given that they had room for guests and a third bedroom might be added down the line. Last—but certainly not least—Felix wanted to include a washer/dryer to the scope of her project. When a Google search led her to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you might be wondering why a whole year lapsed between Felix posting the project, and the project breaking ground. This is a story of perseverance paying off: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a>, who Felix chose from several Sweeten matches, patiently checked in with Felix over the course of the next dozen months as she updated and changed the details of the renovation. “We were laughing about it, because it was really just shy of a year of us meeting [for the first time] and me pulling the trigger,” Felix recalled. “That was really why I went with him—he stuck with me through the procrastination!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21094 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21092 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once Felix signed on the dotted line, things picked up pace. Alan was helpful in the planning stages by assisting her in decision-making about layout, materials, and finishes. She would send him links and he gave feedback about whether a choice might work. Felix and Alan also worked together to carve up what once was open, under-utilized space right outside of the original bathroom. They physically mapped out where walls would go for the new half-bath and closets, and worked with the building&#8217;s condo board and architect to review the plans and work through permit filing requirements. <span id="m_4274900948712308356gmail-m_-4912132230132608472m_-173239267599755632m_3764308559695335903m_-8103665152874927754m_-6452857499375953401m_-3861732466284412182gmail-m_1969148704937432351m_7319843981009065494gmail-m_-8045206210142907377gmail-docs-internal-guid-4a6a0646-b1cd-4c67-2385-bb691e742e01" class="gmail_msg"></span>Inside the existing full bath, they decided to keep both the sink and the toilet in the original location, but moved the tub slightly to make room for an extra linen closet behind the bathroom door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21114 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21115 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21116 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21117 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21124" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet.gif" alt="Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-linen-closet-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Felix’s original vision of a “Scandinavian feel” was brought to life through gray and white finishes with wood and colorful accents. In the full bath, Felix chose a gray slate tile for the floor, to contrast against the white bathtub, toilet, and vanity. For the walls, she chose a matte white subway tile from Nemo Tile, intending to lay it horizontally, but changed direction when she realized that the tile fit perfectly along the tub when laid vertically. A glass partition maintains the overall minimalist look. Alan’s team recessed a large mirrored medicine cabinet into the wall, providing ample storage. Felix also appreciated that the understated palette of the permanent fixtures meant that she could change out bright hooks and towels without having to worry about clashing colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, Felix carried through the same minimal design and materials, with wall-mounted fixtures that maximize floor space. Although the decision to wall-mount the toilet complemented the overall design, it was borne of necessity: during demo, Alan discovered that a steel beam ran through the floor where the toilet would have stood, making it impossible to run the necessary plumbing. He made use of his extensive network and had a different model delivered with minimal delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21091 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01-600x401.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21119 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08-723x1100.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1100" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21120 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21128 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif" alt="Sweeten-Felix-closet1" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The steel beam beneath the powder room was the only major obstacle in a process that otherwise went smoothly and quickly, with Felix and Nova displaced from their apartment for just under two months. Alan’s team cordoned off the renovation zone to keep dust from invading the rest of the apartment (see <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/8-ways-minimize-mess-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> on how to minimize mess during construction), and kept it tidy throughout the duration of the project. While construction was underway, Felix would stop by the work site daily to check in and to answer any questions the team had. “But pretty much Alan knew what I wanted,” Felix explained. (This may have had something to do with the fact that they had been talking about this project for 12 months!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Felix and Nova have moved back into the loft, they are thoroughly enjoying the updates. In particular, the stacked washer/dryer has been a “life changer,” and they now have space for coats as well as odds and ends like the vacuum cleaner in the new entryway closet. The baths provide a spa-like experience with plentiful storage, but remain beautifully simple. Felix loves her new space but does have a minor regret—she wishes that she had had the foresight to hang the medicine cabinet in the full bath a bit higher so that she could open the doors without knocking over bottles sitting on the back ledge of the sink. Overall, however, Felix found the renovation process to be “surprisingly easy,” even for a first-time renovator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to Felix and Nova for sharing their space—we’re so glad you decided to go for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, we have one of those before and afters that is a bit hard to believe at first look. Lee Hoffman, the CEO and founder of the photo-sharing app <a href="https://freefiregenerator.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memoir</a>, bought a 1+ bedroom, 1 bathroom co-op in Midtown East last year. The original kitchen and bathroom were beyond a little forlorn; the kitchen was hidden behind a walled entryway &#8211; more of a hallway than a room. This might have been initially helpful given its 1978 vintage, but not ideal in an apartment that depended on the kitchen window for extra light in the living room. And we can only assume that this bathroom had seen better days, right? Lee did months and months of research on ways to update the space and came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor who could give some serious attention to this unloved <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little kitchen and bath</a> pair. We sent <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> to handle things, envisioning some nice new cabinets and tile &#8211; the usual works. We definitely did not see this whole new look coming!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong><img decoding="async" title="pull-out-acrylic-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47812 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lee-MidtownEastKitchen.jpg" alt="white acrylic pull out kitchen cabinets and stainless steel appliances and gray flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lee-MidtownEastKitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lee-MidtownEastKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lee-MidtownEastKitchen-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Lee-MidtownEastKitchen-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />&#8220;Sweeten made the process super easy to get bids and ultimately find a great contractor. I&#8217;m really glad I found you guys.&#8221; </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8211; Lee Hoffman, Manhattan homeowner</strong></em><span id="more-13675"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While there is more than enough to see in these &#8220;before&#8221; photos, Lee found himself up against one major, invisible force: the co-op&#8217;s previous tenant had been a smoker and the original stock finishes were covered in smoky residue. The kitchen was virtually sealed off from the living room, and its big window was partially blocked by cabinetry and a fridge that had been wedged into the galley. Lee knew he could swap in new cabinets and appliances, but when he learned that the dividing wall was non-load-bearing, he began to picture taking down the wall to let light into the living room from two directions. He put together a lengthy list of big and small updates (wall demolition all the way down to soft-close cabinets) and took the same approach to bring light and modern appeal to the crumbling bathroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee took on the kitchen with all of the resolve of a tech entrepreneur. He spent a month talking to every cabinet maker in NYC before accepting that even the lowest price for a high-end, custom built set was way beyond what he was willing to put in for the entire project. Even the next tier down felt costly, and the slightly more budget-friendly options at big box retailers didn&#8217;t seem like an obvious slam dunk. After reading positive reviews about IKEA cabinets, and realizing that a <a href="https://sweeten.com/inspiration/cabinets-shelving/renovation-heads-new-ikea-cabinet-line-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole new IKEA line was about to hit the market</a>, he found himself psyched by the look of the white, high-gloss lacquer Sektion option. The cost-benefit of going with IKEA was immediately evident: for well under $10k, Lee got a full set of kitchen cabinets and was really happy with the quality. The downside? Getting delivery right took weeks of follow-up and re-shipments to get all of the pieces on site. A great deal overall, but most definitely not without headaches and hand-holding. But details, details&#8230;take a look at what happened when the wall came down and the cabinets went in!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee&#8217;s research paid off in other parts of the kitchen. He loved the look of white marble and spent six months on the hunt for a quartz countertop with a similar feel, ultimately landing on a porcelain slab by <a href="https://www.eurowest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euro West</a> with an almost-identical yet indestructible effect. Lee compared the slab side by side with marble at Mark and Benneton in Brooklyn and never looked back. To keep his budget focused, Lee decided to skip a typical tiled backsplash. With the newly opened room, and with an upper row of cabinets only on one side, it ended up being a smart choice. Lee thought carefully about cabinet placement &#8211; drawers only along the left (16&#8243; depth to maximize open space) and a slim row of upper cabinets centered on the right. The team installed the counter-depth <a href="https://home.liebherr.com/en/usa/ncsa/residential-appliances/household-appliances.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liebherr fridge</a> against the back wall and lined up all other appliances &#8211; a Samsung stove with sleek visual controls, a stainless steel <a href="https://www.blombergappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blomberg dishwasher</a>, and a <a href="https://www.blanco.com/us-en/kitchen-sinks/sink-types/kitchen-sinks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blanco Quatrus</a> sink on the opposite side &#8211; leaving plenty of room in all directions for food prep and hosting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee was entirely unsentimental about the bathroom. Everything had to go and in its place, lots of clean, bright whites and crisp glass. Lee found happiness in a touchless San Souci <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Touchless-Toilets/content/TouchlessToilets.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, &#8220;designed for OCD people&#8221; (yup&#8230;we know and love a few of those folks), and also went with a Kohler recessed medicine cabinet above the <a href="https://www.frescabath.com/Bathroom_Vanities_s/1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresca sink vanity</a>. The bathroom hardware is all <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/bath/products/showers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansgrohe</a> &#8211; we love that full shower suite with all of its bells and whistles. Lee&#8217;s heavy research brought in one more big catch: he found a specialty frameless shower glass from <a href="https://www.mirageusa.com/#!single-door/cods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirage Shower Doors</a> that eliminates the slight green aura that lots of shower doors end up with and lets the Glassos white wall tiles do their thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Big thanks to Lee and the Sweeten team for a stunning redo, and for all of this insider research!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re back with Ellen and Ben, first time buyers in Brooklyn’s Kensington neighborhood and the duo behind one of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our most favorite Sweetened black and white baths</a>. Thankfully, Ellen had two shots at creating the perfect bathroom oasis in her family&#8217;s two bed, two bath co-op &#8212; if she&#8217;d stopped with the master bath, we would have missed out on a whole new way to take a 1960s bathroom from particle board cabinetry and bland beige tile to all modern and all white gleam. Ellen and Ben hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a> to tackle their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second bathroom renovation</a>, modernize its features, and add a little custom storage that goes a long way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13480 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B.png" alt="SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B" width="600" height="409" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-00-COVER-B-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-13478"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of focusing on the various offenses of the original bath, Ellen took a singular approach to keeping the space as open and as bright as possible. With Alan&#8217;s help, the family decided to leave fixtures in their original locations and Ellen set off on the hunt for tile to replace the chunky beige wall tiles and mini cubed floor tiles that were the defining features of the room&#8217;s look and feel. Ellen also eyed the sink vanity as an opportunity to reclaim a bit of space. It&#8217;s not that the original vanity&#8217;s square footage was so hefty, but as the visual focal point, it jutted into the bathroom&#8217;s center and acted as an unnecessary extension of the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13479" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112.jpg" alt="IMG_1112" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1112-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen opted for round penny tile in a matte white finish and then went big with it, lining the floor, the tub, the mirror frame, and the walls in the same geometric finish. This much shiny penny tile might have been overwhelming, but the smooth matte finish and the surrounding light gray grout instead feel calming and add beautiful texture to the all-white approach. An unintended bonus of going exclusively white is that this bathroom is often filled with colorful children&#8217;s bath toys &#8211; an instant way to brighten the room and add real-life &#8220;accent&#8221;!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen and Ben went with a wall-mounted sink, foregoing a conventional vanity and under-cabinet storage. The minimalist basin leaves just enough room for narrow countertop display and a hanging towel rod, and Ellen added similarly stream-lined faucet features with a wall mount and single handle. The simplicity of all that white tile left room for some especially lovely details: Alan&#8217;s team designed the custom built-in shelving to stow supplies and framed the mirror with a a custom marble ledge. The warm wood from the shelves and the slim stone detailing is subtle but oh so eye-catching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To reduce water usage and minimize cleaning and upkeep needs, Ellen chose a minimalist <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Dual-Flush-Toilets/article/CNT123600001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual-flush Kohler toilet</a>, skirted to conceal piping. A number of the fixtures came from <a href="https://plus.google.com/110060558462840975174?gl=us&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park Slope Plumbing Supply</a>, including the rainwater shower head and family-friendly hand-shower addition. Alan also came through with an unexpected touch, recommending a new white entry door with a modern frosted-glass feature that lets light in without any exposure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This family&#8217;s second bath is second to none. Bravo to Ellen, Ben, and their expert team on a gorgeous renovation!</p>
