<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33307 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-condo-divides-and-conquers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie and Michael&#8217;s</a> Brooklyn apartment renovation (above)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how well you prepare, renovating your home can still seem like a daunting task. The unexpected tends to happen when you least expect it, so take advantage of the hard-won knowledge gleaned by our Sweeten homeowners. We asked them to share their advice for future renovators, listed below. Whether you are planning your first project or are an experienced renovator, these home remodeling tips will help guide you on the path to a successful renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 size-chrono" title="apartment renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01-723x482.gif" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Find pictures of rooms with your planned paint color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracking down real-life examples of paint colors used within rooms <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-condo-divides-and-conquers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabled Sophie to nail down</a> the palette for her renovation. Seeing paint samples in person and within 3-D renderings was helpful, but there&#8217;s more to it. &#8220;You’re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. As a solution, Sophie found photos of rooms online that were painted in the same shades she had selected. &#8220;We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I’d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32378 size-chrono" title="gray-panelled-glass-door-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif" alt="gray panelled glass door over white counter and white bar stools after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-723x1085.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-200x300.gif 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen13-600x900.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Don&#8217;t forget the small details while planning ahead</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning ahead is crucial, and it&#8217;s something that many homeowners post-renovation will emphatically recommend to future renovators. &#8220;It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation,&#8221; Heather and Eric said, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following their apartment remodel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32171 size-chrono" title="white-pillar-dining-table" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg" alt="white pillar near dining table with chandelier in ceiling and brick wall after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: See your finishes— counters, molding, and more—in person</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redoing her living room</a> and bringing the dining area into the kitchen, Rachel said she now understands how important it is to see finishes in person before making any decisions. &#8220;It’s really difficult to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like (in real-life) on a computer screen.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31376 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Estimate how fixtures will fit into rooms—and how you&#8217;ll use them</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you&#8217;re thinking about the big picture, don&#8217;t let the smaller details slip through the cracks. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/desperately-seeking-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sari renovated her bathroom</a>, she shared a few tips for a successful remodel: &#8220;Make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. Also, check which side of the toilet you want your flusher on, because you can’t change that.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Use your belongings to make more accurate measurements</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining her apartment</a> with the one next door, Zoe noted that ironing out the details, like knowing how big the closets and drawers should be, will keep your project moving along smoothly. “Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” She also measured the maximum size of her pots so she could find drawers that were the right height.</p>

</a>Homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha and Adam</a> with their two daughters</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the best way to learn is by experience. After that, the second-best way to learn is by talking to people who have been in your shoes. Sweeten homeowners emerge from the renovation process with more than a few &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments and generously share their hard-won renovation advice with our readers on the blog. We’ve gathered some of their most meaningful advice below. Wherever you are in your renovation journey, we hope this insight will help as you create your very own home sweet home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Measure around your belongings for the most accurate spacing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this homeowner’s kitchen</a> were too shallow; in fact, closing the cabinet doors had chipped most of her plates. When it came time to renovate, deeper cabinets were a must. If you’re planning a kitchen renovation, this homeowner shares the following advice: “Measure all your cookware and then use those measurements to design your kitchen cabinets. It made us feel a little OCD to do this, but it really paid off.” Even if you plan on buying stock cabinets vs. custom-made, measuring the interiors to make sure that all of your cookware will fit is a smart move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30430 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Short on time? Order materials as early as possible.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to make a tight timeline work, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-moody-bath-for-a-getaway-home-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate and Michelle</a> recommend that future renovators order materials as soon as possible. “Make sure you have all the pieces before starting. That includes the tile, fixtures, vanities, toilets, and even the little things like towel hooks and toilet paper holders. That way, you can avoid delays while waiting for some piece to come in,” Nate said. Purchasing stock items versus custom or special order will make it easier to stay on schedule. At Sweeten, we see homeowners placing orders for materials without consulting with their contractor on the timeline, which can cause major project delays, so this is sage advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29713 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Prepare for paint hues to look different on your walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major lessons that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke</a> learned while renovating is that paint colors never look the way you expect them to look once they’re on the walls of your home. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead,” Brooke said. The takeaway: if there’s a tint, or a hint of another color, visible from the paint swatch, expect it to have a much bigger effect on your space when your walls are painted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29899 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Soundproofing can be worth the expense for privacy and comfort</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soundproofing is rarely noticeable—it’s essentially invisible—but the role it plays can have an enormous impact on your daily life. “Paying more for soundproofing the bathroom (so you don’t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny,” <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha</a> said. “We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.” Of course, you don’t have to soundproof your bathroom, but if you can fit it into your budget, this extra step elevates the comfort of your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Conserve funds in parts of your budget to help pay for unexpected issues</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sticking to your budget can be difficult, especially when quality is your top priority. However, doing so pays off when something unexpected happens—like discovering that you need more materials than you budgeted for. When considering brands of non-toxic paint, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah</a> looked at high-end options first before choosing a budget-friendly brand. The economically priced VOC-free paint turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten,” said Sarah. Since she chose an affordable option from the get-go, the extra gallons of paint didn’t break the budget.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re like most cooks, you have a medley of spice containers in your kitchen, including some duplicates because it&#8217;s easy to forget what you already own when out food shopping. Spice storage is becoming a frequent request</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">wall niches or built-in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>—to <span class="s1">house these valuable ingredients. Those renovating have a prime opportunity to factor this into planning their kitchen layouts because </span>the last thing you want to do is fumble around for the paprika with a hot pan on the stove. To kick your spice game up a notch, here are 5 creative ideas from Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23716 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio and Melina&#8217;s</a> renovated kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After dealing with past kitchens that lacked storage, Fabio and Melina wanted their new kitchen to have plenty of it, especially since they both love to cook. Concealed pantry storage was built around the fridge and a pull-out drawer was added for storing spices. The spice drawer lives inside the upper lip of a much deeper drawer filled with baking essentials, maximizing the storage potential of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23717 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Open shelving in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen, once small and cramped, needed to fit two cooks working side by side. The old kitchen was filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, a design dilemma that would be best served by custom cabinetry. To mix it up, open shelving was added, presenting the perfect solution for storing spices and cookbooks near the stove.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23718 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="Spice rack niche" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/tired-hudson-heights-home-reveals-stylish-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica and David&#8217;s</a> spice storage niche</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jessica and David decided to build a new closet along the wall separating their dining room from the kitchen so that they could use the dining room space as a bedroom in the future. Although the placement of the closet cut a chunk out of the kitchen, they were able to take back some of the lost space by carving out a niche with plenty of shelves for storing spices. As a bonus, the convenient storage also makes it easy for them to keep track of what they have in stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack custom cabinetry" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In building out Ketrina’s formerly tiny kitchen with new custom cabinets, bonus upper and lower units were added to the design to make better use of the space and hide some pipes. One such cabinet placed between the stove and the window was the perfect size to store spices, proving that every inch counts when it comes to boosting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23723 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="Pull-out spice rack" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Pull-out spice rack in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work-from-home writers Amanda and her husband cook often and wanted a kitchen in which they&#8217;d feel comfortable working in together. With a sizable collection of seasonings, a pull-out spice rack was added next to the stove and cleverly concealed as cabinetry, making it easy for both cooks to have what they need when the recipe calls for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>Feeling stuck in your renovation? Look to the stars for inspiration</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your home needs a renovation, and you’re not sure where to start, why not consult the celestial bodies for some answers? Whether your sign is connected to fire, water, earth or air, each element leans toward certain colors, styles, or texture preferences. In order to prepare you for what lies ahead, we’ve compiled the best materials and techniques for each of the 12 zodiac signs. Read on to reveal what the stars say about your renovation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20275 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-03-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p><strong>Aquarius</strong> (January 20-February 18)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You prefer to keep things open, so having fewer partitioned rooms should be the first thing on your punch list. Connecting your living spaces, like your dining and living room, is a great way to create an airy and inviting home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22289 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Cybele_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="Kitchen with turquoise subway tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p><strong>Pisces</strong> (February 19-March 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>You&#8217;re someone with a big imagination who prefers the path of least resistance. Surrounding yourself with brightly colored and glossy materials will provide endless inspiration to keep your creativity flowing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Aries</strong> (March 21-April 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>You have a strong sense of self and you like to put your own stamp on things. Texture and color combined can create a bold look and let you stand out from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22374 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /><br />

<p><strong>Taurus</strong> (April 20-May 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>One might say you’re bullheaded, but that’s just another way of saying that you have strong opinions, which is a good thing when it comes to design. With an inclination towards keeping things simple, incorporating natural materials like soapstone into your home is the way to go.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22279 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg" alt="Open shelving in white and wood kitchen" width="723" height="492" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-723x492.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-300x204.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop-600x409.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Becky_Kitchen-05_Crop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p><strong>Gemini</strong> (May 21-June 20)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You’re someone who’s unpredictable and lives for variety, so it only makes sense that you’d want to keep things open to the winds of change. Open shelving lets you mix things up, switching out your display with each passing season or mood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22296 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_HenryApt-05_Crop-723x506.jpg" alt="Modern bathroom with silver accents" width="723" height="506" /><br />

<p><strong>Cancer</strong> (June 21-July 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>As a careful planner who prefers to keep things consistent, you’re not one to rock the boat. Try rippled tile for an effect that suggests flowing water to help you keep your cool.</p>

</strong><strong><br />
Leo</strong> (July 23-August 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Fire</p>
<p>Your sign displays a lot of confidence and pride, and you find yourself always wanting to be the center of attention. Nothing says &#8220;look at me!&#8221; like a saturated pop of color. An accent wall in Hamilton Blue can be a conversation-starter.</p>

<p><strong>Virgo</strong> (August 23-September 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Earth</p>
<p>As someone who is well-organized and prefers order and balance, you feel a connection with the natural world. Custom shelving can add order and a sense of calm to any room.</p>

<p><strong>Libra</strong> (September 23-October 22)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re level-headed, and having your home be in harmony is very important to you. A cutout can connect your living spaces, bridging the gap between separate rooms to let them harmonize with one another.</p>

<p><strong>Scorpio</strong> (October 23-November 21)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Water</p>
<p>Some might say you&#8217;re intense, and you often find yourself laser-focused on the next task in front of you. High-gloss and reflective finishes around your home can keep you in touch with the world around you.</p>

<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong> (November 22-December 21)<br />
Element: Fire</p>
<p>You’re a confident, straightforward person who doesn&#8217;t need to embellish your home to feel good about yourself. Soft hues, like this wall color in Gobi Desert, can be a great way to reflect that self-assuredness.</p>

<p><strong>Capricorn</strong> (December 22-January 19)<br />
<strong>Element:</strong> Air</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a master of self-discipline with a penchant for realism. When it comes to designing your home, granite is a solid choice that will stand the test of time.</p>
