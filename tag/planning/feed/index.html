			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering laminate wood flooring for your home? The benefits abound, from costs and style to durability</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="brown-laminate-wood-flooring" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg" alt="Brown laminate wood flooring with beige bench and side stool" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-51403 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Laminate-wood-flooring-guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With lumber prices skyrocketing, many homeowners are rethinking their material choices for renovations. One alternative to hardwood flooring, that deserves a second look, is laminate that looks like wood. Although lumber prices are starting to drop back to normal levels, Sweeten lays out what the benefits are beyond price alone to choosing laminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is laminate flooring?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Lamination is a process of uniting layers of material by an adhesive (or other means.) Laminate wood flooring is just that–it is three material layers pressed together, using heat, to create a strong product. The base layer of laminate flooring is wood particleboard, followed by a layer with a wood image, known as the design layer. Over top is a protective transparent wear layer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It is easy to confuse laminate wood flooring with vinyl wood flooring. The main difference is their composition: laminate is 99% wood product, and vinyl wood flooring is all plastic.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with everything, there are tradeoffs when choosing one material over another. However, laminate flooring has a lot going for it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Pros:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Less expensive than hardwoods</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Durable: kid- and pet-friendly</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Comes in many styles and color options</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Is easy to install as a DIY project</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Can last from 10 to 25 years, depending on quality, care, and amount of use</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Generally eco-friendly: Made of post-consumer wood products; no need for glues or adhesives in installation; can be removed and re-used; can be recycled </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">Cons:</span></strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s1">Unlike solid hardwood flooring, laminate can’t be refinished when it begins to show signs of wear</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">It&#8217;s not 100% waterproof (not recommended for kitchens, bathrooms, or over cement slabs, as in basements)</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s1">Difficult to repair</span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features of laminate wood flooring</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring has been around for more than 40 years. Over that time, manufacturers have improved on both the product’s performance and style. Today, there seem to be endless variations of the types of laminate available. Here are some of the features to keep in mind when choosing the right kind of laminate floors for your renovation.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Style and design</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because laminate flooring is manufactured, the sky’s the limit on styles. With advances in technology, laminate wood flooring can very closely imitate the look and feel of real hardwoods. Today’s laminate includes grooves and ridges in the texture that create a natural-looking character. Boards come in all sizes: short, long, thin, or wide-plank. Want that hand-scraped wood look? No problem. Working on a coastal look? Laminate comes in gray and white-washed stains. You can choose your look by color variation, wood species, style theme, and size.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Underlayment</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is installed as a floating floor. As a part of proper installation, a separate underlayment is required. The <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">type of underlayment</span></a> varies depending on the subfloor. However, some laminate wood flooring products come with attached underlayment. In this case, a separate underlayment is not necessary. Pay attention when you buy as to whether or not your planks already come with or without this feature.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Waterproof</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No laminate wood flooring is truly waterproof; for that, look to vinyl wood flooring. Despite this, you will see laminate wood flooring on the market, advertised as being waterproof. This tends to mean it is “spillproof.” Read the warranty closely. In the case where water gets under the flooring, either due to standing water under an appliance or installation over a previous cement slab, the wood material can still be damaged.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Noise resistance</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some laminate manufacturers market features to reduce sound transmission underfoot. This can include attached backings, or the option to pair the flooring with a specific additional underlayment pad. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Use with radiant floor heating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Radiant heating is a type of in-floor heating system that goes below the floor covering. Just as some solid wood species are better than others for use with radiant heating, the same goes for laminate. There are laminate wood flooring products designed for use with radiant heating. Discuss with your contractor what humidity levels you need to maintain to avoid gapping between the boards. </span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Durability rating</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring is known for being durable. Just how durable? Check <a href="https://www.builddirect.com/learning-center/flooring/laminate-flooring-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s8">its AC rating</span></a>. Short for Abrasion Criteria, the rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most durable. AC1 is suitable for low-traffic areas. For residential uses, AC3 or AC4 is generally advised for high-traffic rooms.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Laminate wood flooring cost vs. hardwood</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Obviously, solid hardwood flooring comes from planks milled from real trees. And that explains why, generally speaking, solid hardwood floors cost more than laminate flooring. The price is tied to factors such as weather, the rareness of wood, <span class="s8">and export costs</span>. Conversely, laminate wood flooring costs are based on its quality and style features: thickness; durability of wear layer; and presence of underlayment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While laminate overall is less expensive than hardwoods, high-end laminate wood may cost more per square foot than low-end hardwoods. When choosing your laminate flooring, think about your durability needs, in addition to the other features we covered. (And, keep in mind, there are other variables to consider overall <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s9">when choosing a flooring material!)</span></a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does hardwood flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/how-much-does-flooring-cost/"><span class="s9">Forbes</span></a>, hardwood flooring costs can average from $3–$12 a square foot. Add to that $26 (or higher) for 500 square feet of the required underlayment. Labor costs for hardwood flooring installation add an extra $3–$9 a square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The type of wood you choose affects the cost. <span class="s9">For example</span>, an exotic hardwood, like Brazilian walnut, can range from $8–$14 a square foot. A softer, more plentiful wood, such as pine, averages from $3–$6 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Adding together materials and labor averages, total hardwood flooring costs can range between $6–$21 a square foot. For perspective, costs to install real hardwood flooring in a 500-square-foot area would be between $3,000–$10,500.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much does laminate flooring cost?</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s10">Most laminate flooring comes with an interlocking tongue-and-groove system. </span><span class="s1">Being a very DIY-friendly option, it’s helpful to focus on material costs alone. Laminate flooring can be purchased for as low as $0.59 a square foot, and can range upwards of $6 a square foot. Purchasing laminate with an attached underlayment will cost you more up-front, but will save on labor later.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s11">Breaking <span class="s12">this down further, laminate</span></span><span class="s2"> with a thin wear layer is available for as low as under $1 a square foot. Medium-quality laminate ranges from $2–$4, and high-quality sells for $3–$5+ a square foot.</span></p>
<h4>How much does it cost to install laminate wood flooring?</h4>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">If you’d rather have a pro install your laminate wood flooring, labor costs average between $1–$3 a square foot. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Altogether with materials and labor combined, laminate floors can cost as low as $1.59 and as high as $9 a square foot. That means it would cost between $795 and $4,500 to install laminate wood flooring in a 500-square-foot area.</span></p>
<h5>Choosing laminate floors for your home</h5>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The advances in laminate flooring technology over the past several decades have made a once-eschewed flooring material a strong contender to hardwoods. With its lower cost, durability, eco-friendliness, and wide range of style options, more people today are happily picking laminate hardwood flooring for their homes.</span></p>

A full-service design/build general contracting firm can also offer comprehensive architectural services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">After your plans are complete, you will use them to find a general contractor that meets your needs. If your project requires an architect, your <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor may also be able to refer one. </span><span class="s1">The most successful projects will use an architect and contractor that have worked together before and complement each other’s work.</span></p><p class="p5">Here, <span class="s2">we</span> lay out the full details on when your project will need an architect and how much you should expect to pay. <span class="s1">Our vetted contractors can help homeowners access different levels of architectural services and architects. </span></p><h3 class="p5">You’ll need an architect when the DOB requires signed plans</h3><p class="p5">First, your city/building may require you to use one. Are you are making any significant changes that require the involvement of your Department of Buildings? If so, then you&#8217;ll need an architect to make applications and pull permits. As architect Shannon Reid of <a href="https://rwa.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Reid Wilson Architects</span></a> told us, “<span class="s4">Each jurisdiction has a clear delineation on what types of projects require a licensed professional to sign and seal the drawings. NYC is more restrictive than most, and homeowners may find an architect is required due to DOB regulations.” </span></p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if the remodel affects walls, electrical, and plumbing</h3><p class="p8"><span class="s5">“</span>An architect is generally required when a remodel requires the removing or relocation of walls,” as architect John Kim of <a href="http://kmystudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Kimoy Studios</span></a> told us.</p><p class="p8">If walls are being moved, your remodel will likely “affect plumbing counts or locations,” and require city, as well as co-op/condo board approvals, as architect Steven Harper of <a href="https://www.mndpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">MNDPC</span></a> explained.</p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if you want a professional to manage the project</h3><p class="p8">According to Shannon, “Architects often act as owner’s representatives during the construction phase.” Also, “&#8230;during construction, the architect follows the project to make sure the contractor is following the drawings and the end result is what the homeowner has approved.&#8221;</p><p class="p8">All that said, “architects are essentially professional problem solvers, so any remodel or modification could benefit from the advice or services an architect can offer,” said architect Steven.</p><h3 class="p10">What services do architects offer?</h3><p class="p5">Given the scale of these types of projects, the money spent on architectural services is worth it! One key benefit: architects will project-manage the remodel from start to finish. This is ideal for busy homeowners or those new to remodeling. Additionally, architects use their training to create an optimal and thoughtful design to suit your lifestyle. This guarantees that your new space suits your needs perfectly.</p><p class="p10">When you hire an architect, you can opt for a full suite of services. This includes the following:</p><p><img decoding="async" title="hire-architect-project-graph" class="alignnone wp-image-31023 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg" alt="when to hire an architect project graph" width="1032" height="552" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg 1032w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-300x160.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p><h3 class="p10">How much does an architect cost?</h3><p class="p5">That sounds great, you say! But how much will it cost? For residential remodels, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. In major urban areas like New York City, this is typically between 15-20 percent for a project costing under $100,000. Large or costly projects budgeted above $250,000 or more can sometimes be billed at a lower percentage, between 10-15 percent.</p><p class="p5">When it comes to permit fees or application fees, they are either required fixed fees or are based on the cost of construction. <span class="s6">These vary based on location but in general, once a project is under construction, additional fees might be paid to the Department of Buildings.</span> Expect fees if you change the plans and the application needs to be amended, or if the construction time is extended.</p><p class="p11"><span class="s8">The cost of an expediter is often minimal when working with the Department of Buildings in towns outside city limits (you don’t usually need one). </span>It’s not uncommon to be able to walk into the buildings department of smaller towns and obtain the information you’re looking for without an expediter.</p><p class="p5">Some architects may charge a fixed rate, an hourly rate, or a cost per square foot. However, these fee structures are less common for full-service residential remodel projects.</p><h3 class="p10">Can I hire an architect for standalone services?</h3><p class="p5">If you do not plan to do a gut remodel, it doesn’t make sense to pay for the full package. However, there are certain situations where you may need an architect for just one part of your project. For example, if <span class="s9">your building requires schematic designs</span> by a registered architect (RA), for a fairly small bathroom project.</p><p class="p5">For those who are willing to provide one-off services, you will typically work out an hourly billing arrangement. Alternately, they may <span class="s10">charge a flat rate based on the time needed to complete it. </span>Some architects do not charge for initial consultations. If they do, they&#8217;ll apply that cost towards the project total if you award the project to them.</p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Depending on their experience and seniority, a project manager&#8217;s hourly rate will range between $100 to $150. For a principal RA, expect $175 to $250. You can also request a cap on the hourly rate if you need to stay within budget. </span></p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Architect Steven told us that </span>they typically offer “pre-design services for a modest fee (fixed cost, not hourly) that would include—among other things—a site visit, code review, preliminary budget and schedule estimates, and feasibility. This fee is credited against the fee for our full services if we proceed with a project. However, the deliverables can just as easily be used to engage with another firm if that is a better fit.”</p><p>Do you need an architect for your project?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Get an edge by installing connected smart home technology during your home remodel</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48936 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg" alt="Image of smart home technology in a shower" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Reno101-SmartTech-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home technology is everywhere today. It has made its way into our vehicles, our workplaces, and our pockets. With smart tech’s skill at automation, it’s no surprise that it has found a perfect place in the home. Nearly<a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/i3-Magazine/i3-Issues/2020/January-February/The-Ringing-Future-of-Smart-Home-Technology"> <span class="s2">70-percent of homes</span></a> already own some type of smart home tech. And that number is only growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some forms of smart home tech are more permanent. Sweeten outlines which ones can best be incorporated during a home remodel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters and controllers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being smart, the average water heater is more like a blunt tool. It maintains hot water even when you don’t need hot water. Or if you turned it down before a vacation, you’ll need to manually turn it back up when you return. It can take hours for the water to heat up again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water heaters connect to your home’s internet through Wi-Fi. This gives you remote access to all of the water heater’s functions. You can adjust temperature and set schedules. You can even monitor the status and shut it down if there’s a problem. This gives you a chance to call in a technician and avert disastrous water leaks.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart electrochromic (self-tinting) glass windows</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you live in a sunny climate, you know the constant routine of lowering and raising blinds to control inside temperatures. Even northern zones experience peak sunny periods during the summer.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass darkens or lightens automatically in response to solar changes throughout the day. No blinds are required and nothing physically moves. While the windows require power for this operation, the amount of power is minimal. For 2,000 square feet of glass, the electricity required would only power a 60V-watt light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-tinting glass is truly cutting-edge smart home technology. It is still not widely available. But it is worth looking into if you live in places with heavy solar and heat demands.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart connected appliances</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do all of your home’s separate appliances work as one? Probably not. Likely, they perform their own duties separately. A new and smarter option is to consider them as components of a larger system. According to<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/smart_home_tips"> <span class="s2">EnergyStar</span></a>, appliances with connected functionality use less energy than conventional appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a two-part system. One, you’ll need to purchase smart appliances with that next big remodeling project. That includes refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Two, you’ll need a unifying management system that can recognize and operate those appliances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EnergyStar’s SHEMS program is one program that is available for free. Google Home is another popular program that acts as a hub for an ever-growing number of smart devices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart home security systems</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, “smart” was the missing link of home security systems. Home alarms would report to an off-site monitoring center. From there, a call would be placed to local police and to the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But smart security systems put homeowners front-and-center and keep them informed. That information is dually shared with the monitoring center and homeowner in real-time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While wireless security systems are popular, wired systems do have strong points. Cameras with wires running through attics or behind walls are difficult to tamper with. A hidden or locked-up digital video recorder (DVR) records hundreds or thousands of hours. Wireless cameras with SD cards record a few hours before rolling over and erasing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart radiant wall heating</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On cold nights, hot air gushing from the central heating system’s vents is a welcome feeling. But if you were to watch with a thermal imaging camera, you’d see just how inefficient this is. Orange and yellow areas of warm air build up in some areas. Blue and green spots indicate places where the heat does not reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large radiant heating panels mounted on the walls evenly distribute the warm air. A thermostat notices that the room is cold. It signals to a smart controller located in a separate area. That signal is relayed to a manifold, which sends hot water from a boiler to the radiant heating panels.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart water monitors</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your home may already have a smart water meter on the street. Installed by the water company, this meter reports the level of your usage wirelessly to the company. This is what generates your monthly bill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can install a similar device that you own and control. A licensed plumber splices the smart water monitor (not meter) into your home’s water supply line. The monitor communicates with your home’s Wi-Fi system. With an app, you can track your water consumption and can make adjustments to save water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, a smart water monitor can sense unusual fluctuations in the water flow. These fluctuations may indicate a break in one of the pipes. Since the monitor is located at the start of the pipes, it can shut down all water to the house. This can stop devastating water line breaks before they happen.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Smart garage door openers</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Garage doors remote controls are helpful, but they have a very limited radius. With a smartphone, you can control a smart garage door from anywhere you have a cell phone connection. You might be halfway to work and you think that you forgot to close the door. With the app, you can verify whether you did. If so, you can shut it remotely. Or you might need to open the garage door because a neighbor wants to borrow your mower. Smart garage doors expand the reach of the old remote control.</span></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay but choosing a few or even just one device or smart home technology system can offer a convenient way to stay on top of the inner mechanics of your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>COVID-19 brings opportunities if you want to remodel your home, but you’ll need to know how to navigate</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg" alt="Image of a room in the middle of painting" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>During COVID-19, certain renovation projects became even more important for homeowners</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44610 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg" alt="Image of the interior of a renovated Hamptons ranch home" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rosaire-kitchen-dining-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #76808f;">turns the garage into a living room</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to take a hard look at our homes. Many were grateful for the security and comfort our homes offered. But many more made note of the features that their homes lacked. At a time when almost half of the workforce was working from home and schools relied on distance learning, renovation projects became top of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the renovation mindset may be a little different going forward. Jean Brownhill, the founder and CEO of Sweeten discussed the current state of renovation on <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sweeten-founder-jean-brownhill-on-new-rules-renovation/id1520457603?i=1000504585856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Time</a>,</em> a podcast hosted by <em>Domino</em> editor-in-chief Jessica Romm Perez. One trend they discussed is the emergence of practicality and functionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s goal is to make their finished project picture perfect. But to actually live in the space, other things may be more important. Here are some top projects Sweeten saw grow in popularity over the last year.</span></p>
<h3>Top COVID-19 renovation projects</h3>
<h4>Creating new living areas</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With people spending so much time at home, they adapted their living spaces to new uses. Many people upgraded their outdoor living areas by adding outdoor kitchens and other living spaces. Also, it wasn&#8217;t clear if a vacation away would be possible, so outdoor living space became more important. It also makes it possible to socialize with others if indoor entertaining isn’t an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because health clubs and gyms were closed, many people looked for ways to squeeze a workout space into their living areas. People <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-modern-basement-renovation-produces-a-clean-slate-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adapted spare rooms or unfinished areas</a> like basements to create home gyms. </span></p>
<h4>Kitchen and bathroom remodels still in the spotlight</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen and bathroom renovations are still popular. Although kitchens have always had many uses, their multitasking ability became more important during the pandemic. Kids often did their remote learning there, and adults used them for makeshift home offices. That&#8217;s in addition to the regular cooking, eating, and cleaning that goes on in a kitchen. The National Kitchen and Bath Association reports that in addition to upgraded appliances, there was an increase in requests for easy-to-clean surfaces, video watching ability, and device charging stations in the cook space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bathrooms became personal sanctuaries more than ever before. After a few weeks that turned into months into the pandemic, people came to value self-care more than ever. Even those who had not considered bath renovations undertook them to improve on their self-care routine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bath update trends include oversized showers that feature multiple spray heads and body sprays, as well as a steam option. Voice commands can activate preset water temperatures and start music from a personal playlist. Ventilation fans do more than removing moisture: some have LED lighting that helps prevent mold growth. Others feature multi-color lights to change the mood of the room. Many spa-like features can be controlled by smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that most renovations had in common was ease of maintenance. You can renovate a space that looks great, but you have to live in it. &#8220;I think that is one reason why porcelain tiles and planks are so popular,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They are easy to clean and they can be made to look like any material. &#8220;</span></p>
<h4>Reworking existing spaces</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, we can relate to how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our work habits. The typical household can get hectic with everyone vying for counter space where they can work, as well as computer time. The problem was frequently solved by setting up work and play areas throughout the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean mentioned the trend of installing temporary glass panels in the home. These solve the noise problem that happens when someone is on a video call while someone else is unloading the dishwasher, other people are having a conversation, and kids are running around playing. Panels and interior windows give people acoustic separation. &#8220;We’re not looking for visual separation, but what we do want, and need, is acoustic separation,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closet organizing system that lets you store things neatly and efficiently may be of more use than a room straight out of the pages of a magazine. &#8220;As someone doing a renovation, you don&#8217;t rise to the level of your goals so much as you fall to the level of the systems you put in place,&#8221; said Jean. While we usually want our homes to look fashionable, the emphasis for homes was on function for 2020. </span></p>
<h4>Using unused space</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As floor plans were reconfigured, any unused or underutilized areas became prime real estate. Guest bedrooms became home offices or study lounges. But the real stars were spaces like basements, attics, and garages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attics became playrooms for children. Basements were also used as play areas, but many were converted to home gyms. Some drywall and flooring, and maybe a little weatherproofing, turned these storage areas into useful living spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some places, such as Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people are adding ADUs</a>. An ADU is short for accessory dwelling unit. It is a new living space added to an existing building. Garages are being converted to home offices, but also studio apartments. The apartments can be rented out in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presents new reasons to think creatively about our living spaces. Although we hope the pandemic will stay a once-in-a-lifetime event, we can all take cues from these COVID-19 renovation projects to inspire our own spaces at home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">From L-shaped or galley to an island kitchen, use these ideas to choose which kitchen layout is best for your home </span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short counter<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No matter the size of your home, there’s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space. Keep in mind the kitchen activities that are important to your lifestyle, plot the best layout and flow, and get ready for your dream cook space.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">L-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to find space for counter eating</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34966 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Planning a renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-723x482.jpg" alt="starting a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN_Nazli_Master_Lounge-Before-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation process has many layers, but understanding your goals and how to prepare for them is the first step. Having a clear scope and budget when you’re ready to find the right contractor is a good position to be in. Here, we offer a guide on how to plan a home renovation and set yourself up for success from start to finish.</p>
<h3>1. Choose your renovation “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners renovate for many reasons—you just bought a new space that needs a refresh (or a gut!), your family is growing or you’d like to downsize, a repair is needed and a long-awaited renovation makes sense now, or maybe what you have just isn’t working for you. Whatever the reason driving the decision, the first step for any major renovation is crucial: identify the “must-have” elements for your home. Have an idea of what’s definitively required and you will be better equipped to have an informed conversation when the time comes to meet with general contractors and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Equally important is making a wishlist of “nice-to-haves.” This includes all of the changes you’d like to see, but would be willing to forgo due to budget limitations. In tandem with determining the “must-haves” and the “nice-to-haves,” decide the exact space(s) you are renovating, and what kind of updates (cosmetic, gut, layout changes, etc.), you plan to make. While a cosmetic update would not involve any layout changes or moving of plumbing and/or electrical, a gut renovation means demolishing the existing space down to the studs, and rebuilding the entire interior floor-to-ceiling.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Determine who to hire for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have your list of “must-haves,” you’ll have a better sense of what type of expert you’ll need for your renovation. Depending on what you’re planning to do, you’ll want to meet with different types of experts.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">When to work with <strong>general contractors</strong>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>removing or replacing finishes but generally keeping things in the same place</li>
<li>comfortable selecting fixtures and finishes yourself</li>
<li>ready to start construction</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to work with an <strong>architect and a general contractor, or a design-build firm:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>making major layout or structural changes</li>
<li>moving plumbing or gas lines</li>
<li>renovating a landmark property</li>
<li>looking for professional design help</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While many general contractors can provide general guidance when it comes to selecting fixtures and finishes, you may also want to hire an interior designer if you want more extensive help creating your ideal space. Most <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors can refer you to an architect they&#8217;ve done work with if their services are required. If it looks like you’ll need an architect for your renovation, you may be able to hire a design-build firm to help as a one-stop shop. As the name suggests, this type of firm takes care of the design as well as the construction phase of a project. Some lean more design-forward while others are construction-forward. Interview a few to see what you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tip:</strong> When you post your renovation to find a general contractor, we’ll match you with GCs and design-build firms best suited to your project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Research the cost of your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is always the tough part—figuring out how much money you’ll need for the renovation. How much should you spend? How much do you have to spend? As a starting point, we have seen the average cost to renovate <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entire home</a> typically between $80 to $200 per square foot. The price can vary from room to room, as <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen upgrades</a> and bathrooms tend to be more expensive and bedrooms and living rooms cost less. Costs also vary based on geographical location.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47677 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg" alt="how long does a kitchen remodel take" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kitchen-Split-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read how long it takes to remodel a kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s break it down: you’ll need to consider the cost of labor, materials, and finishes, plus associated fees like city permits, board approvals, and/or design fees. If you plan to hire a designer and/or an architect, account for the fact that both charge a percentage (ranging from 5 to 20 percent of project costs) for their fee.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs for remodeling materials and finishes</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understandably, many people focus on the visible aspects of the renovation—the materials and finishes—which, depending on whether you choose budget, mid-, or high-end products, will account typically for 50 percent or less of the full cost of the renovation. The good news is that this is the first step to understanding what kind of renovation you’ll be able to afford; take a look at various retailers and websites to see how much that Moroccan tile costs per square foot. An efficient way to do this is to list the materials you’d like to include, and price out all the materials in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> See our <a href="https://sweeten.com/remodeling-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation cost guides</a> for city-level cost estimates.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Costs for remodeling labor</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, you’ll want to account for the cost of labor. As each firm is different, the best way to do this is to meet with general contractors to get a sense of how much their labor costs will run. There are many variables; in the busy summer season, for example, labor tends to be more expensive than during the winter months. They will also assess your specific job site. If you live in a co-op building with difficult street parking, plus strict rules governing the renovation itself in terms of allowable work hours and protection of the common areas, labor will be costlier than in a standalone house where the contractor has more freedom to park in the driveway and work around the clock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take into consideration wet areas like <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom redesigns</a> or kitchens cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex. The type of finishes you choose will also affect costs. Mosaic tilework and woodworking will require labor with specialized skills compared to basic installations such as subway tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live in a condo or co-op, knowing the specific rules governing your building <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/prepare-renovation-site-visit-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before setting up for a site visit</a> allows your contractor to provide a more accurate bid.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37982 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> (<em>Above</em>) <span class="s1">A <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole-home renovation</a> with an open kitchen, skim-coated walls, and new closets</span></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extra fees for remodeling</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The associated fees that come with renovating are often overlooked. Most city or town permits come with a price tag, and if you live in a co-op or condo, review your building’s alteration agreement/documentation to determine if there are extra costs, such as an engineer mandated by the building to approve your plans.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Budget for contingencies</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, leave a 10% cushion for unexpected costs. Even the best-laid plans sometimes go awry or need tweaking, and that safety net will ensure that you’re not venturing into uncomfortable territory if your renovation costs exceed your budget.</p>
<h3>4. Find the best general contractor or architect for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experts are not necessarily hard to find; the tricky part is <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding the right one</a> for your renovation and communication style. Asking friends or searching through directories can yield many suggestions, but those general contractors may not be the right fit for your specific budget, your location, or your type of project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s where our free service comes in. We help you find the best general contractor for your project, then monitor the project until completion. By posting your project, you’ll be matched with general contractors who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>licensed, insured, and vetted</li>
<li>have experience with renovations like yours</li>
<li>do work in your city, town, or neighborhood</li>
<li>are already interested in your project based on its budget and scope</li>
<li>guarantee their work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Read about <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how our free service works</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Get at least 3 estimates to compare</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with most things in life, you should shop around a little. As a general rule, it’s smart to have at least three bids, (also known as estimates) from different general contractors for your renovation. Not only will this allow you to find the best contractor for your budget, but you’ll be able to find the “right fit” in terms of working style and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Bids often come in different formats from different contractors. We offer a free <a href="https://sweeten.com/bid-leveling-call-for-renovation-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bid-leveling phone call</a> with our renovation experts to help analyze any bids you&#8217;ve received from Sweeten contractors as well as outside firms. We&#8217;ll also offer insight into Sweeten contractors and their communication style.</p>
<h3>6. Choose the best general contractor for you and start renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have met with all of the candidates, reviewed bids, discussed them with your spouse, partner, or housemates (and maybe Sweeten!) and decided on the best option, it’s time to sign the contract. At this point, you will typically pay a percentage (25 to 50 percent, depending on the length and overall budget of the project) upfront. The contract will also set up regular intervals and milestones at which future payments are due.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, it’s time for the fun to begin! Knowing how to plan your renovation successfully means starting with this basic list, and, when you’re ready, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting your project to find a contractor</a>.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to #8 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>When should I start planning for my renovation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>A lot of homeowners come to us when they are in contract on a new property, but haven&#8217;t closed yet. This is a good time to start some preliminary planning, such as outlining the scope of the project—what you&#8217;re aiming to accomplish—and begin selecting materials. However, you really need to wait until you&#8217;ve closed on the property in order to pull permits, get board approval (if necessary), and have easy access to the space for walkthroughs and measuring—all the things that you&#8217;ll need to do to start your renovation.</p>
<p>You might also meet with a general contractor, but keep in mind that close dates sometimes don&#8217;t happen and there&#8217;s a chance the property sale may fall through. It&#8217;s a little harder to get general contractors to come on a site visit at this stage of purchase. It&#8217;s also a challenge to get access to the property. While in contract, we highly recommend starting to plan what you would want to renovate and the level of costs you want to spend on your materials, including your &#8220;must-haves&#8221; and &#8220;nice-to-haves.&#8221; We can&#8217;t emphasize enough how having a good handle on these aspects affect timing and delivery lead times, keeping your project on schedule.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

<p>Over the last year, we studied many of our Sweeten home renovations in NYC and spoke to our contractors and homeowners about their experiences. We gathered important info including the process of <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut remodeling a kitchen</a>, the costs for landscaping and flooring, and adding or <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamping a bathroom</a>. One discovery was that no two home renovations were alike. The other was every homeowner needing guidance for the renovation process, understanding the work ahead, and facing the same common mistakes. We surveyed our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors and design-build firms with a very open-ended question and discovered the top NYC home renovation mistakes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>&#8220;What are the most common things you find yourself explaining to homeowners who are starting the renovation process?&#8221;</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We expected a wide range of responses from these experts and found the opposite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Understanding timelines</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 25% of our experts talked about how hard it is for homeowners to plan for the timeline of the project. Many homeowners make the mistake of thinking solely about the physical labor required, but the majority of projects involve a variety of stages before a hammer touches a single nail. The irony here is that in some cases, physical labor is actually the least time-intensive part of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you are <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with your general contractor</a> and planning your project, be sure to think about the time needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">the design phase</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Department of Building approvals</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">condo and co-op approvals</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">ordering and lead times for materials</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">site staging</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">debris removal</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">adjusting to issues behind walls and under floors that you can&#8217;t forecast until the work begins</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A classic example: Clinton Hill homeowner Diane spent months getting approvals, ordering materials, and putting up with tiles and a toilet sitting in her dining room while she handled all of the prep work for her bathroom renovation. Once the actual project began, Diane had a brand new bathroom in less than two weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Approvals</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forty percent of our Sweeten contractors highlighted how often homeowners underestimate approval steps when planning a renovation. This specific aspect of timing was the single most commonly reported misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Between demanding co-op boards and Department of Buildings requirements, homeowners can spend three to four months navigating paperwork and reviews. Many homeowners are initially most worried about the cost of the project and then find themselves paralyzed and frustrated when they realize that the start of the project is weeks or months away. When one homeowner re-did the floors in their East Village apartment, she mistakenly assumed their building&#8217;s management company would process the straightforward approval request in a few days&#8217; time. As new wood planks were being hauled into her living room, she learned that a required insurance certificate had not yet come through. As a result, the crew had to turn around until the paperwork was in place a few days later. The actual work was done in three days flat. The approvals? Probably three weeks of calls and emails and considerable follow-up before a final thumbs up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Camping out</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners usually can&#8217;t decide whether they should <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stay or go during their remodel</a>. Almost 15% of our experts pointed out that homeowners fail to think through the implications of living without a bathroom or kitchen or stairs while work is underway. They also forget to account for children and pet schedules when planning for the temporary inconvenience of the renovation. Especially in space-deprived NYC homes, homeowners need to realistically plan for the disruption, assess whether they can stay in the space until the work is done, and budget for alternate accommodations if essential spaces will be blocked off. If you are planning a transformative renovation project that will last beyond a few days, or your project entails gutting walls and floors that will expose significant dust and materials, you should expect to live elsewhere until the work is done. Walking a fine line between both options, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-loft-balcony-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Carly</a> didn&#8217;t mind &#8220;slumming&#8221; it. However, she did move out during the messiest stages: demolition and when the ceiling was being raised.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most homeowners prefer to visit the site daily to check on progress and provide visual feedback, so you may not want to leave town altogether. But do consider budgeting for alternate accommodations and maybe even a few days off from work so that you can be available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite unexpected issues popping up or hurdles, homeowners are excited and motivated to go through the process for a completely upgraded space. With the right planning and realistic expectations, Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors in NYC</a> can help you navigate all of these steps. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post your project</a> and let us introduce you to renovation professionals who can get your project done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/0001-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>Since none of the finishes or fixtures in the apartment are worth saving and the layout is somewhat awkward, without a real kitchen or closet space, the best strategy is to gut the interior and begin with a clean slate</p>
<p>The apartment would benefit most from a more open layout, to bring light from the rear windows deeper into the interior.   In addition there are some practical considerations.  There&#8217;s the need for a real kitchen, with adequate counter space and storage. There&#8217;s the need for closet and storage space.  And it&#8217;s best to keep the kitchen and bathroom located where they are, close to the existing plumbing, gas and sewage lines.</p>
<p>The design can go in many different directions, depending on the owner&#8217;s lifestyle and priorities.  Here are some basic ideas:</p>
<p>FOR AN ENTREPENEUR</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/02-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone with her own business, or who sometimes works from home, this scheme builds an 8&#8242;-0&#8243; long work station along the right side of the apartment.  It has a continuous wood work counter, drawers and file cabinets below, and shelving on the wall above.  From here the owner can sit and work without distractions.  When she&#8217;s done, she can clear her things from the counter and the space stays tidy and well-organized, separate from rest of the apartment.</p>
<p>The entire apartment remains open.  At the back is the living and dining area.  At the middle is a bed and a clothing closet.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A FASHIONISTA</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/011-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who cares deeply about fashion, this scheme has a walk in closet with plenty of room for her to keep her clothing and a place where she can get dressed in the morning.  The closet has racks for garments and shelving for shoes, bags and accessories.  There&#8217;s a window for natural light, and room for a chair and a vanity table or standing mirror too.</p>
<p>The remaining space in back becomes a sleeping alcove. The center of the apartment becomes a living area, with built in bookshelves and cabinets.  At the front, near the entry, are a galley kitchen, the bathroom, and linen and coat closets</p>
<p>FOR A GOURMET</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1109 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/03-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>For someone who likes to  cook and entertain, this scheme has a full-size kitchen and a formal dining room.  The double galley kitchen provides plenty of counter and storage space, and room for two or three people to be cooking and prepping at one time.  The dining room is large enough to seat six or eight people.</p>
<p>The back becomes a living area with a fold-out bed.  At the front, near the entry, are the bathroom, a clothes closet and a linen closet.</p>
<p>Any of these layouts could be converted to a proper one-bedroom  by closing off the sleeping area.  This is something that&#8217;s possible but that I would try to work around.  Closing off a bedroom might make the rooms, especially those near the entrance, feel small and dark.</p>
<p>This apartment has a footprint that lends itself to many different layouts.  I&#8217;m very excited to see what choices the owner will make as she sweetens the space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>

<p>My old boss used to say that for every project an architect has three equally-important priorities: cost, quality and schedule.</p>
<p>As I began my remodel, maybe because of my background in design, quality seemed paramount.  Cost was the second concern. Because I had other places to stay during construction, time was the final consideration.</p>
<p>As I moved through the project, though, cost became the overriding concern.  Initially, flushed with optimism, I made payments for materials and services without a fuss.  But as the project moved forward and the total cost crept closer and closer to my limit, I became increasingly suspect about spending money and searched more passionately for less costly substitutions.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the smaller, more ornamental elements.  I spent a little extra money to get a faucet set for my bathroom sink from a high end supplier.  But I didn&#8217;t order the supplier&#8217;s matching toilet paper holder and towel bars because I couldn&#8217;t justify the extra expense for such simple pieces of hardware.  I returned a beautiful towel shelf I had ordered because, when the time came to install it, it felt too opulent.  Instead of ordering kitchen cabinet pulls from the supplier I bought them in bulk at a hardware store.</p>
<p>I was especially alarmed by surprise costs, which came fast and furious at the end of the project.  My building management company mailed me an invoice for the cost of their &#8220;Architectural Review,&#8221; which they had not told me about.  I had to order extra wood panels from the cabinet supplier to complete the installation.  And I needed a myriad of small, last-minute items from the hardware store like a shower curtain rod and a lever for my toilet tank.  Each time I pulled out my credit card I winced.</p>
<p>As in many other things, what helped most was to step back and take a larger view. The remodel was an investment that would ultimately increase the value of my home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-759" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG" alt="Tiling" width="540" height="668" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Architects tend to be perfectionists and also indecisive, which is a dangerous combination.  In the architecture offices where I worked I spent hours locked in conference rooms with colleagues agonizing about the height of a baseboard, the profile of a window mullion, and the location of a light switch.</p>
<p>These are details that aren&#8217;t important to a client and don&#8217;t often affect the overall impact of a project.  But architects agonize over things like this; it&#8217;s part of what they do.  For my kitchen remodel I spent hours deciding between different cherry wood stains, different shades of white paint, and different cabinet door knobs.</p>
<p>In the end details that I thought were highly important were not carried out.  For my bathroom I thought it was crucial to reproduce the tiny 1/32&#8243; tile grout joints from the original walls.  A typical ceramic wall tile grout joint is 1/8&#8243; but I felt that this size joint was simply too wide, too crude, and that it would detract from the beauty of the tile.  I even had a bad dream about it.  In this dream I returned to my bathroom after a week-long holiday and found my shower walls finished with 1/2&#8243; tile joints.  I awoke with a start!</p>
<p>In the end, almost as a comeuppance, my bathroom was completed with 1/8&#8243; grout joints.  This was entirely my own fault.  The tiler began his work very early one morning, before I or the site supervisor could speak to him.  I&#8217;ll never forget walking onto site that day and seeing all the tile laid out on my bathroom walls, absolutely beautifully, and set apart with 1/8&#8243; spacers.  The mason was beaming.  He turned to me and said, &#8220;Look at how much I&#8217;ve completed already.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t ask him to redo the work; he&#8217;d done exactly what was expected.  So instead I took a very deep breath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg" alt="Tile Comparison" width="540" height="156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>In the end the bathroom walls turned out beautifully.  The cream-colored grout that we had selected in order to miminize staining brought out a golden hue in the glaze of the tile.  The original 1/32&#8243; joints that I had wanted had created a colder, more clinical surface.  The 1/8&#8243; joints, which I had abhorred, gave the entire room a warmer, more welcoming feeling.</p>

<p>Whenever someone tells me they&#8217;re starting a home remodeling project I tell them the three things that I&#8217;ve learned in my fifteen years working as an architect.  1.  It will cost more than you expect.  2.  It will take longer than you expect.  3.  It will turn out better than you expect.</p>
<p>Yet when it came to my own remodel didn&#8217;t want to accept that second bit of wisdom.  Each of the contractors I interviewed told me that my remodel would take three weeks, and I believed it.  In the end it took seven full weeks to complete the construction work.  This is through no fault of the contractor&#8217;s.  There were some surprises during demolition and construction that required extra time to handle.</p>
<p>I was lucky because a number of friends invited me stay at their places while work was being done.  And my parents live just an hour  outside of New York.  I knew that I could stay with them for as long as required and commute into the city each day to monitor construction.  At first this &#8220;homelessness&#8221; was sort of fun, like a series of small vacations.  I got to explore different neighborhoods in the city: the Upper West Side, the Lower East Side, Union Square and Park Slope.  I spent quality time with friends and a lovely, relaxing week with my parents.</p>
<p>But after two weeks the novelty of being a vagabond wore off.  Before beginning demolition the contractors had sealed off my clothes closet with blue tape to prevent dust infiltration, so I was limited to the clothes I had packed in my suitcase.  And I had packed very badly, throwing together casual summer clothes in a rolling suitcase.  Then the weather turned and I was invited to some more formal parties and I found it impossible to dress properly.  I wore paint-splattered jeans to  a chi-chi fashion industry event, and flip-flops to a dinner date.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a creature of habit; a disciplined environment helps me to remain focused and productive.  This apartment remodel disrupted every aspect of my life, it shook up my routines of sleeping, bathing, dressing, eating and socializing.  The resulting sense of displacement, both physical and emotional, was unnerving and entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>Mid-way through the project, after demolition was complete and before finishes and fixtures had been installed, was the most difficult time.  At that moment it felt as things would never return to normal,  that I would be rolling around that suitcase forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-753" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG.JPG" alt="Living Room: Mid-construction" width="540" height="644" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG-252x300.jpg 252w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>I visited Kuwait, briefly, in 2006 and the entire place felt as if it were immersed in a dust storm.   I couldn&#8217;t see clearly more than ten feet in any direction because of sand motes suspended in the air.  On top of this there was a sharp, dry smell, as if from distant fires.  I sensed that the place had seen terrible destruction.  My home feels a little like that right now.</p>
<p>As I write this I&#8217;m sitting at a dust-coated desk, in my dust-filled bedroom, brushing dust off my keyboard, and breathing  dust into my lungs.  I&#8217;m perpetually brushing my clothes and rinsing my hands, unable to feel that they&#8217;re clean.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I expected, demolition was not the dirtiest stage of the remodel.  Demolition produced debris that could be piled up, bagged, and left at the curb.  It&#8217;s the final woodwork, plasterwork, and sanding that has been more difficult to control.  They release a fine dust that clings to every surface and makes it difficult to see from one end of a room the other.  Just as my remodel is reaching completion, I&#8217;m enveloped in a blinding construction fog.</p>
<p>The construction workers have been careful about keeping my furniture covered, sealing off my closets with blue tape, and cleaning the site periodically.  But there might not be no escape from this fine dust, which finds its way behind doors and drop-cloths, into cabinets and storage bins.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fastidious housekeeper.  The ceiling-high piles of debris in my living room after demolition didn&#8217;t bother me so much.  Nor do the footprints on my carpets or the wear on my floors.  But this construction dust is disconcerting because there seems to be no escape from it. Looking back, I should have sealed off all the floors, furniture, and closets in my apartment very carefully before construction began.  It would have saved me some worry and a whole lot of cleaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-596 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PROJECT-FILES.jpg" alt="PROJECT FILES" width="540" height="606" />When I manage a construction project in an architecture office I am terrifically, annoyingly organized. I respond to phone calls and emails immediately. I keep and file printed copies of all documents I receive and send. I develop filing systems so that all project documents are easy to find.</p>
<p>But when I began my home remodel I seemed to abandon all of these practices. I began with a bang, creating a binder with carefully labeled sections for existing conditions drawings, design sketches, product specifications, and reference images. I carried this binder with me as I shopped for products, packed it in my suitcase when I traveled, and left it on an end table right by my desk, so that I could reach it at any moment.</p>
<p>But before long I had much more information than could be stored in the binder. Piles sprang up around the binder, on top of it and on the floor below, piles of plumbing fixture catalogues, cabinet specifications, and outdated drawings. Eventually tile samples and paint chips found their way into these piles, and then cost estimates and invoices. The piles got higher and started spilling into one another and then into other, unrelated piles in my bedroom, piles of unsorted mail and trashy magazines. As a result there are no real project files for my home remodel project, only project piles.</p>
<p>When working in an office I keep a typed project directory, which lists the contact information for all the contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers on a project, and update the document weekly. For my home remodel I just slipped all the relevant business cards I had collected in a plastic sleeve, although I believe that there are still a few important ones swimming around at the bottom of my purse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-615 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PROJECT-DIRECTORY.jpg" alt="PROJECT DIRECTORY" width="540" height="671" /></p>
<p>Most of my communication with vendors and suppliers was through email, and most of my communication with my contractor Martin and his team was over the phone. Although I prefer email contractors always seem to prefer the phone. (Since my contractor Martin and the site supervisors, Brian and Joe, are Irish, it is always a pleasure to answer the phone and hear their lovely brogues, regardless of what they were actually saying to me.)</p>
<p>There were no scheduled site meetings but almost every morning I met with Brian and Joe and we talked about what work would be done that day and what steps would come next. They followed the drawings carefully but called me whenever they had specific questions. (Which way should the medicine cabinet door open? How thick is the kitchen countertop?) Martin came to the site about once each week, often after work hours, to review progress and discuss the schedule. Because it was a small remodel and a small team, this informal way of working worked well.</p>
<p>That is not the case with my record-keeping. Maybe because this project is so close to me, so personal, I abandoned my office habits and tried to manage it in a less regimental, hands-on way. It&#8217;s not something I would recommend. Keeping good records is the only way to track decisions and costs accurately. For my next remodel project, I&#8217;ll be sure to bring a more professional attitude to doing filing and paperwork.</p>

The two site supervisors, Brian and Joe, arrived with their team one Monday morning at 9:00, as scheduled, and before lunchtime they had cleared all the fixtures and appliances from my kitchen and bathroom.  All that remained to do was tear out the floor and wall tiles, and before Tuesday afternoon they had finished that.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-573 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/BATH-03.jpg" alt="BATH 03" width="540" height="742" /></p>
<p>It was startling to see these two rooms, which I had used for eight years and knew so intimately, suddenly disappear.  Objects  that had seemed like fixed realities of my daily life (my rusting medicine cabinet, my noisy fridge, my perpetually clogged sink) were very simply removed and discarded.  It made me understand that interior design is an ephemeral art.  No doubt years from now I, or someone else, will be ripping out the appliances and finishes I&#8217;m installing now for altogether newer and more fabulous ones.</p>
<p>After demolition was complete I expected that some fundamental character of these rooms would be revealed, that I would be able see their proportions and dimensions more clearly.  But demolition made it even harder to see the rooms platonically, as empty spaces ready to be fitted out.  It exposed their gritty structure and infrastructure.  Behind the tile wainscot in the bathroom there were chaotic layers of cement blocks, mortar, plaster and lathe.  Behind drywall in the kitchen there were  overlapping plumbing, electrical and vent lines, and a rough infill of cement block and plaster.<img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-561 mt-24 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/KITCHEN-DETAIL.jpg" alt="KITCHEN DETAIL" width="540" height="421" /> Demolition did not inspire my faith; it did not excite me.  It exposed the rough, unpretty stuff that my building was made of, and the dense maze of existing utility lines.  So much of the wall behind my kitchen sink had been removed to squeeze in new plumbing and drain lines that I wondered whether it might fall over.  And, for just a moment, I wondered seriously why I had begun to remodel.</p>

<p>Just the way in which the four contractors submitted their bids was revealing. Only two contractors submitted a bit on the date I had requested.  One actually submitted his three weeks afterwards, apologizing that he had been out of the country.  All of the bids were sent via email.  Most were in PDF format but one was entirely written within the body of the email in a florid, bright blue font.  One bid arrived from an email address that I didn&#8217;t recognize; the contractor had asked his wife to type up his estimate and she had sent it to me from her personal email account.</p>
<p>All the contractors broke out costs, listing subtotals for different materials and types of work.  But each one broke them costs out in a different way and to a different level of detail.  I&#8217;m certain that each one understood the scope of the work and considered it carefully as he prepared his bid.  But each of the bids itemized work in a different way so that no easy comparison could be made.</p>
<p>For example, all contractors listed &#8220;Electrical Work.&#8221; But Contractor A listed a total price for work in both the bath and kitchen.  Contractor B listed separate prices for work in the bath and the kitchen.  And Contractor C listed the prices to relocate or install each individual outlet, switch, appliance and light fixture.</p>
<p>Of course for each bid the total construction cost was the first number that I saw and the number that stayed with me.  But I wanted to make sure that I was making a fair comparison and made an ExCel spreadsheet, as I would for any other architecture project, confirming that each contractor had included each work item shown in the drawings.  (There is something deeply reassuring to me about using ExCel; it makes me feel entirely grown-up and rational.)  I wrote back to each contractor, asking him to confirm that his price included each item in the scope of work.</p>

<p>In the end, though, I chose a contractor using both my heart and my head.  This remodel was important to me and that I wanted to work with someone I liked, someone I felt comfortable speaking with, and someone I would be comfortable having inside my home.  So I chose Martin.  He had made the strongest first impression and also submitted a competitive bid.  For me this very important decision was an easy one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-553 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/MYSTERY-DATE.jpg" alt="CONTRACTOR LEADS" width="540" height="402" />The most crucial decision I made in my remodeling project was selecting a general contractor.  The contractor would manage the schedule and budget, maintain the quality of the work, and, along with his or her team, be working inside of my home for several weeks.</p>
<p>To help make such an important decision, a decision that more and more homeowners are faced with, there just aren&#8217;t good resources to turn to.  Unlike finding a plumber to unclog the sink or a roofer to fix a leak, it doesn&#8217;t feel right to turn to Yellow Page listings, retailer recommendations, or even word of mouth to find a contractor to remodel your home.  There&#8217;s too much money and time involved and too much that could go wrong.  That&#8217;s one reason I&#8217;m excited about Swee10, because it brings homeowners a reliable database of local contractors, with details about their experience and photos of completed projects.  And it gives contractors a chance to review drawings and photos or remodel projects to find ones that would be right for them.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m an architect I was able reach out to colleagues who specialized in residential work for references. I gathered contact information for four contractors who had worked successfully with colleagues on small-scale remodels similar to my own.  This gave me confidence that I could not make the &#8220;wrong&#8221; decision, that no matter which contractor I selected, they would complete the work responsibly.</p>
<p>But meeting each of the contractors, who were all men, was a little bit like playing &#8220;Mystery Date.&#8221;  I mailed each one drawings of the new kitchen and bathroom design and a stack of product specifications.  Then I met each of them individually to show them through my apartment.  Although I interviewed them carefully I was most strongly impressed by their personalities, by who they were as men rather than contractors.  In the end it was their character rather than anything in particular they said regarding the remodel work that mattered most.</p>
<p>I liked all the contractors I met.  Each one was punctual and courteous, and articulate and knowledgeable about residential interior work.  But there were some red flags.  One man had a bearish, paternal, Old World sort of personality.  He continually bragged about his accomplishments, both personal and professional.  And he continually told me what I wanted to do.  &#8220;YOU WANT a stone shelf in the bathroom,&#8221; and &#8220;YOU WANT a glass tile backsplash.&#8221; What I really wanted to do was respond, &#8220;Well, actually, I&#8217;m an architect and what I want is what I&#8217;ve shown in the drawings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another contractor was at the opposite end of the confidence scale.  He was painfully reserved and careful not to offend.  He nodded his head in agreement to all that I said but revealed little of what he thought until I asked him outright.  It seemed as if it would be difficult for him to face problems directly or deliver bad news, as contractors are sometimes required to do.</p>
<p>When I met Martin, the contractor I am working with now, he impressed me with a balance of pragmatism and idealism.  He spoke freely and also listened. He had reviewed the drawings beforehand, but referenced details and products he had used in other projects to make suggestions.</p>
<p>In addition Martin is married to my friend Kristin, a warm and wonderful person.  I liked him automatically, irrationally, by association.  Although the conventional wisdom is that one should not do business with friends I felt that in this case it really didn&#8217;t apply.  I called an architect that Martin had worked with before and received an excellent recommendation. Although I still needed to review bids from all the contractors, I had a hunch that I would be working with Martin.</p>
