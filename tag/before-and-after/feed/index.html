<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Overhaul a dated bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The homeowner’s bathroom was long due for a renovation. It needed all new tiling work and fixtures to make it more functional and to align with the homeowner’s clean aesthetic. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which also included another bathroom, bedroom updates, and building of a new closet) to Sweeten. She was</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4616"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take on the renovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="green-bathroom-beige-tiles"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48802 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Elisabeth-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Green bathroom with beige tiles and towel rod before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Elisabeth-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Elisabeth-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Elisabeth-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While keeping the same floorplan, the bathroom got a complete makeover. The majority of fixtures were selected in a bright white for a clean look. Black and white tile floor ties the space together and adds an unexpected pop of pattern.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Create a simple “age-in-place” bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sheryl bought her apartment 15 years ago, and the bathroom showed it. She wanted to be able to stay in the apartment for the long run and felt it was the time to update the bathroom not only to make it safer but also to modernize it. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/24127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also including her kitchen) to Sweeten and was </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-brown-vanity"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48804 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sheryl-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white bathtub and brown vanity before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sheryl-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sheryl-Bathroom-Before-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sheryl-Bathroom-Before-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Tile transforms the space, from the classic basket weave flooring to the traditional subway tile that surrounds the combined shower and bathtub. A new comfort-height toilet meets the “age-in-place” requirements Sheryl wanted, though she was restricted by co-op rules in installing a step-in shower. She decided to install a lower, 14-inch bathtub instead. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40243 mb-0 size-full" title="vanity-with-undermount-porcelain-sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-02.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity with undermount porcelain sink and mirror and white tiles on half walls and gray walls and bathtub with a window and floor tiles after renovation" width="2800" height="4200" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-02.jpg 2800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Optimize a bathroom for four people</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Pink tile, poor lighting, and an old pedestal sink—that was the state of Fatima and Scott’s bathroom when they bought their apartment. Before they moved in (and before the arrival of their second child), they decided a renovation was in order. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32491">posted their project to Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4894">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48805 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fatima-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with white bathtub and white pedestal sink before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fatima-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fatima-Bathroom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fatima-Bathroom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The renovation resulted in a modern but warm space thanks to the mix of traditional materials, like the subway tile wall, faux Carrara floor, and vanity. It functions perfectly for adults and kids, with storage for bath toys, dimmable lighting, and a Bluetooth device for in-shower music.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Reimagine a dated kitchen in the East Village</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: The homeowner bought an 860-square-foot apartment on the east side of Manhattan with the plan to renovate before moving in. He wanted the kitchen to be open to the rest of the apartment and give it a more contemporary look and feel. Functionally, the layout wasn’t working for him. The sink was small and in a strange location, and the stove and refrigerator were right next to each other. Cosmetically, the pine cabinets looked behind the times, as did the tile flooring and countertops. Ready to dive in, he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project to Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38747 mb-0 size-full" title="oak-kitchen-cabinets-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets and square tiles on floor and granite countertop and stainless steel appliances before renovation" width="1084" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04.jpg 1084w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-Before-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>After</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal. The dividing wall between the kitchen and family room came down and a custom unit with storage on both sides took its place. On the kitchen side, it hosts the integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator, while the other side holds pantry items and other essentials. Full-sized and quality appliances were a big priority. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>

Light gray lower cabinets contrasting with white uppers give the illusion of a higher ceiling. The homeowner opted for white quartz countertops and bamboo floors, an eco-friendly and durable option that’s easy to maintain and refinish when needed.</p>
<p>His contractor came across a few issues, including an immovable gas line. He worked around it, adding additional cabinets and storage space. The contractor also discovered the apartment couldn’t contain heat. “They adapted their design incorporating larger replacement radiators which are keeping the space nice and toasty as winter is approaching,” the homeowner shared. Because of the building’s age, there were cracks in the living room and bedroom walls, so the contractor repaired them and gave the homeowner a longer-term warranty. “They also skim-coated the entire place because the ceilings and walls were in bad shape.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-04.gif"><img decoding="async" title="gray-corner-cabinets-with-doors" class="alignnone wp-image-38732 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-David-Quaid-Apt-04.gif" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets and light gray under counter cabinets with white countertop and gray backsplash tiles and hardwood floors and flush mounted light after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Another key (but hidden!) element of the entire home included installing voice-control lighting. In the kitchen specifically, the homeowner can control the undercabinet and overhead lighting all with the sound of his voice.</p>
<p>“The team did everything very well, but the thing that has impressed me the most has been their commitment to getting everything right, even when minor surprises have come up months after I moved in, and long after I&#8217;d submitted my final payment,” he shared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Chilling scenes transform to happy ever afters</h2>
<p>In the renovation world, nothing is more satisfying than witnessing the evolution of a dark “before” into a dream-come-true space. These kitchens and baths started out as unwelcoming, dated, and in some cases, unfunctional rooms. With help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, they took a complete 360°.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30869 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom-Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovating a home, renovation, remodel, home, design, construction " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<p>Even the homeowner, Kristen, recognized the fear-factor of her studio bathroom. “The shower and tub had gotten a little scary,” she said. Already dark due to a lack of windows, the floor-to-ceiling slate tile certainly wasn’t helping matters. Building regulations prevented plumbing reconfiguration, but the cosmetic changes, from fresh paint to new fixtures, were more than enough to transform the space.</p>

<em>(Above)</em> A Prospect Heights <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/">kitchen</a></p>
<p>This co-op kitchen hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s—and it showed. The mismatched walls, dated cabinets, and overhead lighting gave the space an eerie vibe that called for a full gut renovation. The limited counter space (only 24 square inches!) and cabinets were swapped for floor-to-ceiling white cabinets, updated appliances, and quartz countertops.</p>

<em>(Above)</em> A Westchester<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-simplicity-in-a-pelham-kitchen/"> kitchen</a></p>
<p>Both form and function were lost on this townhouse kitchen. The vinyl flooring, beige countertops, and dark brown cabinets were straight out of a ‘70s nightmare, not to mention many of the appliances didn’t even work. Eager to get it in functioning condition, these renovators gave the kitchen a much-needed facelift with new shaker cabinets, a slate tile floor, and most importantly, brand new appliances.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29860 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath-Before04-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, remodel, home, design, construction " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<em>(Above)</em> A Park Slope<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-old-bath-gets-investment-ready/"> bathroom</a></p>
<p>The pink tile and overall decrepit bathroom didn’t dissuade Matt from buying his home. It did, however, lead to a complete remodel. He wanted a clean, neutral space that he and potential future subletters or owners could also enjoy. A walk-in shower and modern floating vanity brought in a modern yet classic sensibility.</p>

<em>(Above)</em> An East Flatbush<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-reno-for-the-love-of-cooking/"> kitchen</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Tortured&#8221; was the best way to describe the kitchen in an East Flatbush rowhouse. The dropped ceiling and dark paneling could make anyone who dared to enter feel trapped. The renovators saw the potential and moved forward in creating a chef-worthy kitchen designed for entertaining.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our double issue to celebrate the long holiday weekend! Below, you will find posts that represent our greatest home renovation hits featuring some of our readers&#8217; most favorite kitchen, bathroom, and entire home renos on our blog and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. Each homeowner came to Sweeten for help and after the project was complete took the time to share their renovation journeys with us—and you. We’re out scouting new projects next week, and will be back in full swing with the next newsletter the following week. Have a great 4th!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;"><strong>SWEETEN KITCHEN: MOST READ POST ON THE BLOG</strong></span><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23095 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam and Sean’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam and Sean’s transformation of an outdated, cookie-cutter kitchen in their Clinton Hill home got a lot of attention on our blog. Taking down a few walls opened up the space, making the room feel larger and brighter. Mix-and-match countertops create a customized look, pairing Caesarstone in Frosty Carrina with butcher block for the top of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank">peninsula</a>. Plus, graphite cabinets are a welcome departure from more neutral shades with bronze knobs for contrast. We also think our readers loved this post because Sam finished the renovation while pregnant with child number three!</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</a> got 4,104 likes and 17 comments</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina, who happens to be an architect, drew up a new future for her kitchen; taking down walls, expanding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank">storage</a>, and devising a color scheme that would really pop. New cabinets were painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore, a bold move that adds character and charm. For a striking contrast, the white subway tile backsplash and countertops—another appearance of Frosty Carrina quartz by Caesarstone—keep the space feeling bright and make it easy to understand why it was such a hit with our followers!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">SWEETEN BATHROOM: MOST READ POST ON THE BLOG</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24182 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x1084.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s renovation made her home feel like a different world altogether with a unique take on the modern bath that resonated with our readers. Needing serious updates, her bath received a new toilet, tub, sink, fixtures, vanity, tiles, and flooring. Porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floor tile</a> with a faux-wood finish adds warmth and character while white subway tile lends a classic look. Rima wanted the bathroom to feel modern and have plenty of storage made possible by a two-drawer vanity, plus wall and medicine cabinets.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> got 4,783 likes and 25 comments</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben wanted a fresh and modern bath—like so many of our followers—so they planned on keeping it minimalist. A black hexagon floor tile with bright white grout adds a lot of visual interest while an inventive side-table-turned-vanity brings a touch of warmth and rustic charm. Plus, double medicine cabinets provide lots of sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank">storage</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s impossibly charming studio is a marriage of modern and cozy and garnered the attention of our readers as well as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Looking to create a clean, fresh, and calm feel, Lauren set out on a complete home renovation. The studio apartment especially needed help with storage since the larger closet had been converted into a small office by the previous tenant. Our favorite update: two closet makeovers that allowed Lauren to optimize her storage, making plenty of room for a serious shoe collection. Plus, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinished</a> wood floors got a darker shade that changed the tone of the room, adding richness and a level of sophistication.</span></p>

A slim corner sink and medicine cabinet in the bathroom, plus white subway tile, transform a once dark and cramped space into a relaxing retreat.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">A developer&#8217;s dark style is transformed by its new owner with high-gloss cabinets, drawers turned sideways, and a comfy window seat</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="window seat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-Portrait-723x1085.jpg" alt="window seat" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redesign a kitchen</a> with a bright sheen in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: There was much to love about the two-bedroom condo in Bed-Stuy that Ursula, a math teacher, recently purchased. The developer, who had just converted a brownstone into four apartments, did a good job. However, the brand new kitchen just wasn’t her style. The dark mahogany cabinets and kitchen island weighed it down as did the floorboards of a similar color. The cabinets above the range also gave the space a claustrophobic feel. “The developer seemed to have an imagination when it came to painting. The walls were blue and yellow and very specific to his taste,” said Ursula.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: Since her new apartment only has windows on the front and back, Ursula used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s1">a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to </span>tap her Sweeten contractor and harness that light. So out went the dark cabinets. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood floors</a> were stripped and restained. To open up the kitchen, the cabinets and microwave above the range were out, too (“it just isn’t a pretty appliance,” said Ursula, speaking of microwaves). In their place is now a sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a>. With the space more open, the hexagonal tiles chosen for the backsplash became a focal point. “I think it must be the math teacher in me, but there is just something about them that I love,” she said. A &#8220;dresser&#8221;-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">island</a> features three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and some pots and pans. &#8220;My beech cutting board is always on top of the kitchen island for food prep,&#8221; says Ursula. &#8220;It is conveniently in front of the oven, so I just have to turn around to cook.&#8221; The storage unit&#8217;s glossy gray tone offers contrast to the mostly white space. Her Sweeten contractor also utilized every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinet space</a> including a stubborn area next to the oven. There, a drawer installed on its side—a cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit—became a convenient <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull-out spice rack</a>. As for the microwave, a much smaller one is hidden in the upper cabinets.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Ursula&#8217;s Sweeten contractor used the same kitchen cabinet system from Ikea to create a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bench seat</a> near the window. Now, there’s more storage space and extra seating for when guests come over. “That&#8217;s one of my favorite areas in the apartment because it is a little unexpected,” she says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21360 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21362 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21363 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21359 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21410 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-12-1-723x997.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="997" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21356 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This week, we have a full bathroom renovation guest report in from Celeste G., a condo owner and marketing, brand building, and copywriting triple threat in Park Slope. Read on down for Celeste’s debrief on her Brooklyn bathroom before and after!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I purchased my one bedroom condo in Park Slope in 2008. It was new construction, which was great because I am the exact opposite of handy or DIY. The “design” of the apartment was standard for new construction buildings at the time: bamboo floors, limestone tile, and dark cherry cabinetry. I lived in the apartment for a few years before considering any cosmetic changes and around year three, I noticed that the limestone tiles in my bathroom had darkened in some spots. In fact, the tile had never been sealed and as I learned the hard way, limestone is extremely porous. Several failed cleaning experiments later, I had nearly ruined the color and texture of a small patch near the sink vanity. As a clean enthusiast, the sight of the floor drove me bananas, but I wasn’t ready to take on what felt like an overwhelming renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14446" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-01" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom_Before-011-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, I decided to replace all the bamboo floors in my apartment (why start small when practically moving out of your home is an option?!). Luckily this foray into renovation was successful and the change in flooring literally changed the entire look and feel of the whole place. I felt confident tackling my tiny bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did some research on what I might spend (why are toilets so expensive???) and asked my friends for contractor recommendations. My building required contractors with a certain amount of insurance, so I started looking beyond friend recommendations and luckily landed on Sweeten. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a> and was matched with three contractors including <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a>. All I knew for sure was that I liked the idea of a gray/black/white graphical floor, and I definitely needed more storage space because clutter makes my eyes swim &#8212; during our first meeting, I felt that Paulina understood the general aesthetic I was interested in and suggested a number of possibilities to open up the small-ish space. I sent her a few pictures from Pinterest and she developed 3D models based on my bathroom’s measurements. For someone spatially challenged, the modeling was enormously helpful. I could see the transformation and make adjustments before touching a thing. For example, we initially thought gold hardware would elevate the bathroom’s overall look but once I saw it in the model, I opted to go with chrome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we were decided on the 3D model, Paulina sourced floor and wall samples and sent me a photo of the type of wood planned for a custom vanity. I presented a lot of options to her and relied on her expertise for guidance. For example, a friend of mine replaced her bathroom sinks with <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corian surfaces</a> and I really liked the seamlessness of it. I shared a photo with Paulina and she designed the sink and vanity with a beautiful, white Corian top, complete with side cutouts to add some dimension and visual interest. Honestly, I was unsure about the cutouts initially but after seeing it in the 3D model, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14447" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-01" width="600" height="890" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-011-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14448" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-021-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main challenge with this bathroom was the lack of storage space. I asked Paulina for a deep medicine cabinet along with a good amount of storage space in the vanity. I got my wish in spades. As we were discussing options, I pointed out that there was no place for a trash bin. Paulina worked it into the design of the vanity so not only do I have space for a small trash bin, it’s also completely hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original inspiration for the renovation was again, the floor. I fell in love with a cement tile in a M.C. Escher-like pattern. Paulina ordered samples for us to review but expressed some second thoughts about the durability and appearance of that tile. Maybe two or three days later, she emailed me to say that she was concerned about this particular pick and suggested I look at some marble tile with a similar pattern at a showroom nearby. I’m so glad I took her up on it. The marble option, from <a href="https://www.walkerzanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walker Zanger</a> (in Facet Ash), was not only more in line with the aesthetic I wanted but also less expensive and more durable. I kept my original tub and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Bathroom-Toilets/category/429984/429204.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler toilet</a>, and framed the room in a new beveled, white subway tile. I kept the walls white and Paulina’s team installed a <a href="https://www.minkagroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minka-Lavery Downtown Edison lighting fixture</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14449" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-031-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two weeks of actual renovation are a blur to me now. They seemed to go by very quickly and yet take forever. I was close enough to check on progress every day and Paulina’s team really did work fast. The transformation was fun to watch, even though I admittedly had a few panicked moments and doubts about the chair rail tile (why do I even know what this is?) and the vanity. I remember one email I sent Paulina after the vanity was installed. I spent maybe 10-15 minutes in the bathroom while it was still under construction trying to get the drawers to the vanity open, and then emailed to ask if the drawers would be easier to open when the bathroom was finished. It didn’t occur to me that the pulls hadn’t been installed yet. Thankfully, Paulina has a good sense of humor…!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few months later and I still love my new bathroom. When I think back to that stained limestone tile and cherry wood vanity, I can’t believe it took me seven years to switch it up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Barrin in Carroll Gardens spent 18 years in his three bed / two bath condo before deciding that quick fixes and appliance swaps in the kitchen were no longer cutting it. The kitchen had one giant plus: great space anchored by a gorgeous original cedar beam. The minuses? Formica counters and peeling particle board cabinetry struggling mightily to make it to a third decade. After a microwave grease fire during his first years in the condo, a few appliance replacements here and there, and some cosmetic work on the floors, Barrin was ready for the apartment&#8217;s first real kitchen renovation. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and we brought <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> in to revive this kitchen and bring back its simpler industrial roots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-and-after/before-after-barrins-carroll-gardens-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13344 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b.png" alt="SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-00-cover-b-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-13249"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like many other buildings in Carroll Gardens and neighboring Red Hook, the condos had been converted from a former factory with lots of loft-space and exposed wood awesomeness. Barrin and Evros went bottom to top to create more storage and keep the architectural details at center stage. The kitchen floor had black granite tiles installed by a previous owner with renters, and the cabinets leftover from the factory&#8217;s conversion were builder-grade. The drawers didn&#8217;t have any of the full extension glide that more modern construction routinely offers, which limited accessible drawer space by 30%. And while so many NYC kitchens are relegated to just one or two walls (or a galley at best), this room&#8217;s full size needed more thoughtful corner cabinetry and some help re-thinking an outdated partition by the entry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13252" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1.jpg" alt="large-1" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/large-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barrin looked to the ceiling for inspiration with the floors, choosing sturdy porcelain tiles in a light, woodgrain finish to align with the flow of the exposed wood planks. The cabinets presented multiple challenges: Barrin originally eyed IKEA for cost-saving cabinets, but the kitchen&#8217;s ducts and corners made it difficult to go with standard sizes. Barrin chose a white Shaker semi-custom option, ordering cabinet bases from a dealer and creating custom doors and alterations. Barrin found the neutral granite countertops at a local stone yard in Brooklyn &#8212; as the plans came together, he considered a black or charcoal gray stone for contrast, but ended up deciding that the natural brown and ivory tones in the granite would better complement the kitchen&#8217;s wood features.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13260" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-07.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-07" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-07-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13261" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-08.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-08" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SWEETEN_BarrinKitchen-08-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros&#8217;s team removed the partition that sectioned off the kitchen&#8217;s entry and extended the double-height countertop to wrap around and accommodate counter-height food prep and bar-height meals. Expanded storage under the counter allowed Evros to tailor one section for Barrin&#8217;s cookbooks and build out corner storage for bulkier appliances like roasting pans and a food processor. Look closely for a Sweeten blog first: most of the electrical outlets are hidden under cabinets, but the handful that do interrupt the backsplash are dual electrical outlets and USB ports. Electrical outlets + USB ports = yes! I feel silly for not realizing this was a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros also relocated the sink from a central point and moved it to the right to open up more prep area near the stove. Barrin chose a glass tile backsplash, alternating clear glass with a painted base and buffed glass in the same green hue &#8211; a smart way to bring texture and a little bit of gloss in without adding more color. A slim, <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/products/profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 inch GE fridge</a>, a <a href="https://www.miele.com/en/com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miele dishwasher</a> with three internal drawers, <a href="https://www.hansgrohe-usa.com/18865.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hansgrohe faucet fixtures</a>, and <a href="https://www.kohlercompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler sink</a> round out the best of the new appliances. Barrin loves the combination of under-cabinet lighting, sleeker LED track lighting, and blue glass pendants from Manhattan Lights &#8211; all dimmable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you, Barrin, for this tour! Bravo to you and your expert team for this beautiful transformation!</p>
