			<h2>Let your fridge blend neatly into its surroundings with these paneling ideas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44899 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you notice in a kitchen is the refrigerator. It is big and usually holds souvenir magnets, wedding invitations, or to-do lists. With more homes featuring open-plan layouts, their size and boxy shape interfere with the visual harmony. </span>Paneling and built-ins help disguise a hidden fridge cabinet by integrating it with cabinetry. The look of the entire kitchen is unified.</p>
<p><span class="s1">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he homeowners below pulled off the ever-popular &#8220;refrigerator in cabinet&#8221; design trend with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help of their general contractors</a> from Sweeten. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A designer seeks visual harmony</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Furniture designer, Mitzie and her partner, Jenifer, chose blue and white for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a>. The entire space was simplified and unified from what it had been—outdated with a variety of closets. After laying out mood boards and careful planning, a more pleasant transition was created since it opened to the living space. While the <span class="s2">hidden fridge cabinet</span> blends in with the kitchen cabinetry, two symmetrical closets flank the main kitchen—one is a closet, and the other hides the washer and dryer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compact size with a hidden fridge cabinet</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">After renovating all of the rental units in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone they purchased</a>, Janet and Jerry kept the 600-square-foot top unit as a pied-à-terre. Scandinavian minimalism and California casualness meant the sight lines throughout the home would have few vertical disruptions. This would apply to the kitchen too. To emphasize the open and airy studio, they hid all appliances in cabinets. The washer/dryer combo, refrigerator, and pull-out freezer all fit under the countertop.</p>
<h3>A custom touch for a fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinets with waterfall island and brown cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56511" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Hampton kitchen</a>, homeowners Jennifer and Alex wanted to keep the redesign simple but inviting. They chose to add a large island for entertaining and splurged on a wine fridge and quartz countertops. To make the design more modern, they decided to install an integrated refrigerator, which streamlined the look of the cabinetry.</span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet finds a niche<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986" title="paneled fridge nestled within a column" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="refrigerator paneling" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ainsley and Simon’s architect discovered that the column in the kitchen was merely decorative, they came up with a plan </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tuck the refrigerator inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it and add custom panels. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” Ainsley said</span><b>.</b></p>
<h3>A seamless built-in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-full" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s front door led </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly into the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She had to choose between a traditional entryway or a hybrid space that would add square footage to the kitchen. She chose the latter and added a seamless wall of cabinetry featuring a refrigerator in a cabinet, plus a pantry and a coat closet.</span></p>
<h3>A wall of closets<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in kitchen with white built ins" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48230" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the flow between their living and kitchen space, Tara and Brian’s contractor came up with an idea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the refrigerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a wall already outfitted with closets. Now the refrigerator fits right in with the cabinetry, instead of jutting out in the main cooking space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46413 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Post a Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet around a structural column</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22901" title="white-long-cabinets-long-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" alt="white long cabinets with long steel handles diving white living room with open book shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey and Kumar’s apartment is full of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clever storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize their limited space. The kitchen is one such example thanks to creative built-ins. Custom cabinetry covers the refrigerator along with a neighboring pantry, while the entire unit conceals a structural column.</span></p>
<h3>A clever closet-turned-fridge idea</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scandinavian chic was the look that homeowners Roxana and Gabriel were going for in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/">Long Island City loft</a>.  They turned to a Sweeten contractor who was able to update their space to match their minimalistic style. </span><span class="s1">The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size appliance and custom cut the Ikea panels to fit.  </span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet unifies the kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal for this Manhattan couple. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took down the dividing wall</a> between the kitchen and family room and replaced it with a custom unit with storage on both sides. It was really important to the couple that they fit a fully integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator and other standard-sized appliances. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>
<h3>A puzzle of panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40347" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less like appliances, more like furniture—that was Sally’s directive for her kitchen renovation. Her contractor built out a wall of cabinets to hide <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the refrigerator</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pantry. A set of narrow units were designed to hold brooms and mops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen</a> or home remodel, discuss with your Sweeten contractor how to incorporate a seamless kitchen.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make your fridge look like a cabinet</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are several ways to make your fridge look like a cabinet. One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet–about 24 inches–which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.</p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.</p>

<h3>Ceramic glass <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/wolf/cooktops-and-rangetops/induction-cooktops/30-inch-contemporary-induction-cooktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a> from Wolf</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you like to cook? Do you like to prepare gourmet meals? Do you entertain frequently? Are you in a hurry to get dinner on the table? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, you might want to check out one of the hottest “new” entries into home cooking today: the induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this type of cooking was first introduced to the U.S. about 70 years ago, it is enjoying a surge in popularity, thanks to a couple of factors. A growing demand for this appliance has lowered prices. You can find some models for under $1,000, or as much as a third of what they once cost. The smooth cooking surface answers the demands of another trend: a sleek, uncluttered kitchen. Finally, the precision and speed of induction cooking draws Americans who are increasingly strapped for time at home and welcome the opportunity to cut even minutes from meal prep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, unpacks the many features of induction to help you better understand what’s available and noteworthy.</p>
<h3>What is induction?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction is a method of producing heat for cooking. It works by creating an interaction between a metal pot or pan and an electromagnetic field below the tempered glass surface of the cooktop to heat the cookware. Induction is the only method that directly uses the cookware as a part of the cooking system.</p>
<h3>How does induction work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beneath the surface—ceramic or tempered glass—of an induction cooktop rests an induction coil. When the coil is activated (by turning on its control knob or pad), an electrical current passes through this coil, creating an electromagnetic field of energy. Upon contact with that field, the iron molecules in the pan begin to vibrate. It is the friction between those molecules that heats the cookware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooktop surface itself does not emit heat. Rather, heat is produced only when it is turned on and a pan makes contact with the cooktop surface. Once the pan is removed from the cooktop, the magnetic connection is broken and heat is no longer generated. Before the pan makes contact, the cooktop surface, even when it’s been turned on, will remain cool. After the pan is removed from the cooktop, the surface will be warm, but not hot to the touch.</p>
<h3>How does induction differ from other heating sources?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike gas or radiant <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooktops</a>, there is no exposed flame or coil. If you turn on an induction cooktop, it generates no heat until the appropriate cookware is placed in contact with it. Also, the heat is contained within the circumference of the pan or cooktop. As a result, less energy is generated and wasted because the heat is created only within the pan, and not in the surrounding environment.</p>
<h3>Are there distinct benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, all cooktops are not alike. While any heat source will cook food, and cook it well, induction does have standout features that include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Safety</b></span> &#8211; The heat happens in the pan, so there’s no danger of accidentally touching a hot cooktop. This is a particular benefit to homes with children or elderly family members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Accuracy</b></span> &#8211; Precision control at very low or high heat lets the cooktop maintain a temperature to melt chocolate, simmer a cream sauce, or boil pasta water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Speed</b></span> &#8211; The electromagnetic field below the glass cooktop surface quickly generates heat directly to the pan, so water boils faster—manufacturers claim a quart of water boils in less than two minutes—than with gas or radiant heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Energy efficiency</b></span> &#8211; Heat occurs only within the pan where it makes contact with the cooktop, so there’s no energy wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Easy cleaning</b></span> &#8211; A smooth, continuous surface means no crannies where food can catch, and because most of the cooktop stays cool when you’re cooking, spills don’t burn on.</p>
<h3>What else is noteworthy?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique cooking function—that electromagnetic field—lends itself to lots of interesting options. For instance, most manufacturers make cooktops with multiple cooking zones that can be bridged to create larger zones for, say, a roasting pan or a Dutch oven. Gaggenau’s induction cooktop makes possible the free positioning of cookware within its combined cooking areas. Thermador offers a memory feature that transfers power settings to another cooking area when the pot is relocated. BlueStar, in addition to a warming burner at 150 degrees, has a Power Boost feature—a 5,500-watt burner that claims to bring one gallon of water in a large pot to a rolling boil in only three and half minutes. Previously, induction wasn’t so good for wok cooking because the coil element couldn’t make contact with enough of the wok’s raised surface. Jenn-Air makes an induction wok module for just that purpose.</p>
<h3>What about installation or replacement?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooktops are made to the same dimensions as comparable gas or radiant cooktops—24, 30, 36, and 48 inches. So you can replace your existing cooktop with an induction version of the same dimensions as long as you have an electrical hookup of the same voltage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to install an induction cooktop over a wall oven, it’s best done with both appliances from the same manufacturer. However, you will want to consult with your contractor and review the installation instructions to make sure they are compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most manufacturers that make induction cooktops will also offer ranges with the induction cooktop option.</p>
<h3>Is special cookware required?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooking requires ferromagnetic cookware or pots and pans with an iron core, which allows the transfer of energy to the pan. Your cast iron pieces and most stainless steel should work fine. Hold a magnet to the bottom of the pan; if it sticks, it will work. Glass and other non-metallic items will not, however, since they lack the iron core and will need to be replaced if you opt-in for this type of cooktop.</p>
<h3>How about care and maintenance?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the unused areas of an induction cooktop remain cool while you are cooking, most spills and splatters will not cook onto the surface. The exception can be foods with sugar content, such as sauces or sweet potatoes. It’s sensible to wipe up any spills quickly with a sponge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The smooth, continuous surface makes it easy to maintain and keep it looking new—far easier than a gas model with its contours and grates, or radiant, unless it is topped with tempered glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only use a cleaner made for your cooktop. A regular glass cleaner with ammonia will mar the surface. Also, always lift a pot when you transfer it; never slide cookware, as this can scratch the cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these features add up to lots of choice for the home cook. With so much selection and specialization, where do you begin? When shopping for induction, ask for demonstrations. Many showrooms offer cooking classes so you can try your hand at induction cooking. After all, who doesn’t want a little romance before making a commitment?</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s a primer on this traditional appliance, but don’t be fooled—telescopic racks, smart technology, and French doors make it a modern kitchen helper</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A wall oven is a very handy appliance in the kitchen, even if you already have one in your range. It doubles your ability to bake, broil or roast, especially important if you entertain frequently, like to cook ahead, or just want to host the holidays with more ease. What’s more, with a wall oven, you enjoy more flexibility with regard to placement, not only for its location in the cook space, but also height.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Wall ovens have seen a lot of advances since the last time you shopped. While you can anticipate the one you choose will operate more accurately and efficiently than previous models, you can also expect to find super-sleek styling, sophisticated digital controls to help you find just the right setting for everything, and of course, self-cleaning. Here’s a rundown of what to look for:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose your heat source</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Probably your first decision will be gas or electric. Your choice will be based on the type of power you already have in your home. Most manufacturers still offer gas, which provides a lower-priced alternative to electric, and more of a moist heat. With electric, the temperature coming from the coils can be controlled more precisely than a gas flame, and heat is radiated from both top and bottom elements. Electric ovens may also offer Sabbath mode, which allows continuous, safe operation over several days without having to turn the appliance off and on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple sizes offer flexibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re replacing an existing oven and so locked into specific dimensions, you have some flexibility here, too. While the most common width is 30 inches, many manufacturers offer 27-inch and 36-inch wall ovens, and you will find some at 24 inches as well as 48. Think about what and how you cook, as you need to consider the cubic-foot capacity, too. If you host the family Thanksgiving, you want an oven cavity large enough to handle that huge turkey. Sizes range from as low as 2 to as high as 5 cubic feet with an average about 4 cubic feet. A large turkey usually ranges from 24 to 26 lbs and can fit into a 30&#8243; oven with 5 cubic feet of interior space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go convection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Available in both gas and electric, a convection oven uses fans to circulate hot air within the oven cavity for faster baking and roasting, as well as the most even cooking. Your wall oven should be able to alternate between conventional and convection, as you wish, but some double ovens may offer one unit convection and the other conventional.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t forgo convenience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Who doesn’t want a microwave oven, even if it’s just for reheating soup or coffee? If space is an issue in your kitchen, consider a wall oven that includes a separate microwave, typically on top. It resembles a double wall oven, but not so tall.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking on the double</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the ’70s, it seemed every kitchen (at least those on TV shows) had double wall ovens and a matching cooktop in avocado or harvest gold. While these color choices have been replaced by stainless steel or a return to classic white or ivory, the convenience of double ovens is worth examining. You get double the function, as mentioned above; while a single convection oven lets you cook simultaneously on multiple racks, a double oven permits simultaneous operation at different temperatures (great when you want the roasted Brussels sprouts to be ready at the same time as the broiled chicken, or to have a pie come out of the oven just as you are finishing dinner). It’s also cheaper than two individual wall ovens (unless you have, say, a kosher kitchen and need to keep the ovens in separate places). Just be sure to plan an adequate landing surface nearby to handle multiple hot dishes that may be ready at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay low-maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What did we do before self-cleaning came along? Perhaps this is where the term “elbow grease” originated. In the past, you had to remove the racks and clean them by hand. Check with your salesperson, as some models now allow you to leave the racks inside while cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warming selection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The warming drawer option first came on strong about 20 years ago, then interest tapered off as wall ovens hit the market with super-low heat and steam features that basically did the same thing. For households where family members eat at different times, or who often host a crowd, and for kosher kitchens, a warming drawer is still a handy appliance worth making room for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other fun features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Bells and whistles come at a price, but you may want to justify it for the added convenience, control, and safety (not to mention time) you gain. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Operation modes have expanded beyond self-cleaning to control lock, as well as delay start and cook and hold—terrific for busy lifestyles! Even the broil function offers some variability to adjust for foods with different requirements, like the golden brown bread crumb topping or the blackened seasoned sirloin steak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Doors are making a statement, too. You’re used to grabbing the handle at the top and peering in while you dodge a blast of hot air to check the progress of your food, right? Manufacturers have responded to this practice by offering larger viewing windows. You can also find wall ovens where the door opens from the side, as well as French doors. A stylistic choice, they’re also ADA compliant, so you may also find it easier to access a dish inside with one of these types of doors (expect to pay a bit more).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Investigate the racking systems. You’ll hear a term “telescopic,” which refers to a system whereby the rack extends fully with ball-bearing rack guides, to prevent tipping when removing heavy items.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">For an even more functional and flexible cook space, why not take inspiration from the past and pair your new wall oven with a cooktop?
