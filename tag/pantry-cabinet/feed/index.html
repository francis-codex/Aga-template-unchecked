										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pre-fab cabinetry—like a pantry cabinet from IKEA—can be a simple way to fulfill the kitchen renovation ideas you’ve been dreaming about</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning your new kitchen design is an exciting time. It’s fun to walk through a big-box store like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, or <a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and start brainstorming the look and feel of your space. These types of stores offer pretty much everything you need to build your kitchen, from cabinets and countertops to appliances, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucets</a>, sinks, and more. Even if you’re choosing to design and sketch out your own kitchen renovation ideas from scratch, it’s good to know what’s out there. Below are five examples of Sweeten kitchens that feature IKEA products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25466 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, pantry cabinet, countertop, sink, and oven range</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a contemporary design that would mesh well with the original molding and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in their new home, Jerry and Janet chose <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base cabinetry</a>—and a tall pantry cabinet—with molding from IKEA. To give them a modern edge, they had them painted in Balboa Mist and Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore. The gray tones were then incorporated into the design of their geometric backsplash tile and contrasted by a white countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25467 size-chrono" title="range, hood, cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25468 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Ursula</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, island, and hood</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ursula transformed a dark kitchen that lacked windows into a lighter and brighter space by incorporating white cabinets with a high-gloss finish. Since the kitchen didn’t offer much in the way of prep space, she implemented a few clever kitchen renovation ideas with an island from IKEA that resembles a dresser and went for a dusky shade of gray to add some contrast. Stainless steel appliances completed the look, including a super sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> that reflects the light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25469 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Fabio and Melina</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a narrow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> that hadn’t been touched in 40 years, Fabio and Melina set out to design a whole new space that matched their personal tastes. They chose black cabinets to cement their strong point of view and included a few glass-fronted doors. A white countertop adds the perfect amount of contrast while a patterned floor tile helps tie the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25470 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Laura and Matthew</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet, and microwave</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Matthew realized that the original cabinets in their new home had been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted</a> several times over and couldn’t be salvaged, so they purchased all new cabinets in a soft shade of gray. They also found a stainless steel microwave at IKEA that matched the look of their new range for a crisp, uniform appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25471 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregg and Kelly</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With two windows nestled in shadowy nooks and dark cabinets in the existing kitchen, Gregg and Kelly knew that they wanted it to feel as light and airy as possible. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knocking down walls</a> filled the space with natural light, and white, high-gloss cabinets with flat front doors brightened up the kitchen even more. Honed black granite countertops provide a pop of contrast against the white backdrop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Here&#8217;s how to max out your cook space from corner unit to pantry cabinet</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20751 size-chrono" title="Kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="Kitchen cabinets" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></span>Laura and Matthew&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank">kitchen renovation</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabinets typically represent a hefty chunk of your kitchen budget—hovering around 30%—so you want to choose carefully. The design you select not only sets the overall style of the room, but also helps to maintain its organization and order. So, how to get all the puzzle pieces—including pull-out shelves and kitchen islands—to fit scoring you the most storage and, hence, efficiency? Consider these factors:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Configurations that magnify storage</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Base cabinets may vary by width and height, but you are still limited by how tall you want your countertop to be. Wall cabinets can go all the way to the ceiling, utilizing even the topmost inches for infrequently used bulk items like paper towels. Combine and arrange the units according to how you operate in your kitchen and what tools or features you use most often. Deep drawers for pots and pans should go near the stove. Shallower drawers for utensils belong with the prep area, along with maybe a pullout cabinet for trash or recycling, and dishes and glassware near the dishwasher—all to minimize steps. Islands are a great place to stow cookware; be sure to allow for clearance of doors and drawers that must be pulled out. You might want to put open shelves on the ends to make way for drawer space in the middle and to avoid doors that can jut out into traffic paths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The advantage of stock versus semi-custom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stock cabinets either come pre-made or require assembly. You can expect a good but limited range of sizes. Semi-custom units offer more choice of dimensions to provide a more exacting fit on your wall space. Semi-custom units typically change in 1-inch increments versus stock’s 3 inches, so there’s less risk of wasted space in a run of cabinets along a wall if you are willing to spend more. Of course, custom cabinets let you get the exact widths you want but expect to wait as much as 10 weeks for shipment versus five to six for semi-custom, and a week or longer for stock. You’ll also pay a heftier price for your one-of-a-kind choices. Read more on pre-fabricated and custom cabinets and how they compare to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">stock items</a>.</p>
<p><b><b>Organize from the Inside Out</b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While planning the configuration of storage, think about internal organization, too. Drawers handle deep pieces like pasta pots and asparagus steamers, and you can access them with the pull of a knob. Alternatively, slide-out metal shelves will let you stow a variety of items in one super-size cabinet, but they can be less-space efficient insofar as they require you to first open a door, and then give up as much as 4 to 6 inches inside to allow for the shelves’ outer frame and rolling mechanism. Think carefully about what you want to put there and how often you need to get at it before making a decision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Special features for versatility and efficiency</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside your cabinets and drawers, you can add optional features that keep the contents tidy and super accessible, such as: organizational inserts for tools and knives; narrow pull out pantry shelves; slats for cookie pans and trays; and even a spring-loaded shelf that swings up and out to lift, say, a heavy mixer. And don’t let that dead space behind the corner cabinet go to waste. Many manufacturers offer Lazy Susans that spin around with the touch of a finger to access the contents on rear shelves. Look, too, for adjustable hooks to hang cookware vertically, so there’s no need to drag everything out to get to that one pesky pot. Some manufacturers offer lighting inside the cabinet box to help locate contents. If you haven’t specified internal organizing features when you ordered the cabinets, you can add them later with metal stacking shelves or hooks found at a home center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>When Fabio and Melina won the bidding war on a two-bedroom Carnegie Hill apartment, they were amazed and delighted. With outdoor space, family-friendly amenities, and just one block from the new Second Avenue subway, it checked off all the right boxes. The only downside: it needed a thorough facelift and the clock was ticking on their rental apartment. Oh, and their baby was due any minute. Here’s how they juggled the ups and downs of renovating, while learning to be new parents—Melina gave birth to their son a month into the project!</i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22047 size-chrono" title="Carnegie Hill renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/L2A9945-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by Carnegie Hill homeowner Melina </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the lease of our functional but tiny, 550 square-foot, one-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side about to end and a baby boy on the way, the time came to try and buy a place. We set our hopes on a two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood, ideally with great light and storage space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fast forward three months into our search and there were still no prospects. We were starting to lose hope! We went to every open house around us and looked at all options. Many of the apartments we visited were too expensive, too small, too dark, or way too far from any subway or daycare, which was our desired childcare plan. That is, until we visited a listing two blocks south of our rental and a block from the entrance of the new Second Avenue subway–whose opening, at the time, still sounded like a dream far in the future. The apartment itself was falling apart and looked straight out of “That ‘70s Show.” Only one family had occupied the home since the building was built 40 years ago, and no renovations had ever been done. Most of its walls were painted green, the living room had an entire wall covered in mirrors, and a popcorn ceiling ran throughout. However, the space was promising. A true two-bedroom on a high floor, with a large balcony off the living room, light (windows in every room!), and closet space. It came with basement storage, a bike room, a children’s playroom in-the-making, and a roof deck. Our only reservation was the need for a full renovation before moving in. Despite that, we made an offer, thinking we wouldn’t win the bidding war anyway. To our surprise, our best and almost unreasonable offer did.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We found Sweeten on an online search and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6445">posted our project </a>to be matched with builders. We were nervous about finding a contractor who could understand our expectations and timing constraints. The lease on our rental was ending before the summer, and so our move-in date was not flexible. We had less than four months to complete our entire renovation project. We chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177">our Sweeten contractor</a> because we immediately felt we could trust him in getting the job done in time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus for our renovation was the kitchen and bathroom. Fabio and I both love to cook and wanted a space where we could work together at the same time. The small bathroom needed to feel less cluttered and gain storage space. Our contractor provided decisive support, validated our suggestions, and helped to define the details before starting the work. We wanted to make this apartment our own, and he was happy to accommodate our choices, but he also made sure they were practical. As soon as we closed on the apartment, the team went in and started the demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before construction, we spent a lot of time pulling together the look and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view on the style we were trying to achieve. Our material choices included Carrara marble, cement and ceramic tile, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and black and white cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We opened up the kitchen entryway slightly to let additional light come through to the dining area. We opted for countertops on opposite sides to maximize prep space and to accommodate a full semi-professional espresso setup—Fabio is a coffee geek. Our Sweeten contractor helped us finalize our design with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spend a great deal of time in the kitchen and didn’t want strong colors we may grow tired of quickly, and settled on black cabinets with patterned ceramic floor tiles to add interest. While we tried to stay within our budget as much as possible, we splurged on professional heavy-duty appliances. We went with a modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased copper cabinet pulls online. The new kitchen is fantastic—the storage space feels especially luxurious compared to our previous kitchens.</p>

<p>We kept the bathroom’s tub and had it re-enameled but replaced the sink, cabinetry, hardware, and had the floor and walls retiled. We used a gold, black and white color theme that coordinated with the light fixtures and cement floor tiles. To create storage space, we built a new partially recessed medicine cabinet hidden behind the door. There was no heat in the bathroom, and with long New York winters in mind, we added a small towel heater.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The flooring throughout the apartment needed to be replaced, and our contractor took us to his supplier for a selection of inexpensive but great-looking wood flooring. We went with a light-colored wood with dark veins to generate an interesting contrast. The shelves in the rooms’ closets were falling apart. Initially, we planned on using IKEA shelving to replace them but because they weren’t standard size, we had them custom-designed by <a href="https://www.californiaclosets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Closets</a> to optimize our storage space.</p>

<p>Our son was born one month into the renovation, and we were able to trust our contractor and his colleagues to handle the work with limited supervision. As with most renovation projects, some of our plans fell through unexpectedly, but our contractor and his team made sure we stayed on track and resolved every issue quickly and efficiently. The renovation has been complete for almost a year, and we could not be happier with our new apartment. Thanks to our contractor and Sweeten, we got our dream home and moved in on schedule.</p>
<p>Thank you Melina and Fabio for sharing how a renovation can be completed with grace under time constraint. We hope you continue to enjoy your home!</p>
