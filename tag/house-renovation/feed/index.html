<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-43509 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> “After&#8221; photos by Michael Hnatov for Sweeten</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m shocked by how long it took us to renovate,” the owner of this Westchester, New York, home said. “You know what they say about having kids, though: <i>The days are long but the years are short</i>.”<i> </i>The house, at 5,500 square feet, was also large, and in great, if not quite stylish, condition. It felt livable, and that’s why these finance execs-cum-parents of now high-school-age daughters put the finishing touches on their renovation nearly a decade after buying it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They did it by listing the project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span></a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, combing through bids and hiring <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">this design-build firm</span></a>. The result: an eclectic redo that delivered this trad home straight into the 21st century.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single-family house, built in the early 1960s, is like many in this Westchester County suburb. Its layout featured a formal entry hall and a dedicated dining room, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a finished basement</a> that boosts the total square footage. When the family of four and their pets moved into the home, it had just received a round of pre-sale renovations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kids were in elementary school. “We always knew we’d update it and make it more our style at some point,” the owner said, “but we weren’t in a rush.” They’d lived happily in Manhattan for 15 years, and then in a rental in Scarsdale for three more before committing to the new home. “We wanted,” said the owner, “to live in our home long enough to find a clear vision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When the goal of the project crystallized, it was fairly simple: They wanted to preserve the home’s great bones and traditional features—including old hardwood floors, large windows with a diamond grill pattern, some stained-glass touches—and blend in a modern-classic feel. Some plans were solely functional. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The bathrooms, which had not been renovated since the home was built, were outdated and slated for a full redo. But the rest of the house would get a gentle, progressively modern update that would play off and enhance what was already there.  They decided to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/renovate-home-once-pieces-expert-192016677.html?guccounter=1">renovate their whole home at once</a>, instead of in pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43506 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg" alt="Foyer stairs" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-stairs-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">We now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We were excited about the job as a whole,” the owner said, but “relieved to know we could do a lot just by just adding a few touches.” In the end, they did a bit more than that. The home’s spacious foyer, already a stunner, got a dramatic makeover, featuring daring large-slab marble tile and a deco-style beaded chandelier. Those bathrooms got their gut-jobs, redone with glass-walled showers, gleaming fixtures, and statement lighting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mudroom received a sleek redesign, with functional storage, and whimsical bright-blue penny-round floor tile. And the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen received a playful update</a>, with a painted hardwood floor, a boldly mirrored backsplash, and a wraparound marble overlay on the existing peninsula providing a stylish second life for the high-end cabinetry that was already there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The process, the owner warned, was grueling at times, especially since the family of four lived in the house throughout. “We expected some inconvenience—especially since we have a dog and a cat—but it was a big challenge,” the owner said. “Towels and blankets under doors went a long way, but dust found its way around.”</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite inconveniences, the project also bore happy surprises, like the ugly, thin carpet in the office that lifted to reveal a beautiful parquet floor. The Sweeten contractor cleaned it up and stained it white, which markedly opened the space. “We now have three rooms with different patterns of wood floor,” the owner says. While to some this might sound like a nightmare scenario, these little-bit-of-everything-loving homeowners find the mixed-up style “very cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because one never knows when a gorgeous discovery will save the contractors a few days’ effort, this homeowner suggests taking time to map out the renovation process in detail, with contingencies. </span><span class="s1">And ask for the tough love you need to maintain your timeline: ordering deadlines for materials so you’ll have them before they’re needed; assignments for moving things around the house as work carries on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor,” the homeowner says, “was patient and thoughtful about what needed to be ordered. More important, he completed work on time, if not early. He was easy to work with, responsive and flexible. We also knew that, should that attitude change, Sweeten had our backs.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46407" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Opportunities for efficiency and satisfaction can be found by playing an active part in the project, the homeowner said. Living in the house throughout the process, he says, allowed the family to see it day-to-day. “My favorite part,” he said, “was watching the rooms finish one by one and seeing the larger picture slowly emerge.” </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, he said, the family stayed close to their budgeted figures and felt real satisfaction in the job’s completion. “It’s great to be done and the house finally feels like our home,” he said. “The vision we had came together, and now we can build on it with details like family photos and objects we love.”  </span></p>
