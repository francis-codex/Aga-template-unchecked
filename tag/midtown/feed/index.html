										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"> A new layout reveals a design that is just right</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ting and S. moved back to their New York co-op after four years of living abroad, Ting, an architect, had an opportunity to remodel the fixer-upper they had been renting out. They now had a 6-month-old, so not only did they need a second bedroom in their almost 1,000<span style="color: #000000;">-square-foot space</span>, but they also needed to make more efficient use of wide hallways and under-utilized closets. The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to bring in additional bids to a few other contractors they found through friends. At decision time, the duo chose to hire <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to begin building their new home. </i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an architect, renovating your own home is both a dream and a rite of passage. So when it came time to purchase our own apartment, I secretly hoped we’d find one with enough square footage but in desperate need of TLC.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided on Midtown Manhattan for the location, so we could both walk to work, and after months of searching, we found a large one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op, nearly a thousand square feet in a postwar building that fit the bill perfectly: it had a smart layout that featured a windowed dining alcove; three poorly-utilized but large closets; and extra wide hallway with doors that just gathered dust. The finishes showed significant wear and tear as well: the kitchen was so outdated it had metal cabinets, its linoleum floor tiles were crumbling under our feet, and the bathroom’s blue tiles were screaming for a change. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But thanks to the 80/20 carpeting co-op rule, the parquet flooring was in great shape! In short, the original owner had not done much in the half a century she&#8217;d spent in the apartment, and we were happy to take on the challenge and make it our own. </span><span class="s1">We’d decided to live in the apartment for a while before renovating it, but just a few months into our blissful home ownership, S. a journalist, was offered a job transfer to London. I hastily put away my plans, packed our bags, and moved across the pond.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast-forward four years and a tenant later, we came back to New York City with a 6-month-old in tow. We felt the urgency to renovate more than ever before. I knew I had my work cut out for me. I also had just started my own design practice to work from home—what better way to show my work than to live in my own design? </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">S. and I have similar tastes: we like clean lines, and simple, classic materials and color palettes. He has a penchant for mid-century and I have a soft spot for modern, but it was not difficult to marry the two. We chose a white base palette, accented with mix-and-matched metal hardware to create visual interest but not clutter. With the low ceilings in a postwar co-op, the color palette really helped to brighten the space. The real design challenge we faced was creating an additional bedroom and utilizing the storage spaces more efficiently.</span></p>

The result? A perfect two-bedroom home with a roomy open kitchen and living space for entertaining, a large bathroom to accommodate a growing family, a cozy baby nursery, and a king-sized master bedroom with a walk-in closet!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it came time to selecting a contractor to carry out our dream-home renovation, I first asked my friends in the field to recommend contractors they have worked with. In the meantime, while searching online I came across Sweeten’s website and immediately thought, &#8220;What a good idea!&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After reading testimonials, I decided to post our project on the site. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why not get a few more bids to compare!</a> Despite our relatively small scope (I only posted the kitchen and nursery as Phase One), we were matched with four contractors to start, and, after speaking with each one on the phone, I decided to interview two of them in person, along with a contractor recommended by a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When I first met our Sweeten general contractor, his calm demeanor and knowledgeable answers stood out among the rest. Matching these qualities was his higher bid. Sweeten helped us level the bids across the final two, vouched for his quality, and we are glad we picked him! He acted as a true partner during this entire renovation, worked with my design challenges enthusiastically, and delivered a home that we couldn’t be prouder to call our own.</span></p>

Our contractor was always able to find solutions to each problem. Luckily, the only major hiccup was having to upgrade the entire electrical system. At the end of the day, it took less construction time than it took to obtain permits and approvals; we were even pleasantly surprised to finish ahead of schedule! I think in Manhattan that is unheard of! With Sweeten&#8217;s help, an architect&#8217;s dream home came true, I can&#8217;t wait to work on my next Sweeten project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So many exciting developments have been bubbling up behind the scenes at theSweeten! Among them is a new photo series we’ve been working on with the help of our friend, photographer <a href="https://jeffreykilmer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Kilmer</a>. Rather than the usual &#8216;before &amp; after,&#8217; we’re taking our site visits up a notch, and including professional shots of the during stages as well. Soon, you&#8217;ll start to see the results of this new series of renovation photos: before, during &amp; after. Until then, here&#8217;s a preview of some of those beautiful, uncensored &#8216;durning&#8217; shots.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famurat Builders</a> was selected from the matches for this Fort Greene couple&#8217;s renovation. The project is due to wrap up shortly, and we can&#8217;t wait to see the space built out and refinished!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48061 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>This apartment combination in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen is a collaboration between two tS members &#8212; <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Mikhael Architect</a> is the project architect, and the team at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulson Management</a> is carrying out the construction. The project is scheduled to finish up later this summer.  We&#8217;ll be sharing more of the construction progress next month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48063 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NewPhotoProject-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>And since we don&#8217;t just do home renovations at theSweeten, here&#8217;s a look at a Midtown office remodel that was awarded to <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecostruct</a>. The before, during, &amp; after will be revealed soon!</p>

<p>Susan knew exactly what she wanted for this Midtown apartment. All she needed was the right person to make it happen &#8211;take a look below!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week at Forever Construction &amp; Design, Inc. They just wrapped up two projects, one, a studio renovation in Midtown and the other an office in Chelsea . We met with Harry Grahm owner of Forever Construction &amp; Design to get the scoop.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/New-office-Chelsea-New-York-NY-awarded-to-contractor/364#details"> first project </a>was one that Forever Construction &amp; Design was connected to via theSweeten. The company, <a href="https://www.fanbridge.com/">Fanbridge,</a> needed a very quick office renovation to minimize the interruption to their growing team. They needed to remove some walls and add glass inserts to others, change some of the lighting, refinish the floors and then a fresh coat of paint on everything.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_3007">

<dd><span class="img-label"> The newly refinished floor has that great old school industrial loft feel.</span></dd>

<dd><span class="img-label"> FanBridge was busy moving in when we were there. Harry&#8217;s work was done and they couldn&#8217;t have been happier.</span></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Noah Dinkin the Co-Founder of FanBridge said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Harry and his crew came through for us 100%.  Everything was handled not only professionally, but on time and in budget.  Since we&#8217;ve moved in, Harry has remained available for any small fixes we hadn&#8217;t anticipated.  All in all, both theSweeten and Forever Design were totally positive experiences and highly recommended.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Awesome Thanks Noah!</p>
<p>For the studio Harry &amp; his team worked closely with the clients&#8217; concerns and budget to give this studio apartment a thorough upgrade which included an all-new kitchen, bathroom updates, new storage solutions, lighting &amp; hardware, fresh paint &amp; refinished hardwoods. To keep within budget the homeowners went with a great alternative to skim coating and  pre-fab cabinetry rather than custom.</p>

He also expanded it, adding counter space, cabinets and a refrigerator where a closet used to be.</span> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign12.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2795 mb-10" title="foreverdesign12" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign12.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign12.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign12-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span class="img-label">  Harry had suggested subway tiles to keep within the strict budget, but says he got a phone call from this homeowner when they fell in love with this slightly pricier glass version!

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-2794 mb-0" title="foreverdesign11" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/foreverdesign11-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Harry let me in on a little industry secret:  rather than skim coating, the crew sanded down the studio walls to remove blemishes, then chose a paint in a matte finish which absorbs light to hide imperfections. The best part&#8211;this worthwhile alternative can be a serious money-saver!</p>
<p>Next week we&#8217;ll have the &#8216;after&#8217; photos for from this project. Also there is something wacky going on with our blog, we&#8217;ll have it fix asap.</p>
