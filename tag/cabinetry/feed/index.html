The key to owning and making the most of the space is a layout that maximizes efficiency, like a galley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By definition, a galley kitchen consists of two parallel sides with a narrow passage in between. </span><span class="s1">A galley kitchen layout works best for small kitchens—less than 90 square feet. Four to 6 feet between parallel sides maximize efficiency and workflow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> kitchens to see how this type of small-space layout can work for you.</span></p><h3>A breakthrough for a galley kitchen</h3><p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with stainless steel refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56034" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew and Germàn modernized their galley kitchen in their 1936 Med-Deco home. The room was closed off to the rest of the living spaces. The renovation plan was to keep the square footage the same so as to not disturb any architectural details with expansion. However, breaking through the wall for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-kitchen-pass-through-gets-social-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass-through breakfast bar</a> was the solution to open the space up to the living room. It was the right decision: it ended up becoming an eight-foot centerpiece in the home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><h3>Smart design expands this tiny galley kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-full" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>The six-foot-wide <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a> in Emily’s prewar apartment was originally an enclosed space. Several ideas helped it feel open and less closed in. <span class="s1">In place of upper cabinets, open shelving in marble and brass offered the airiness the small kitchen needed. </span><span class="s2">An undercounter refrigerator took up less space and was less visually intrusive.</span></p><p>To make the layout more ideal for entertaining, her Sweeten contractor created a pass-through window with an extended counter and two stools on the non-kitchen side. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post your project</a> on Sweeten. Discuss with your contractor if a pass-through window is possible in your kitchen.</p><h3>A pass-through window brightens up a dark kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-M-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40045 size-full" title="white-overhead-gray-under-counter-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-M-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="kitchen with white overhead cabinets and white countertop and farmhouse sink and gray under counter cabinets and dark tile flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-M-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-M-Kitchen02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Homeowner-M-Kitchen02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan didn’t want to change her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">galley kitchen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> floor plan or footprint</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> She just wanted to give the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/decisions-galley-kitchen-renovation-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark kitchen space</a> a facelift. All new fixtures contributed to the lighter look, as did the extension of a pass-through window into the main living space. Her contractor knocked down the bar to countertop height and enlarged the opening. Now, all the light from the neighboring room streams in.</span></p><h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A smart layout is key in a </span>galley kitchen</h3><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1.jpg" alt="black granite countertop in a white galley kitchen with white kitchen cabinets with handles and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50376" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-13-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Storage and a smart layout made all the difference for Monica’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/charm-queens-row-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodel</a>. For more convenient kitchen storage, a broom closet was transformed into a pull-out food pantry. The refrigerator sat outside of the row of board-and-batten-style cabinets keeping its height and size out of sight. Adding to the galley kitchen’s character was a cozy eat-in dining niche.</span></p><h3>A single wall of cabinets suits a narrow galley kitchen</h3><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20690 size-full" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jenna_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize Jenna’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/making-way-for-a-nursery-and-more-in-this-duplex-apartment-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrow galley kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a run of upper and base cabinets sit along one wall, and face a flush refrigerator and uncluttered wall. Although she admits, “I’m in the process of creating a “bucket list” installation for the remaining wall, though I’m enjoying the space the empty wall creates.” With only the width of a range to work in, this layout presents an efficient way to navigate this space.</span></p><h3>Open shelves in a galley kitchen look stylishly neat</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21171 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Daniel_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daniel, a food writer and former chef, installed <span class="s2">open shelving</span></span><span class="s3"> instead of upper cabinets along half of the wall in the kitchen. This eliminated the feeling of claustrophobia that plagued the old kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Sweeten contractor moved the fridge away from the entryway, where it had made entering the kitchen difficult. It was relocated to the opposite end creating symmetry and making it easier to move through the space. See how <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten vets general contractors</a> so homeowners don&#8217;t have to.</span></p><h3>Rearranging the dining area allows for added storage</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38056 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, kitchen, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheilaja and Sergio’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long galley kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had a dining space at the end that they no longer needed (thanks to moving it in the living and entryway area). They instead used that extra space to take advantage of the room’s length and install lower cabinets all the way to the window wall. To make it feel even bigger, they opted for one long wood shelf opposite the wall of upper cabinets.</span></p><h3>Clever idea: shallow cabinets save space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37242 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Inwood kitchen renovation, remodel, after, design, construction" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Sandra-Goldmark-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra and Michael overhauled their </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/sustainable-remodel-inwood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing galley kitchen layout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add more cabinet and counter space. They chose narrow base cabinets (basically wall cabinets) to save the square footage without making it feel more cramped.</span></p><h3>Relocating a bulky fridge frees up valuable space</h3><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23887 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />In Hari and Kaity’s galley kitchen the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/hari-kaitys-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refrigerator placement</a> minimized counter space and the surrounding walls made the whole space tight. They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space. Pro tip: if you’re unsure about taking down walls, moving your refrigerator can be an alternative to free up space while preserving the existing layout.</p><h3>A galley kitchen puts dead space to use</h3><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="galley kitchen with blue walls and granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten homeowner Rashmi had no interest in an open kitchen when it was time to renovate. She lived with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/manhattan-kitchen-remodel-turns-true-blue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> for four years to understand what she needed from the room. To save space, shallower 18” kitchen cabinets were installed on one side. Closer to the entry, a narrow eat-in bar that was an extension from the countertop in the kitchen fit two stools. Opposite the bar, Rashmi installed built-in cabinets for storage and a washer and dryer. It had once been dead space.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your kitchen or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p><p><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-2641" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-2641"><p class="p1">A galley kitchen consists of two parallel sides with a narrow, hallway-like passage in between. The ideal distance between the two walls is four to six feet, which helps to maximize efficiency and workflow. Homeowners with smaller kitchens–meaning less than 90 square feet–would benefit from a galley kitchen layout.</p></div>

					</div>

					<div id="elementor-tab-content-2642" class="elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix" data-tab="2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="elementor-tab-title-2642"><p class="p1">There are several ways to make a galley kitchen’s hallway-like appearance look bigger. First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

Alternatively, it can be installed overhead elsewhere in the kitchen. Separating the appliances help with flow and movement if more than one cook is working in the space. Drawer-style microwaves can also be placed in lower cabinets and functions as a pull-out.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pre-fab cabinetry—like a pantry cabinet from IKEA—can be a simple way to fulfill the kitchen renovation ideas you’ve been dreaming about</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning your new kitchen design is an exciting time. It’s fun to walk through a big-box store like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, or <a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and start brainstorming the look and feel of your space. These types of stores offer pretty much everything you need to build your kitchen, from cabinets and countertops to appliances, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucets</a>, sinks, and more. Even if you’re choosing to design and sketch out your own kitchen renovation ideas from scratch, it’s good to know what’s out there. Below are five examples of Sweeten kitchens that feature IKEA products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25466 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, pantry cabinet, countertop, sink, and oven range</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a contemporary design that would mesh well with the original molding and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in their new home, Jerry and Janet chose <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base cabinetry</a>—and a tall pantry cabinet—with molding from IKEA. To give them a modern edge, they had them painted in Balboa Mist and Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore. The gray tones were then incorporated into the design of their geometric backsplash tile and contrasted by a white countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25467 size-chrono" title="range, hood, cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25468 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Ursula</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, island, and hood</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ursula transformed a dark kitchen that lacked windows into a lighter and brighter space by incorporating white cabinets with a high-gloss finish. Since the kitchen didn’t offer much in the way of prep space, she implemented a few clever kitchen renovation ideas with an island from IKEA that resembles a dresser and went for a dusky shade of gray to add some contrast. Stainless steel appliances completed the look, including a super sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> that reflects the light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25469 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Fabio and Melina</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a narrow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> that hadn’t been touched in 40 years, Fabio and Melina set out to design a whole new space that matched their personal tastes. They chose black cabinets to cement their strong point of view and included a few glass-fronted doors. A white countertop adds the perfect amount of contrast while a patterned floor tile helps tie the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25470 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Laura and Matthew</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet, and microwave</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Matthew realized that the original cabinets in their new home had been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted</a> several times over and couldn’t be salvaged, so they purchased all new cabinets in a soft shade of gray. They also found a stainless steel microwave at IKEA that matched the look of their new range for a crisp, uniform appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25471 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregg and Kelly</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With two windows nestled in shadowy nooks and dark cabinets in the existing kitchen, Gregg and Kelly knew that they wanted it to feel as light and airy as possible. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knocking down walls</a> filled the space with natural light, and white, high-gloss cabinets with flat front doors brightened up the kitchen even more. Honed black granite countertops provide a pop of contrast against the white backdrop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Map out your bathroom storage strategy, using a vanity, shelves, custom built-ins and secret niches</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>

</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Match an entire apartment to a previous renovation and build dream shoe storage in Hell’s Kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Matthew, the managing director of a fashion advertising agency, bought his apartment in 2012, only half of it had gone through a renovation. A few elements, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and floors, were in the present. Everything else stood sadly in the past. The old radiators stuck out like sore thumbs. So did the sliding doors of the storage closets. Then Matthew had the sartorial problem of 87 pairs of shoes stacked up against a wall in the one-bedroom co-op.  “I really wanted to bring the entire apartment up to a modern, minimalist, clutter-free design,” said Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Much of the design was done from scratch, so Matthew <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4676#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and worked with his design/build <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. “We literally went through twenty design options for the shoe closet alone,” Matthew said. But the outcome was worth it. The shoe storage is designed to Matthew’s shoe size, which is a nine. There is room for 90 pairs, including his favorites, Common Projects Blush sneakers and black Gucci loafers. The radiator in the living space is hidden under a desk where Matthew can sit for breakfast by the window. In the bedroom, a dressing bench, flanked by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>, covers up the other radiator. The remaining closet doors were replaced to match the wood veneer of the shoe storage. Each door has hidden hardware and pops open when it is pushed, eliminating the need for handles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the renovation evolved, the Sweeten contractor also installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden storage unit</a> next to the laundry to utilize every inch of space in the 790-square-foot apartment. They also encouraged Matthew to replace the window trimmings to match the custom carpentry. “We did one window first and I loved it, so we just did every window,” Matthew said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matthew has a strong affection for the color orange. Its presence in his renovation was a must. “I wanted it in there but didn’t want it to be obnoxious,” he said. After bouncing around various options of visibility, Matthew settled on adding it to the inside of his shoe closet. “You have to open the closet and pull out a drawer, but I see it every day,” he said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Custom desk (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/office/desks/parsons-desks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a>. White desk chair (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.dwr.com/kitchen-dining-chairs-benches/111-navy-chair/3773.html?lang=en_US#q=navy%2Bchair&amp;lang=en_US&amp;start=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Within Reach</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 7 small apartment ideas are ideal inspiration for stylish storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living in a city where space is limited can mean giving up square footage in favor of location. Small apartments can feel restrictive; there&#8217;s less room for stuff and fewer zones that can be dedicated to specific functions. When your square footage doesn’t allow for an office, dining room, or storage closet, it’s time to think outside the box. These clever small apartment ideas, brought to life from Sweeten renovations, prove that you can personalize your space to meet your needs in <em>any</em> size apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22053 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white and black galley kitchen with yellow stools" width="1600" height="2401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>This small kitchen loses a radiator and gets a window seat (plus storage!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/evelyns-sweetened-manhattan-co-op-homeowner-guest-post/">Evelyn’s</a> galley kitchen suffered from wasted space; there was a radiator beneath the window that was never used. She had it removed and replaced with a window seat with storage underneath, a suggestion given to her by her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Now serving two purposes, the space provides additional storage and a dining nook that seats up to four.</p>

<h3>A mini kitchen peninsula offers space for work and play</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/">Frans and Dalal’s</a> studio apartment, the kitchen offered very little workspace and barely any room for a table and chairs. By incorporating a mini peninsula into the new kitchen design, the couple was able to add extra prep space and a dining perch that’s perfect for the two of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22055 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg" alt="Prewar galley kitchen with counter and bar seating in living room" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen pass-through creates much-needed counter space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow galley kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily&#8217;s</a> studio apartment had virtually no counter space and nowhere to sit down for a meal. By extending the countertop through a newly created pass-through in the wall, Emily was able to define a spot for dining and enhance the social aspect of the kitchen by opening it up to the main living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22057 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A coziest office nook makes its entrance in a small entryway</strong></h3>
<p>Having put a new plan in motion for her kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily</a> set her sights on a pair of shallow closets that took up valuable floor space in the entryway to her apartment. She combined the closets and carved out an office nook complete with a desk, chair, and open shelving for books and office supplies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22058 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Existing closet space in a studio swaps to become an office niche</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous owner of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio apartment had knocked out a large closet to create a workspace, replacing it with a tiny closet in the bedroom area. Lauren chose to swap the spaces during her renovation: the home office reverted back to clothing storage while the small closet—which turned out to be the ideal size for a workspace—became an office niche.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22060 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Bed loft platform in studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A lofted bed platform adds clothing storage behind rich wooden tones</strong></h3>
<p>After successfully swapping the small closet for a larger one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren</a> worked with her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315">Sweeten general contractor</a> to think of other ways to add storage and reduce clutter throughout her apartment. In need of a place to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for guests, her contractor rebuilt the existing bed loft platform, adding three bays of storage that were made easily accessible from the foot of the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22059 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg" alt="Storage nook above closet in master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Make every inch count—especially if you have tall ceilings!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s no more room on the floor, the only way to go is up. To make the most of the 11-foot ceilings in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/west-village-co-op-renovation/">Elizabeth’s</a> apartment, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818">Sweeten general contractor</a> suggested using the space to create more storage—an idea she couldn’t say no to. Rather than shoving things under the bed, this alcove is the perfect solution for tucking things out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amber and Chris made their space work for them by transforming their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dining nook into a kid&#8217;s bedroom</a> complete with a transom window to allow ample sunlight to pass through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The last six months have brought big-time changes for Blaise, Kristin, and their family of five. After welcoming their third child and moving from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Blaise and Kristin were ready to prep their new home in Prospect Lefferts Gardens for the long run. First up: a kitchen and laundry room update. We stopped in to take some photos along the way, but the rest of this story is told by Blaise, himself.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brooklyn-kitchen-and-laundry-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11124 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN_BlaiseKitchen-cover-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>&#8220;Sweeten made it easy to communicate our vision to contractors before they even set foot in our home.&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Blaise C., Prospect Lefferts Gardens homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we moved into our new home six months ago, we almost didn&#8217;t notice how limited the kitchen was. Living out of boxes and welcoming a newborn, it took us a few weeks to realize that we were having trouble finding space for groceries and that we had accidentally made a habit of storing kitchen basics in the basement. The move just about doubled the total space of our home, and yet we were struggling to find a place for everyday kitchen stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our punch list was pretty classic: kitchen storage was sorely lacking and countertop space was a joke. We are working parents who don&#8217;t cook that often, but we were ready to move our pots and pans out of the oven. We also realized that the bar-height counter was inaccessible for our kids and wanted to create a central gathering spot with a more standard counter height.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11126 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-01-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11127 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-03-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen had been recently renovated and we liked the look, so we initially entertained the possibility of a quick fix like purchasing a kitchen island, but ended up deciding to use what we had and expand on it. At first, I tried to juggle contractor bids on my own, but with kids and jobs, that turned out to be decidedly easier said than done. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1197" target="_blank">posted the project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank">Sweeten</a> and added to the plans to create a laundry room in the basement by enclosing our washer/dryer with built-out walls and solid doors.<span id="more-11119"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11128 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Before-02-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2536" target="_blank">this Sweeten contractor</a> (of recent <a href="https://sweeten.com/team/apartment-renovation-east-village/" target="_blank">Sweeten blog fame!</a>) and we awarded our project to him after seeing his straightforward and realistic style. My biggest fear was that a contractor would say yes to anything to seal the deal, but he gave us a realistic completion date and it was nice to know from the start that his team had already been screened by Sweeten.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11129 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-01-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11130 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02.png" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/during-02-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor guided the work through multiple stages and helped us seamlessly extend our existing kitchen cabinetry with custom drawers, stained and finished to match the look we already had. When we had trouble coming up with matching backsplash tile, he managed to track it down with a local builder. We were also grateful for his willingness to work around our family&#8217;s schedule &#8211; naturally, we picked New York&#8217;s most brutal winter to live through a kitchen renovation and relied on Paul to gracefully adjust on snow days when the kids were home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After watching our contractor put the new cabinetry pieces in place and create a dedicated laundry room, we found a few other spots for his team to add finishing touches and details including cosmetic wall patching and custom doors to replace a tired set that concealed the fuse boxes for the property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11134 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_06-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11135 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_07-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are thrilled with the results and psyched that we were able to work with so much of what we already had. Instead of cutting into our living space, the new drawers and extended counters have preserved our open kitchen and put everything within reach. The new laundry room helps us stay organized and minimizes the sound of the machines so that we can enjoy the play space with our kids. Even my mother-in-law was impressed, an unforeseen but welcome benefit of the hard work!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11131 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_02-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11133 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen and laundry renovation" width="600" height="906" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWEETEN-BlaiseKitchen_01-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bravo to Blaise and his gang for a great team effort! A smart kitchen extension and a real laundry room are a huge win for any NYC family. We&#8217;re always glad when we can impress extended family members; we just hope the pans and the oven are adjusting to their newly-longer-distance relationship!</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>We know first-hand how daunting it can be to envision renovation options as you&#8217;re standing in a crowded open house. This week, we are beyond psyched to share a first look at our new partnership with Corcoran, New York&#8217;s preeminent real estate group. We&#8217;ll be partnering with Corcoran to help buyers and sellers demystify the renovation process, [&#8230;]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We know first-hand how daunting it can be to envision renovation options as you&#8217;re standing in a crowded open house. This week, we are beyond psyched to share a first look at our new partnership with <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corcoran</a>, New York&#8217;s preeminent real estate group. We&#8217;ll be partnering with Corcoran to help buyers and sellers demystify the renovation process, understand design options for particular properties, and break down potential upgrades at various price points. Over the next few months, you&#8217;ll see more information for first-time buyers about how to value renovations for properties on the market, ideas for new homeowners looking to undo the renovation decisions of prior owners, and guidance for sellers looking to maximize their re-sale value or refresh a property before it gets listed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our first video take, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill Lauer, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kent</a> run us through kitchen renovation options, in under a minute, for a <a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/2840734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom apartment</a> on the market for $525,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.corcoran.com/nyc/listings/display/2840734"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10990" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png" alt="SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02" width="600" height="200" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02.png 659w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-300x100.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SWEETEN_corcoran-59madison-01-02-600x200.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the budget in the $10k &#8211; $30k range, Jean focuses in on the most immediately visible elements of the kitchen: new tile and backsplash, under-cabinet lighting, painting cupboards, and a possible high-impact splurge on new countertops. With a $30k &#8211; $60k budget, Jean and Kent help us picture a more transformative project: opening the kitchen up to the living room, creating a custom prep and dining island, bringing millwork finishes from the living room to new kitchen cabinetry, and re-doing the kitchen floor. Now press play!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re just getting started with this new Corcoran collaboration and can&#8217;t wait to share more with you as the spring real estate market warms up. Stay tuned for more in the works from Jean and Team Sweeten.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Sweeten connected me with an awesome, smart, and honest contractor, which is all you need to make it happen.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Sanaya K., Clinton Hill homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a number of her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/3-kitchen-renovations-in-brooklyn/">Clinton Hill Co-op neighbors</a>, homeowner Sanaya spent years living with decades-old cabinetry, outdated appliances, and unnecessarily cramped spaces before taking the plunge with a complete <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> renovation of her kitchen. &#8220;The kitchen was incredibly outdated,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The cabinets were falling apart and I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that there were cans of food holding up the shelves in one spot!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and her husband, Chris, had to contend with missing shelves and work around what looked like water damage from a prior leak. In addition, the original layout included a wall between the kitchen and pantry, which closed off both spaces and served no functional purpose. &#8220;It was tight,&#8221; Sanaya recalled. &#8220;Totally unnecessary, and made the space feel like a maze of walls.&#8221; Because of the placement of this dividing wall and the location of the refrigerator, counter space was seriously lacking. In her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/736">project post on Sweeten</a>, Sanaya did not mince words: &#8220;…everything must go.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with her Sweeten matches, Sanaya chose to work with Sweeten Expert, Alan, who helped bring together the homeowner’s renovation game plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10914 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10934 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya took on three unconventional design choices to replace existing finishes: counter tops, the backsplash, and flooring. <span id="more-10886"></span>After plenty of online research, she was originally inspired by wood counters, &#8220;I love wood counters!&#8221;, she explained. &#8220;Alan was very helpful with pros and cons. I swooned over that idea but ultimately decided against them &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to worry about the durability of the counters, near the stove and sink in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan helped to connect Sanaya with other homeowners who had considered similar choices and with an expert at Lowe&#8217;s in Red Hook who helped her determine the new kitchen layout. She ended up going with gray Caesarstone counters that beautifully offset the new, white shaker-style cabinets. For the backsplash, Sanaya chose a luminous blue-gray penny tile. Though they are more often used in bathrooms, here, the penny tile adds visual detail and pattern to the clean lines of the cabinets. Keeping with her goal of transforming and maximizing every last inch, Sanaya selected cork flooring, made in long planks, instead of the more typical square pieces. The natural accent brings warmth to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10917 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10935 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and Chris (who, while renovating the kitchen, was simultaneously in the process of opening his second restaurant, <a href="https://www.centannibrooklyn.com/">Cent&#8217;Anni</a> in Crown Heights) were equal parts overwhelmed and happily immersed in the selection of these materials, and in the end, both are thrilled with the results. The new floor-to-ceiling cabinetry has dramatically increased the functional space of the kitchen. With the wall between the kitchen and pantry gone, Sanaya can easily access the additional storage and benefits every day from the counter space that was gained in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10920 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There are whole shelves that I haven’t even moved into yet! I feel like I can breathe and cook freely without chopping vegetables on top of my cookbook. I am obsessed with how awesome the deep and long drawers are for pots and pans – it makes accessing them so much easier.&#8221; The project&#8217;s obvious functional benefits also brought along welcome aesthetic benefits, as Sanaya noted, &#8220;I’m so glad that some of the cabinets are glass – we get to look at some of our beautiful things that don’t get used daily, but they’re not in the way. And I am equally glad that most doors are wood – I don’t want to look at my pantry and no one else does either.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10937 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Sanaya and her husband are still playing with their new storage solutions and reveling in the new space, the completed renovation has left a hankering for more. &#8220;Now, I want to do so much more,&#8221; Sanaya says, laughing. &#8220;I want to rethink our living/dining room and perhaps install built-in shelves there and in the main hallway. And maybe it’s time to repaint our bedroom…the endless project!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1306/4609972374_d29e761b2b.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/4609972550_fcf110dd4a.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/4609973164_ba67d01791.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART" /></p>
<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/4609972720_04fb2bdf7e.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 01" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
