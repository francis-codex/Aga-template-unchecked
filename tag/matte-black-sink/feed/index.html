			<h2>Want to cut down on prep steps? Need more space for guests? These Thanksgiving-ready kitchens by Sweeten do it all.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49065 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Thanksgiving is a time people look forward to seeing friends and family and being thankful. But those things aside, big gatherings can be stressful on homeowners. The biggest challenge is kitchen organization; cooking and prepping food, along with needing space to serve. The right kitchen features can help ease the frustrations caused by clutter. Sweeten has helped homeowners design Thanksgiving-ready kitchens to ease the holiday strain. We selected these specific kitchens for their unique characteristics that will make any get-together easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sweeten</span></a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Roomy kitchen countertops produce Thanksgiving meals with ease</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg" alt="chef in his kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-42806 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">With friends and family gathering, Thanksgiving calls for generous kitchen counters. Yet, many kitchens lack the counter space it takes to host. Adding more work surface area creates more room and less clutter. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">As a chef, </a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">Arnish</a> </span>decided that a huge kitchen peninsula would solve many of his troubles. “Sometimes we have up to 80 people in the space.” Their renovation also included a wine fridge, which makes for less traffic in the kitchen when cooking and preparing.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>With large food prep, cooking, or spreading out platters, a considerable surface space is a must.</p>
<h3><strong>A small kitchen island comes with big advantages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" class="alignnone wp-image-24678 size-full" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Small spaces can hold untapped potential. When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula remodeled her kitchen with Sweeten</a>, she added a small kitchen island. The &#8220;dresser-style&#8221; island is a storage workhorse, providing three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and pots and pans. It&#8217;s ideal for food-forward holidays and dinner parties since it doubles as a serving station.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><strong>A deep and wide sink helps with dreaded dinner cleanup</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" title="white-countertop-with-farmhouse-sink"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen with white overhead cabinets and white countertop with farmhouse sink and backsplash with white subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-39860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">For dishes that can’t fit in the dishwasher and squeeze into a regular basin, deep and wide sinks don’t disappoint. Brooklyn brownstone owners <span>Christina and </span>Aaron, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/brownstone-kitchen-renovation-prospect-lefferts-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who renovated their kitchen with Sweeten</a>, chose a large volume farmhouse sink. The uniquely deep design is great for soaking extra-sticky dishes and accommodating baking trays or sauté pans.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Pass-throughs become conversation stations</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="all-white-kitchen-pass-through-window"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with stainless steel appliances and flush mounted ceiling light and pass through window bar with white countertop and white walls after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone wp-image-50990 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Adding barstools to the kitchen island makes conversation during Thanksgiving more enjoyable. Guests eager to lend a helping hand can prepare food and chat with the host without being in the way. In this Sweeten kitchen renovation, homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-living-room-renovation-puts-a-pool-table-in-the-spotlight/">Dan found having barstools</a> at the pass-through offered seating and a more open feel to the space.</p>
<h3><strong>Built-in pot fillers let you work smarter, not harder during Thanksgiving</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" style="color: #333333;" /></span></a>Installing a pot-filler above the stove eliminates a step from cooking. Romauld, an avid cook, included one in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/">his Elmhurst, Queens kitchen renovation.</a> No longer carrying a heavy pot from the sink to the stove allows him to save time and steps. This handy feature will make mashed potato duty at Thanksgiving (or corn on the cob, or pasta-making) much simpler.</p>
<h3><strong>The right kitchen appliances are a must for any Thanksgiving feast</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49067 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /> </span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">When planning a kitchen remodel, updating old appliances bring energy efficiency, increase functionalities, and a modern clean look. Homeowner Katy, who renovated her Hamptons kitchen with Sweeten, called in help to pick new appliances. &#8220;<span>I let my mother-in-law—a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/">holiday-entertaining superwoman choose</a>.&#8221; Among her selections was a single oven &#8220;with the largest cubic heating space she could find.&#8221; </span></p>
<h3><strong>A walk-in pantry makes storage more accessible</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-25562 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Walk-in pantries keep the main kitchen area uncluttered (a difficult task during the holidays!) The extra storage allows food staples, beverages, and canned goods to stay organized. Whether the pantry has a door or an open entry, it adds to the character of the kitchen. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/">Nazli painted her new kitchen pantry</a> a darker shade than the kitchen so the contents blended into the surrounding, seeming to disappear. If you&#8217;re an amateur home chef, consider adding a walk-in pantry for your larger kitchen appliances, pans, and bulk ingredients or spices.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Multifaceted kitchen island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="yellow kitchen tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-33846 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span>Sweeten homeowners Dawn and David added a huge island kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Park Slope kitchen renovation with Sweeten</a>. “People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner.”</span><span>  There is room to prepare food <em>and</em> lay it out beautifully at the same time. (We&#8217;re also huge fans of the yellow Moroccan tile, sure to be a conversation piece with dinner guests!)</span></p>
