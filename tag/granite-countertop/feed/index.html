			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Gina, a product director, and Dan, who works in account and finance, moved into his childhood home in Media, Pennsylvania, after relocating for a new job and learning they were going to start a family (their son Jack is now 2 years old). Dan’s parents were planning to retire and head south, so the couple rented their 1950s traditional brick, split-level home for a few years. It gave them time to think about the work they’d complete if they decided to make it their own. When they did buy it, the first-time homeowners had a renovation vision underway for the old-fashioned kitchen. The layout wasn’t ideal for entertaining or cooking, and they wanted to increase the square footage, too. “We wanted a bright, open kitchen that was traditional but with clean, modern touches,” Gina shared. The duo <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their Media kitchen renovation project</a> to Sweeten and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

Instead of having a traditional table and chairs, we wanted to have stools all around the table where people could casually gather,” Gina said. Plus, they still have a separate dining area on the lower level of the home in what was once a living room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of their much larger kitchen, the renovators decided against installing upper cabinetry. Ceiling-height cabinets surrounding the two-door refrigerator and island drawers offer more than enough storage.</span></p>

Sweeten matched Gina and Dan with a general contractor they felt comfortable with and worked hand-in-hand with them to first come up with a plan and then execute it. As a former project manager, Gina especially appreciated the contractor’s detailed timelines that laid out when each renovation step would occur. “They set up times for each task and ended up wrapping things up earlier than expected. They took whatever extra time they had and tried to get other things done based on the project, which really helped keep everything on track,” she shared.</span></p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41080 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Daniel-Hawkings-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span id="m_1960406457062611370gmail-docs-internal-guid-75986107-7fff-bac8-4cdc-7bc165881db5">Renovating the kitchen with a one-year-old in tow also meant the family needed plenty of notice about noisier or more disruptive work, which their project manager always delivered. “Having a dedicated project manager who was as skilled as he was, made us a bit sad when the project was over and we knew we wouldn’t see him anymore—I actually cried and hugged him our last day. I think it’s very rare anyone ever has that reaction to a kitchen renovation,” Gina said.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Their contractor also replaced a window over the kitchen sink to match the other white framed ones.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With a lot of wasted space, Rashmi knew a more efficient floor plan was in order</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28399 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Rashmi" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Intelligent use of space in a Manhattan kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Rashmi purchased a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side, she wanted to renovate the kitchen immediately. It was clearly run down, as the original kitchen in a prewar building, but had plenty of unused space and potential. “Once I moved in, I realized I needed to live with the space to understand what I really wanted,” said Rashmi. She gave herself six months—it took four years. At one stage, she even stored her bike in some dead space next to the fridge. She didn’t like the idea of an open kitchen, so knocking down a wall wasn’t an option. The main goal was to simply use the space effectively while flipping a hodgepodge of different whites into something bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Rashmi had owned a home before, but buying into a co-op was a new experience. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> and found a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors. She was having problems getting her package submitted to her co-op board for approval until she found her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;My contractor was an invaluable partner, especially during the planning and approval phase with my co-op and the building engineers,” she said. Once work got underway, Rashmi decided to give the kitchen a roomier feel by opting for 18-inch cabinets on one side rather than the standard 24 inch. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a> was also “life-changing.” A layout geared toward casual entertaining was also important, so she <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended the counter</a> right along the wall to include an eat-in perch and two chairs. Rather than go with backsplash tiles, Rashmi chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-gloss paint</a> for ease of cleaning. She picked a bright yet deep blue for the walls that contrasted with gold-toned cabinet hardware.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Rashmi worked from home, so her Sweeten contractor and his team were conscious that they were sharing the same workspace. “They worked clean and were as quiet as possible,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldn’t focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Gregg’s take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17774" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg" alt="gregg-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zero’d in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say “we can’t believe this is actually our apartment”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Prepping to pick kitchen countertop materials? Let these 9 Sweeten-remodeled kitchens inspire you</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just because kitchen counters get a lot of use in the home doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also look beautiful! But where should you start when picking kitchen countertop materials? Well, there are a few things you should know about each type of countertop material before making your final selection. Here&#8217;s a rundown of our favorite kitchen countertops from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> renovation projects: gorgeous photos <em>and </em>material descriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27214 size-chrono" title="countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg" alt="countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Corey_Kitchen-Countertop.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quartz Countertops</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quartz is a type of engineered stone, made from a combination of minerals, pigment, and resin. It is available in a wide range of colors and texture complexity. Quartz has become the most popular kitchen countertop material in <a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten kitchen renovations</a> probably because it is slightly less expensive, per square foot, than some of its other natural stone cousins, and because it is prized for extreme durability, resistance to stains and scratches, and its non-porous surface, which helps retain polish without sealants or waxes.</p>

<p><em><strong>“I love having guests over and can invite them to sit at the counter while I’m prepping snacks or a meal.” </strong></em><em><strong>– Heather, Sweeten homeowner </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Heather’s Sweetened Upper West Side Kitchen Renovation – Homeowner Guest Post" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather</a> went with <a href="https://www.lgviaterausa.com/productOverviews/33/by-product-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s Viatera</a> quartz countertop in Cirrus for her Upper West Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Granite Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granite is a natural stone with wide variation in color and detail. Its resistance to heat and scratches makes it a classic in the kitchen. Granite is known for its durability, but can require periodic re-sealing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Before &amp; After: Robyn and Alejandro’s Columbia Waterfront Industrial Kitchen — Sweetened!" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-robyn-and-alejandros-columbia-waterfront-industrial-kitchen-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robyn and Alejandro</a> in Brooklyn’s Columbia Waterfront District chose a granite countertop with gray undertones and luminous purple specks.</p>
<h3><strong>Marble Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marble has become an increasingly popular choice in luxury kitchens. More porous and softer than granite and engineered stone, (marble counters need to be sealed and are more susceptible to stains and etching), design-focused renovators seem to be willing to put up with marble&#8217;s drawbacks for its uncontested good looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Five Design Tricks Transform an Uptown Kitchen" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/five-design-tricks-transform-uptown-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12607 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_UES-04" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SWEETEN_UES-04-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Experts Lauren and Adam</a> included a Calacatta Caldia marble countertop with faint traces of green, gray, and yellow veining from <a href="https://www.abcworldwidestone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Stone</a> in an Upper East Side kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>Soapstone Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highly heat-, stain-, and bacteria-resistant, soapstone is a non-porous natural stone that is available in a range of light to dark gray matte tones, all with subtle veining. Unlike granite and marble materials that require sealing, soapstone needs regular polishing with mineral oil to help conceal surface scratches and add patina.</p>

<h3><strong>Dekton Countertops</strong></h3>
<p>A tougher and more durable alternative to concrete countertops, Dekton is an ultra-compacted hybrid of raw materials common to quartz, porcelain, and glass. The result is a virtually impenetrable surface with a grittier, industrial feel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12659" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<h3><strong>Butcher block countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ideal for adding warmth and charm, butcher block wood countertops provide a hardworking surface for food preparation. A number of Sweetened kitchens have mixed wood countertop sections with other materials like natural or engineered stone. This mix provides different options for food prep and serving. While butcher block is naturally heat-resistant and affordable, it can stain and age, wear in high-use areas and requires regular sanding and oiling to protect the wood.</p>
