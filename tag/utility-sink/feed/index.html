<h3>A fashionable—but not functional—period kitchen</h3>
<p>The kitchen was original from the 1930s and very Hollywood Art Deco. It was just one aspect we loved when we purchased our 1,400-square-foot co-op, located in a 1932 Spanish Revival building in Historic Filipinotown, a neighborhood near Los Angeles’ Echo Park.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" title="country-cottage-kitchen-butcher-block-countertop" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white country cottage kitchen with patterened floor tiles and butcher block countertop and golden oak cabinets after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51355 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-01-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Matt and I previously lived in a 600-square-foot apartment and never spent days hanging at home—it just didn’t have enough light and space. Looking for our next place, we realized that everything in our price range needed a large overhaul, or had been cheaply flipped and had an ugly poorly-designed kitchen.</p>
<h3>Seeking a fixer-upper kitchen</h3>
<p>I love to cook, and during our search, we’d decided that the sweet spot would be a place that was in good shape and had character but <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needed a new kitchen</a>.</p>
<p>As first-time renovators, we figured the hardest parts would be finding a contractor, negotiating bids, and avoiding surprise hidden costs. When we found <em>the one</em> on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, it turned out our biggest challenge was actually <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not hiring an architect or designer</a> as well. I sketched the kitchen out on my word processor!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="golden-oak-cabinets-farmhouse-sink" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="golden oak kitchen cabinets with butcher block countertop and undermount farmhouse sink and white backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="750" class="alignnone wp-image-51359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-05-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="undermount-farmhouse-sink-white-backsplash" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen windows over undermount farmhouse sink with black faucets and wooden countertop and white backsplash tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-51366 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/46582-Chrissy-Kitchen-12-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Thinking we would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-do the kitchen</a> right away, we purchased an induction hotplate and set it on the beautiful black-and-teal tile countertop. We found a basic fridge on Craigslist. We would also need to upgrade the unit’s electrical panel; we didn’t have the amps to run the hotplate and toaster simultaneously. When we first moved in, a kitchen wall had to be ripped out due to a leaky roof. It stayed that way until the renovation; it was rough in there!</p>
<h3>Flooring material for wet spaces</h3>
<p>We thought about trying to save the Art Deco details, especially the original tile countertops and the matching backsplash. But preserving the original aesthetic wasn’t an option. The counters weren’t the modern standard depth, so new appliances would not fit. We struggled with whether to go with deco tiles and white cabinets or scrap all that and let it be something modern. We went with the latter.</p>
<p>Going from the ground up, we discussed adding hardwood or cork flooring for a soft surface underfoot but decided against it. We wanted to make the kitchen contiguous with the laundry room, and we chose cement tile flooring to avoid worries about moisture. Another draw had to do with dirt. In our old apartment, we’d had terracotta tiled floors, which we loved, but the wide grout collected grime. The cement tile required narrower grout and seemed practical. It also brought a bold texture to our floors.</p>

<h3>Plywood cabinets and cement floor tile ground the kitchen</h3>
<p>Having ruled out natural wood for the floors, we were excited to use it for the cabinets. We feel intuitively drawn to wood and have chosen it for surfaces throughout our home, so we let that lead us. We went with plywood kitchen cabinets—it&#8217;s a cost-effective material, and we liked its functional aesthetic. Designing the layout for the custom base plywood cabinets was gratifying. Since we could dictate all dimensions, we spent time going over all of our kitchen wares and deciding how we wanted to store things. We’d measured the height of the coffee grinder and Chemex pitcher and knew which drawer they would live in long before the kitchen was built.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We thought a lot about the upper cabinetry, too. We initially felt nervous about open shelving, thinking everything would get dusty. But in the end, we did it, mainly to save money, and it turned out to be a great choice to keep the visuals simple and open. It makes putting away dishes a breeze!</p>
<h3>Personalized features make it home</h3>
<p>The backsplash was also cost-contingent. We kept saying we’d do subway tile to save money—but decided on handmade, natural clay tiles that look so right with the plaster walls. Plastering the hood was another important detail for us; it became a way to draw the co-op’s original character into our modern design.</p>

<p>We didn’t agree on everything. My uphill battle was to convince Matt to spend the extra money to put in taps for filtered and boiling water. As the cook of the house and the one who drinks the most water, I felt strongly that this would pay off in convenience. Matt finally agreed, and it really has.</p>
<h3>Finishing touches for the laundry</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry room was another area</a> where plumbing was key, and our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor got involved</a> there, too. We’d installed cabinets ourselves above the washer and dryer before starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen renovation</a>. However, the washer and dryer, which were included in the house purchase, had exposed hookups. We upgraded by having the contractor recess them into the wall. The dryer had been vented through a hole in the floor that looked like it was cut with a Sawzall, so we finished that, too. We invested in an on-demand hot-water heater and installed an $85 utility sink. Someday we’d like to get front-loading machines and put in a countertop to really pull that room together.</p>

<h3>Good communication with their general contractor</h3>
<p>Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractor was very communicative, which was lucky. When little things went wrong, he was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined to fix them</a> and make us happy. We are grateful to the Sweeten team for helping us find him! We spent just <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under $56,000</a> on the whole project. I’m not sure we could have pulled it off had we not both been creative managers, but it was worth it to have a kitchen we designed exactly for ourselves.</p>
<p>The renovation has <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made our home livable</a> in a way we could have never foreseen. After being over budget and tired of eating out, it kind of worked for us that eating out had become less appealing. We got to stay home and cook.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry room</a>, most of the thought goes into the washer and dryer. They do most of the hard work, right? And they are big purchase items. Nevertheless, there is one feature that, while it plays a supporting role, is indispensable: the utility room sink or laundry sink. Manufacturers are designing these basins specifically for the laundry room, offering many features with benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What distinguishes a utility sink from other sinks? They are extra deep to allow vigorous scrubbing or spraying of water with minimum splashing outside the basin. These sinks typically start at 10 inches and go up to as much as 25 inches deep versus a bathroom sink of six to eight inches deep. They come in a square or rectangular in shape, putting every inch of the basin to work. However, not all utility sinks are made alike. To determine the right choice, you&#8217;ll want to look at style and materials, taking into account what tasks will take place there and what sorts of cleansers or liquids the sink will be exposed to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Placement plays a factor in your decision, too. Keep the wet zone intact. The sink should be near the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/the-washing-machine-is-more-than-spin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer</a>—right next to it, if possible. This allows you to keep the plumbing lines together. It also means you can transfer soaked or pretreated items with a minimum of a drippy mess. The location may lock you into a particular size, and prevent you from getting that vintage double basin you had your eye on. That’s okay. Since a utility sink can come super deep, your choice will have the capacity to soak a grass-stained soccer uniform or a gravy-smeared tablecloth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the extra features available in some versions, such as a drainboard, or a second basin, you really can get a lot of use from it. Here’s what to consider before committing.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46407" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Choose your utility sink style</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with bathroom sinks, the laundry sink comes in a variety of styles for installation. What you choose from the list below has to do with personal taste, as well as any extras you may like.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wall-mount utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good option if you want to keep the floor area clear, as there is no need for a structure, such as a cabinet or legs attached to the bowl, to hold up the sink. You’ll find vintage designs, like white enamel-covered cast iron, from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>. Cast iron is strong and it won’t dent, and the enameled finish resists scratches and chipping. <a href="//www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> offers a double basin that almost looks like a trough. <a href="https://www.elkay.com/us/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elkay</a> makes an institutional model out of stainless steel with a built-in drainboard.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Freestanding utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, this style stands on its own, supported by integrated or bolted-on legs or held in a washstand-style support of a stainless-steel frame with legs. You can find models with built-in drainboards as well. The advantage of this type of sink is its portability. You can move the entire unit wherever you want, even the garage, as long as you have a hookup to water. Like the wall mount style, the pipes are concealed, and you don’t have to replace a cabinet for support below.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-rimming or drop-in utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the simplest and thriftiest choice, this sink drops into a countertop and the sink is complete once the plumbing and faucet are hooked up. There’s no seam around the sink’s perimeter to catch grime.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Undermount utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good choice when you want a seamless, smooth appearance for your countertop. The sink rests below the counter surface and almost disappears.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Apron-front utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This style was popularized in country-style or vintage-style kitchens and the look carries over well to the laundry room. The apron front is nice for deflecting water splashes when you&#8217;re standing before the sink—much like an apron.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Agitator utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some personal items may be too small for the delicate cycle of your washer or require just a quick swish with detergent. <a href="https://mtibaths.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTI</a> makes a laundry sink with a micro-jet (like a whirlpool tub) that gently agitates the items for you.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is the best material for a utility room sink?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with style, the selection here is informed by personal taste. However, each material offers its own pluses.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stainless steel</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This material won’t stain. It also won’t chip or fade and has a little give, so anything you drop inside it—like a vase—is less likely to break than it will on enameled cast iron. All in all, a smart choice if you like the look of steel.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Enameled cast iron</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enamel—a baked, powder-coated finish—coats cast iron, making it one of the strongest sinks available. This type of sink resists scratching, chipping, and staining. The enamel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives the super-rugged cast-iron surface a warmer-looking finish. Though impervious to water and resistant to stain, prolonged exposure to harsh bleach could blemish the surface. If you drop something hard on it, the enamel will chip or crack. It’s also the heaviest sink, so make sure it has sufficient support before you install it.</span></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Solid surfacing</strong></span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stain-resistant, durable, and warm in appearance, solid surfacing can stand up to a wide variety of tasks. Dings and scratches can be gently sanded out, but enlist a professional to do this, or the abraded surface will show. It can stain, too, despite some manufacturers’ claims, so best to use it for washing only.</span></p>
<h3>Adding a utility room sink to your home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits to a dedicated utility sink in the laundry room of your home. That said, washing machines come with gentle and delicate cycles, so despite all the conveniences, is a utility sink truly necessary? That’s why it’s called a utility sink; there are a lot of uses besides laundry. To name a few: handling cut flowers; potting plants; bathing a pet; washing dirty hands (or shoes) after garden or garage work; rinsing a mop; running water for crafts projects. You get the idea.</span></p>
