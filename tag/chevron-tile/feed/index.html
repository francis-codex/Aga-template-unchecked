<p style="text-align: justify;">When the deal fell through on a new, larger apartment, Zoe and Arvid decided to stay put in their Lincoln Square building in Manhattan and make their 700-square-foot one-bedroom work. But two years later, the cramped space won out, and they went on the hunt for a new home. Zoe, who admits to an unhealthy relationship with HGTV, dreamt of buying, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining</a>, and renovating an adjoining apartment. They decided to send letters to their adjacent neighbors and, to their surprise, one was looking to move, so they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What Zoe, who works in finance, and Arvid, a 3-D designer, wanted most was extra space where they could spread out and finally be able to sit down at a proper dining table instead of crouching over the coffee table. For style, the couple would need to compromise. Zoe liked mid-century modern and rustic looks while Arvid preferred clean, modern lines with a dash of industrial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor they chose</a> to combine their apartments set out to remove the two existing kitchens, rip out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and demo some internal walls to create a third bedroom. They moved into a sublet during much of the work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33713 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33690 size-chrono" title="brown-vinyl-floor-white-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" alt="brown vinyl floor in a white living room with blue wall after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33693 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" alt="renovation, apartment combination, accent wall, hardwood floors, hidden storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few “must-haves” as the couple thought through the design. Since they’re a “<span style="color: #333333;">shoes-off household,</span>” said Zoe, they needed a storage solution near the entrance. The answer, literally, was hidden in a structural column close to where they broke through the two apartments. At first, the duo tossed around ideas about how to make the column “purposeful.” Their ideas ranged from a gas fireplace to a wine fridge. Instead, they chose &#8220;practical,&#8221; she said, and created a hidden shoe closet. “Our contractor really worked with us on hardware—concealed hinges and push-open latch—and hand-sawed the baseboard to get a wider angle for the slide-out racks,” she explained. The shoe slide-out from Elfa fit the space, and to give it a sense of design, it was painted a deep accent color for some contrast and to hide dirt on the push-open door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When they opened the wall that would be the spot for the<span style="color: #333333;"> dining room</span>, the mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. “We decided to make lemonade out of this,” said Zoe and thought about how to turn it into a design element. They settled on a “partition” type of structure that took the least amount of space while letting the light through. They found Blacktable Studio to walk them through the process. As a 3-D designer, Arvid took the lead on this fun project, creating the designs and submitting his sketches. The panels were delivered two weeks later. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33707 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, dining room, edison lighting, wood table" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also liked the idea of having an extendable table for extra guests. “We never had a proper dining area before, so the prospect of having one definitely prompted a lot of imaginary dinner parties,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33709 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01-723x933.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33696 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, hardwood floors, bar seating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24-723x1067.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, hidden storage, accent wall" width="723" height="1067" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33706 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the couple’s time was spent looking for <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a></span> because it was the most prominent backdrop in the apartment and would set the tone for everything else. They wanted wide 7” to 8&#8243; European-style planks that were not too light or too dark. Arvid spent a lot of time finding the right hue, saturation, and wood grain. “It turned into a bit of an obsessive pursuit and we finally agreed on a natural color that&#8217;s very rustic with knots and saw marks. It&#8217;s a bit of a risk, but most people seem to love it,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33719 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, there was an AC/radiator below the window. More than 50 years of painting had “made it a big sad mess,” Zoe said. They wanted to cover it and also make it functional. Their Sweeten contractor listened to their input, and, she said, “we just designed it on the fly. One weekend Arvid used leftover black sample paint to paint over the heating elements behind the built-in.” This created more contrast against the outside white paint. Now the built-in&#8217;s horizontal slats look crisper, and you can barely see the mechanical elements behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other detail they focused on was smart light switches. The commonly available ones didn’t look good and the modern looking ones were way out of their budget. They took a chance on Noon Home, a start-up company selling ones around $100. “We couldn’t be happier,” she said. “The product looks modern and the app works great.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33701 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bedroom, accent wall, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33702 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-white-glass-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" alt="blue wall and a white glass door and light brown floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compromise their style preferences, they invented a design hybrid they called “Scandinavian mid-century” with a lot of black and white and plenty of geometric shapes. They learned the importance of taking time to plan a renovation. “Do a lot of showrooming and Pinteresting; both help you to know what you like,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33714 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33700 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, chevron tile, glass shower door" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once the work starts, there is little time to decide,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” Zoe measured the maximum size of her pots and condiments and knew the drawer heights she needed. The only shortfall of planning too well is that you might become too attached to certain choices. She suggests being prepared for changes and understand that sometimes, you’ll have to go with the second choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33705 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, glass shower door, chevron tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of some permit delays, the apartment was not ready for move-in after their sublet ended. For three weeks, they began an Airbnb-hopping adventure. “It&#8217;s a lot of stress, but we discovered different neighborhoods and lifestyles. We now know for sure commuting to New Jersey is not meant for us,” Zoe said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on-site</a> for the second half of the project was a big challenge and meant being around a lot of dust and living out of suitcases. Now that it’s completed, she said their new home makes them feel “happy!”</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4331" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gut a crumbling bathroom</a> in Morningside Heights, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong>:</span> A hulking seven-foot tub dominated the layout, while the ruined floors, walls, and (most of the) ceiling all begged for attention, too. The old industrial toilet was leaking, a wall of &#8217;80s-style glass-bottle tile needed to come down, and the vanity had begun literally to crumble. For Janna H. and her family, the bathroom was “disgusting.” “No matter how much we cleaned, it never felt clean,” she recalls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Janna appreciated the history of her pre-war apartment building and worked hard with her Sweeten contractor to flatter it. She avoided today’s usual combination of medicine cabinet and vanity by choosing a vintage-looking white German pedestal sink and topping it with a 12-sided beveled statement mirror crowned with a wall-mount vanity light. For much-needed storage, a designer recommended tall built-in cabinets painted to match the bathroom&#8217;s charcoal walls.</p>
<p>Janna’s first-choice wall tiles cost $12,000, so she got creative and instead used regular subway tiles in a jaunty herringbone that’s vertical, rather than tilted the typical 45 degrees.</p>
<p>The tub was swapped for a spacious, walk-in frameless glass shower on a low curb. A hand shower accompanies the luxurious oversize rain shower head.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The sink has a generous lip that serves as a functional surface when Jenna is applying makeup.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Toilet and vintage-looking 1930 Series pedestal sink, both from <a href="https://www.duravit.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duravit</a>; bathroom faucet by Hansgrohe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>She decided to renovate instead of move</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>With prices in her Fort Greene co-op building surging upward, film editor Mollie Goldstein faced a dilemma: she could cash out (but deal with the colossal hassle of moving) or remain in a building and neighborhood she loved (albeit in an outdated “starter” studio apartment). Some smart home equity math helped her see that the pros of her current place outweighed the cons, so she came to Sweeten to upgrade (inventively and colorfully!) rather than start again elsewhere.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Fort Greene homeowner Mollie Goldstein</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started noticing that prices for apartments in my Fort Greene co-op building had skyrocketed. I live in a studio, so the question of upgrading to a true one-bedroom was always on my mind. It had also been ten years since I bought my 500 square foot “starter apartment,” so I was starting to wonder if it might be time for a more “grown-up” dwelling. In short: Was now the time to cash out and buy something bigger elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon consideration, though, I realized that 1) I love my building, 2) I love my neighborhood, and 3) my apartment is the exact right size for one person and one dog. The increasing market value, however, meant that I had equity I could borrow against, and so I decided to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and make myself a new apartment without having to uproot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39988 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39989 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg" alt="bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN_Mollie_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That decision turned out to be the easy part. When it came to planning a renovation—or even finding someone to help me plan a renovation—I had no idea what I was doing and no clue how to get started. After some time on the Internet, I thought a design/build firm might make the most sense for me, since I had no confidence in my ability to either design a proper space or supervise a contractor. But when I talked to the reps for several Manhattan firms, they laughed at my budget and sent me packing. Google eventually led me to Sweeten, where I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted my project</a>. The kind staff there double-checked my budget, but at least they didn’t laugh—and neither did the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> I was eventually paired up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She was amazing, and I felt an instant rapport with her. I’d had no experience in construction, but I do collaborate for a living (I’m a film editor), and I immediately recognized that she was a gem. The design process was so much fun. Because I was renovating in order to stay put, I wanted to design spaces purely for myself. Both rooms had always been serviceable, but the hasty repairs made before I moved in ten years earlier were showing their age, and I knew there had to be better ways to take advantage of the space I had available (especially in the surprisingly large-for-NYC kitchen). It drove me crazy that the kitchen cabinets didn&#8217;t reach the ceiling (so much wasted space!) and I hated stacking my spices on top of the stove. I also had a random hole in my kitchen wall where a neighbor&#8217;s contractor had drilled through and then disappeared. The bathroom was grungy in its off-white color scheme and constantly sprouting various leaks and cracks. I also love pattern and color, and I knew I wanted to create a personalized kitchen and something other than a standard white bathroom.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen design came together very quickly. I gave my contractor a few wallpaper swatches and a random list of priorities: I wanted a dishwasher, but it had to be less obtrusive than the current model; I needed a place for cookbooks; I was desperate for more storage; and could she please include a cute little spice drawer? Within a few days she sent me a rendering that was very similar to the final product. The Hygge &amp; West wallpaper (which I’d had my eye on for a while), set the tone for our color scheme and she designed a clever built-in with a hidden-drawer dishwasher by Fisher &amp; Paykel that I loved right away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The basic layout of the bathroom was pretty easy, too, but we struggled a little more with the design. I knew I wanted something special, but I didn’t exactly know what it was. I sent my contractor a list of tiles I liked, none of which were appropriate, but she looked at them all and distilled the essence of what I was looking for, sending back the chevron marble from TileBar that we eventually went with around the tub (with its hexagon cousin for the floor). And as it happened, one of those other rejected bathroom tiles ended up as the kitchen floor — when we were looking at all our samples together, I slid that Bestile Moderna sample over to the kitchen pile, and, while neither of us had seen it coming, we both loved the black &amp; white pattern against the blue cabinetry. The floor has since become one of my absolute favorite things about the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to my contactor and her team, construction went pretty smoothly (for me). I moved out for five weeks while they dealt with all the problems of a crumbling kitchen ceiling, hauling debris out through a co-op lobby, and having to send back tile that arrived scratched. I’m sure there were a hundred other stumbling blocks that I never heard about, and I remain deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with trustworthy contractors whose standards were even higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Maggie (my dog) and I have moved back in, I’m in love with my new space. Showering in my beautiful marble shower every morning is a treat, and I cook much more—and much more enjoyably—now that I have all the counter space I need. Both the kitchen and the bathroom are neater and less cluttered than ever before now that there is a place to put everything. I’m incredibly happy that I took the renovation plunge.</p>
