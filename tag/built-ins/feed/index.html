										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Tara and Ryan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29286 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover.jpg" alt="Custom built-in bookshelves in a bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/custom-built-in-bookshelves-cover-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Claudia&#8217;s custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in bookshelves</a> in NYC</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Built-ins: Resourceful and good-looking</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll find </span><span class="s2">built-in bookshelves</span><span class="s1"> defined as entire pieces of cabinetry that are extensions of a wall. They are known for being clever space-savers and are a substantial piece of millwork. Typically custom-sized—from floor to ceiling and any width—these </span><span class="s2">built-in cabinets</span><span class="s1"> offer up maximum storage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the expertise of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors from NYC, we break down the elements that go into the cost for custom built-in bookshelves: materials, labor, and site conditions. Have a better understanding of what goes into the process of creating millwork, and how it factors into <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your renovation budget</a> as a whole.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Average costs on built-in bookshelves </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a basic internet search brings up a lot of information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation costs</a>, rates for built-in cabinets are harder to find. </span><span class="s1">This is due in part to the uniqueness of these projects—no two are the same! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That said, many millworkers rely on a linear footage model as a basis for calculating pricing, with various factors affecting overall cost. In urban areas like New York City, the range starts between $800 to $1,000 per linear foot for basic open shelving.</span></p>
<h4>Why are custom bookshelves so expensive?</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The number one misconception is the expected cost. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experienced GCs will guide you</a> on the several important factors that will attribute to creating your custom built-in bookshelves, according to NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractors Nina and Ilya</a>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Materials – “Lumber is expensive,” said Nina. “It may not look like it but there’s a lot of wood involved in turning the raw material into the finished product.” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Labor – This cost includes “preplanning, labor, studio, and shop work to prefabricate the product,” they said. “It then gets delivered to the site for installation.”</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Site condition – The existing condition of the space will determine if additional time and attention is required in designing or installing the project. Are the walls bowed or the floors uneven? Are there finishes that need to be matched to existing furniture or flooring? Other site variations can affect the price. Read more about site conditions below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Custom built-ins result in a one-of-a-kind piece made to your exact specifications that fit precisely into your space. The work that goes into a custom built-in piece often extends beyond what homeowners can imagine: Skilled experts source the materials, design, build, and perfect the unit before transporting it from the workshop to your home.</p>
<p>In the end, you are paying for both service and craftsmanship, elements that are usually missing from an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; experience.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A note on material delays</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractors note that markets have been experiencing a </span><span class="s2">backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. </span><span class="s1">“We’ve been experiencing some shortages in wood, lacquer, and paint,” said Ilya.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For NYC homeowners interested in renovating, consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">finding a licensed general contractor</span></a>, scheduling, and signing them to lock in material prices. Your contractor will be able to get your material orders in the queue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They suggest building the delays into your timeline. “It’s taking 12–16 weeks for cabinets and built-ins from start to install,” said Ilya. “Stock cabinets deliver the fastest,” he said. “The more customized the design, the more it will add to the delivery time.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get an accurate estimate, you’ll need to take a few other variables into account. For example, the average range of</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">$800 to $1,000 per linear foot usually assumes that the unit will be no taller than eight feet.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Excess height will translate into higher costs. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are other factors that can impact the budget of built-ins:</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Materials for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multitude of options includes solid woods, plywood, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), veneers, high-pressure laminate, and melamine. The good news is you’ll definitely find a style to suit your style and needs. Some points to think about:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid wood</b> is the gold standard because it is both classic and timeless. While solid wood is usually strong and sturdy, some types may crack, buckle, or shrink when subject to heat and humidity.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>MDF</b> is a good option when you’re on a budget or if you plan on painting the shelves. It is composed of dried, pressed recycled wood fibers and resin. It withstands temperature changes better than many kinds of wood. It also acts as an excellent substrate for veneers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Plywood</b> is an engineered wood like MDF but essentially made of pressed sheets of wood veneer, which is why layers are visible along the edges. Higher grades of plywood are used for cabinets and shelving, while lower grades are what you might see in housing construction and subfloors. As with solid woods, you can choose different types of plywood such as maple, pine, or birch.</span></li>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finishes for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">After choosing the materials, decide how you’d like your shelves finished. Options to consider:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Paint</b> is the go-to option. With this route, there may be a price difference based on the method of application (brush, roller, or spray), and the quality and brand of the paint you choose.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid</b> <b>lacquer </b>is a popular choice, which provides hard, glossy finishes that range in the level of sheen from clear to colored. Lacquer produces an extremely damage-resistant finish. It’s ideal for projects that see a lot of traffic, such as low shelving in a child’s room.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Varnish</b> is usually transparent but also comes in a range of glossy to satin finishes. Like lacquer, it produces a durable finish.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Unfinished</b> shelving creates a more industrial contemporary look.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">A lot of labor goes into producing a high-quality painted finish. (For a case study, read about the time and labor spent on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/"><span class="s3">Kate and Arthur’s DIY cabinets</span></a>.) The entire process can take up to five days and include up to four coats of primer and finish. Compared to two to three coats of a high-quality clear lacquer that can be applied in as little as one day. The additional labor costs easily offset the savings of less expensive, “paint-grade” materials.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Site conditions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The type of building structure you live in—house, apartment, walk-up, or elevator—contributes to pricing differentials when it comes to built-ins. Projects in apartments often take longer to deliver and install than those in houses. “Labor costs increase when materials need to be maneuvered in a walk-up building,” Ilya said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In addition to the logistics of parking and unloading on a busy city street, some apartment buildings have strict work hours for contractors. This can limit the amount of work that they can finish in one day, stretching a one-day installation into two.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features and components of custom bookshelves</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Simple open shelving is the least expensive built-in option. Most experts don’t calculate costs per additional drawer or door. However, the more features you include, the higher the overall cost. Glass doors or shelves, a floating desk, and lighting all add cost in time and materials.</span></p>
<p>Custom built-ins may conjure up visions of grand homes but, in fact, are great space-savers in smaller homes. These cabinets are the touch of millwork to up your storage game in any room. <span class="s4">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span class="s5">renovate with the best contractors in NYC</span></a>.</span></p>
