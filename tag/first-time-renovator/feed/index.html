<h3>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Martha</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were living in a great apartment nearby for four years. But after my divorce, I knew I needed to find something to purchase in order to control my housing costs. Since I’m a full-time, working, single parent, the more I can get my costs under control, the better off we’ll be in the long term.<b> </b>I had an amazing real estate agent who looked at places in my price range for a full year.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-02.jpg" alt="Living room and bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-02-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The apartment I ended up buying was the first home I saw when I started my search! But it needed so much work that I automatically said no and we moved on. After my realtor encouraged me to take another look, I saw it with new eyes. I saw the potential in it, and not just the work that needed to be done.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the biggest challenges was that I had a tight timeline—I was paying rent along with a mortgage plus maintenance, and I couldn’t afford that for long. So I had to use only <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials that were in stock</a>. It was limiting, but I think we made do! I wanted to open things up and make a home that was cozy and colorful, that would reflect our personalities and be welcoming.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span class="s1">The first few days during the demo were the best part of the process, because I could finally see what things were really going to look like.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The highest priority with the renovation was to cure the ugliness! The apartment hadn’t been touched since the &#8217;70s. There was fake wood paneling in the hallways, old linoleum plunked down over the amazing original hardwood floors, and layers and layers of paint. The space was tight and there was a lot of wasted space in the kitchen that I wanted to find a way to utilize.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first few days during the demo were the best part of the process, because I could finally see what things were really going to look like. I was most excited to take down the wall between the kitchen and the living room. It made all the difference in creating an open, warm area. Once we knocked that down, it gave us space for a table and chairs that we wouldn’t have otherwise. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation-red hardware-stainless steel sink-gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, we installed new custom cabinets, plus more cabinets next to the stove. I went for a 30-inch stainless-steel farmer’s sink, quartz countertops, and a new stove. My favorite thing in the whole house is the kitchen backsplash; I love that funky design.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My contractor really wanted me to lay a new floor on top of the old one. But I loved the color variation in the original wood so I insisted it stay. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kept all the original flooring</a>, just refinished and stained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest challenge was that the apartment has zero closets. I didn’t have the budget to build them so we bought a couple of big wardrobes and a funky metal gym locker for a linen closet and made it work. At least we had more vertical space to work with because after we removed the dropped ceilings, we gained at least two feet!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bedroom-with-french-doors"  class="alignnone wp-image-43715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01.jpg" alt="bedroom with french doors and hardwood floors and fan after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Martha-bedroom-doors-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m a first-time renovator, so I really needed someone who would listen, do good work, deliver on time, and stay within budget and I got all of that. My Sweeten contractor was great and I really had no headaches with my renovation, which is amazing! </span><span class="s1">He was really communicative, and anytime something needed to be changed or wasn’t going to work according to plan, he explained everything to me. Then we worked towards solutions together, which was so helpful. It went as smoothly as one could ask for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re renovating, remember that there will inevitably be something or some things that don’t go according to your plan. Try to see the big picture and not freak out about the details.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wanted our forever home to be a place of joy that you can see. Our home makes me feel free.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Martha and Sofia, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A remodel brings major storage points and a new bath</h2>
<p><em>Mimi’s new one-bed, one-bath apartment in Manhattan’s neighborhood of Gramercy checked off quite a few boxes. But revamping an outdated bathroom and installing new wood flooring would just be the start to making the 600-square-foot home the way she wanted. With an architect’s plans in hand, she needed help getting over the hump of the process of finding a general contractor. Mimi found one at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, who turned the drawings into reality, including a walk-in closet and an 18-foot-long bookshelf. Read on to see how she even managed a vacation in the middle of her renovation.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40489 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><em>Guest blog post by homeowner Mimi</em></p>
<p>I had been looking for quite a while—nearly a year, on and off—before I found my apartment. For the longest time, I only viewed turnkey apartments because I was intimidated by the idea of renovating my own space and didn’t even know where I’d start. But no space had the exact features I was looking for, so I had to expand my search.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40490 size-full" title="homeowner portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg" alt="homeowner portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40499" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before.jpg" alt="before floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40498" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After.jpg" alt="after floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-Floorplan-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Finally, I found an apartment that felt like the right size and fit for me living as a single twenty-something in the city—great neighborhood and convenient to work, plenty of light (very important since my previous apartment was on the second floor and never saw any direct sunlight), previously renovated kitchen, and a good amount of closet space. There were just a few features I wanted to update before I moved in: the bathroom was old and hadn’t been touched in at least a decade, and I wasn’t a fan of the original ‘70s parquet floors. I had also been dreaming for years of having enough bookshelf space in my apartment to hold all the books I want to accumulate and, of course, I had to have a walk-in closet.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">My contractor helped me design and create my dream floor-to-ceiling bookshelf and media center—an impressive 18 feet of bookshelf space.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I put in an offer that was accepted shortly before Thanksgiving, so I knew that the closing process might take a while given the upcoming holidays. Because of that lag, I was anxious to get the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation plans approved by the co-op board</a> prior to closing so that I could start construction as soon as closing occurred. I decided to work with architect Liz Mickey, AIA to help me visualize and design the new layout of the apartment, as well as draw up floor plans so I had something concrete I could submit to the co-op board. She gave me some great ideas, so by closing, I had a very solid idea of how I wanted the apartment to look before I moved in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40488 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>At that point, I hit a bit of a wall. Though I had a clear vision of the renovations I wanted, I was still very intimidated by the process of finding a general contractor, especially with the number of renovation horror stories I had heard from friends and just browsing online. I ended up coming across Sweeten through its blog while I was searching for both décor inspiration and renovation budget costs in the city. I decided to give it a shot and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a>.</p>

<p>The process of being matched with and choosing a contractor on Sweeten felt seamless—I found someone who understood what I was looking for and was eager to make my vision come to life. <span style="color: #333333;">The<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4407" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sweeten contractor I chose</a> helped me design and create my dream floor-to-ceiling bookshelf and media center, which spanned the entire length of the dining and living room wall—an impressive 18 feet of bookshelf space</span>, which I expect I won’t be able to fill for many years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40483" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06.jpg" alt="closet leading into bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40485 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-08.gif" alt="bedroom vanity" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Between the bedroom and the bathroom, a dingy closet space was converted into a walk-through closet with pocket doors to help save space and make sure the small bathroom didn’t feel cluttered. Since all the fixtures in the bathroom looked quite old, I decided on a gut renovation of the bathroom with new tile and a much larger and brighter mirror and lighting fixture. The only minor hiccup came when my super informed me I wouldn’t be able to replace the old cast-iron bathtub because of how it was connected to the downstairs apartment; we decided to just use a bathtub liner instead so the tub would be refreshed and feel as new as the rest of the bathroom.</p>

<p>I was especially glad I found a contractor I could trust because I had actually preplanned a three-week long vacation overseas before I knew I was going to be in the middle of renovations (and ended up breaking my phone two days in!). I was a bit nervous leaving right in the middle of all of the construction, but my Sweeten contractor gave me a lot of confidence that the project could proceed without me. So I picked out all of the finishes I wanted, ordered the fixtures, packed my bags and left right in the middle of the project. Sure enough, by the time I got back, the job was nearly complete!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40491 size-full" title="cat" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg" alt="cat" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>I almost can’t believe how easy the process was, especially being able to leave for such a long time and come back to a nearly finished apartment, which was everything that I had hoped for. I moved in just a couple of weeks after I came back from vacation, and have had so much fun continuing to decorate the space and make it my own. It really is everything that I hoped for in my first apartment!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Get the lowdown on their projects and advice</h2>
<p>No matter the level of experience, the key to tackling a renovation is being prepared for the expected—and the unexpected. When renovators, beginners and pros alike, come to Sweeten, they get the guarantee of a licensed contractor specifically matched to their project, plus the support of an entire company whose number one priority is making sure the project goes right. These first-timers shared their reno journeys—and what they learned along the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38247 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovators" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The biggest components of Sheilaja and Sergio’s renovation revolved around entertaining. They wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize their tight galley kitchen</a> and reimagine the foyer as a dining area. In the cook space, they decided to extend the cabinetry for more storage and chose a glossy white finish that reflects light. Instead of running upper cabinets along both sides, the couple opted for floating shelves, making the space feel wider and longer. To create a dining room, they removed two closets in the foyer, allowing enough space for bookshelves and a full table and chairs. “As first-time renovators, we greatly appreciated how responsive our Sweeten contractor was to our calls and emails throughout the renovation. In the few instances where something needed to be adjusted or redone, he was willing to take the extra steps to make sure we were satisfied with the outcome,” Sheilaja shared.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35193 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovators" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-723x482.jpg" alt="portrait " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Jen bought her first apartment eager to renovate the kitchen, but decided to live with it to get a feel for how she’d actually use the space.“I had a pretty clear vision of the aesthetics and giving myself that extra year solidified those design decisions,” she said. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she got started on the renovation</a>, a wall came down between the living area and kitchen. She connected the separate spaces with a peninsula for more counter space and a built-in spot to eat. The rest of the minimalistic cook space came together with sleek cabinets, barely-there hardware, and integrated appliances. She loved the transformation so much, choosing a favorite element was nearly impossible, though she did have a few words of wisdom for future renovators. For one, start putting together a materials list before you even hire a contractor. Jen assembled a spreadsheet with everything from appliances to light fixtures to keep track of things she loved and to see if they went on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>After mishaps with a kitchen designer and a year off from the process, Racquel began her kitchen renovation with a Sweeten general contractor by her side. Though there were a few issues with deliveries and delays, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kensington-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project was complete</a> within the three-week window her contractor had quoted. Including the time spent before she found Sweeten, Racquel did put more time into the renovation than expected. Her patience and perseverance proved worth it. “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34636 size-chrono" title="first-time renovator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>Lynn and Craig’s number one request for an apartment? An in-unit washer and dryer. They found a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half bathroom in a perfect location, with great bones, but no laundry. Ultimately they decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackle both of the apartment’s bathrooms</a>. Their contractor found a spot in their 24-square-foot half bathroom to install a laundry area by tapping into the sink’s water line. To solve another problem in the space, a lingering smell of cat urine, the walls and floor were gutted and rebuilt. While Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed them to renovate without an architect, in retrospect they would’ve hired one. “Renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you,” Craig said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35896 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>After losing out on several homes, Sonali and Shalaj were surprised when their bid on a two-bedroom co-op in the Financial District of Manhattan was accepted. Once reality hit, the new homeowners came to a conclusion: they had to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/financial-district-couple-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut renovate the ‘70s style apartment</a>. In addition to reimagining the bathroom and bedroom, they decided the living area should be an open concept. Most of their budget and effort went into updating the kitchen, including appliances and materials. Fortunately, a friend advised them to set aside a 30% buffer on top of their budget. “The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by. Extra costs included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned,” Sonali said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Metro Gris 12 in. x 24 in. porcelain floor tiles and Greecian white herringbone backsplash: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bypassing the butterflies to achieve their dream space<br />
<b></b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating your home—from changing the layout of the kitchen to installing new flooring—is a process that relies heavily on balancing the big-picture vision with its finer details. Neophyte renovators may feel at a disadvantage to their more experienced peers, but with Sweeten on their team, they’ve got the best of both worlds: a fresh perspective paired with the support of a company dedicated to making sure the renovation goes right. Below, six renovators recount how they dealt with challenges during their first major renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32402 mb-0 size-chrono" title="happy-couple-renovated-home" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-723x482.jpg" alt="happy couple in their renovated home" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Profile-3.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Purchasing an apartment in Manhattan inspired Heather to begin dreaming about renovating while her boyfriend, Eric, secretly planned a proposal to coincide with the acceptance of their offer. Rather than putting any of their plans on hold, the newbie renovators—and newly engaged couple—<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to go through with the remodel</a> before the wedding. Focusing on the kitchen and new flooring throughout, they prepared for a tight timeline. When the seller delayed the closing, Heather and Eric rolled up their sleeves to keep things on track. “With this delay, we, along with our contractor, had to personally roll our new kitchen cabinets across two New York City avenues!” Eric said. “Truthfully, we look back and are still unsure how we were able to sketch, design, renovate, and implement all of our changes without any background or experience in any of these areas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31709 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Olivia and Greg's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath12-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Olivia and Greg <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-co-op-reno-designed-to-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off the reno</a> of their Upper West Side co-op while expecting their first child. With a list of must-haves that included the kitchen, two bathrooms, and closet build-out in the master bedroom, the couple learned to be patient and check on progress as often as possible to avoid problems later down the line. One smart tip they shared with us: identify a set of priorities and keep your eye on the prize. “Renovating can be addicting!” Olivia said, “Once you start, you’ll begin to realize all the imperfections in your home, which could add on tens of thousands of dollars to your project. But don’t get distracted. Stick with the original plan; you can always renovate again at another point.” The couple’s fierce determination helped them complete their remodel just in time for the birth of their son, Max.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32888 size-chrono" title="Bellamy and Zak's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Bellamy-Grindl-Townhouse-1stFloor-18-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One year after buying a 2,400-square-foot brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Bellamy and Zak found themselves <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning their first major renovation</a>. They relocated the rental unit from the top floor to the garden level and got to work on updates throughout the first and second floors. While staying on budget was critical in order to get everything done, there were a few things that Bellamy didn’t mind paying extra for. “Now that the house is done, I am so thankful we splurged on what we wanted—replacing the windows, skim-coating, and repointing the brick; those are some of my favorite things in the house,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31301 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-dining-space-natural-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg" alt="gray dining space in a natural wood flooring and a dining table with man working after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-SaulCunow-KitchenBath14.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten years after winning the housing lottery for an apartment near Manhattan’s South Street Seaport, Kate and Saul returned to the apartment with the intention of making it their home. With an eye on future resale value, they painted walls, replaced flooring, and remodeled the kitchen and bathroom. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-affordable-housing-co-op-hits-a-reno-lottery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looking back on the reno</a>, Kate let us know that she didn’t feel prepared for all the work that their contractor&#8217;s team needed to do on a daily basis. Another thing she learned: you need to be ready to explain what you want in each space so that the contractor can execute it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay and Roger replaced the cabinets, countertops, and appliances in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their co-op’s outdated kitchen</a> in Ditmas Park. In hindsight, Lindsay said she wishes she spent more time deciding on appliances and included items like the cabinet hardware, faucet, and sink in her budget from the get-go. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval,” she said. Plus, there might an unexpected wait to get plans approved. Lindsay said: “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33423 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Melissa's apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Longtime renter Melissa became a homeowner after buying a 500-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper West Side. Once her offer was accepted, her boyfriend proposed (we’re seeing a trend here!) which meant that the home would need some serious storage to accommodate the two of them. The solution? <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving/">Adding built-ins to every inch</a> of available space. To keep the custom storage from feeling bulky and making the apartment feel smaller, Melissa said: “All the materials were chosen with the idea of making the space feel larger, which seems to be driven by a more modern look.” A simple color palette and clean lines allowed her to incorporate some more traditional elements as well, like pendant lights, the kitchen backlash—reminiscent of old-fashioned tin ceilings—and faux-stone tile in the bath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32092 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowners Sophia and Leon" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-17.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuh29ImbX28HxWHcMK42a3-pAyMQ" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s</a> newly purchased 3-bedroom unit needed to be gutted, but the couple had concerns about staying on budget&#8230;a gut reno sounded expensive! Their Sweeten general contractor guided the newbie renovators in making budget-friendly decisions, advising on what to keep (appliances that were in working condition) and what to replace (farewell, dated cabinets). Although the prospect of a gut renovation was daunting, Sophia was delighted with the results AND the money they were able to save, and said: “This was a great first-time renovating experience and we’re so happy in our new home!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Christine-Bathroom.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32093 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowner Christine" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Christine-Bathroom-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea of buying her first home and remodeling the bathroom felt overwhelming to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a>. But a long search for the right space changed her mind. “No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?” Christine said. She posted her project on Sweeten and was matched with a general contractor whose past work had a similar aesthetic to the look she hoped to achieve: minimalism with a warm and cozy vibe. “My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free.” Her advice to first-time renovators? “Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated space, I promise.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it came time to choose a general contractor for her kitchen renovation, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmu2-VnBrd367LlQU0TW2RVF2m3Q" rel="noopener">Amanda</a> wasn’t sure how to decide between bids. A phone call with her Sweeten client services contact helped her compare bids, considering the pros and cons of each contractor and how they stacked up as a potential fit for her project. The guidance gave Amanda the confidence she needed to make the right decision, getting her renovation off to a great start. Her contractor’s close attention to detail allowed him to quickly resolve issues, enabling them to finish the job within the one-month timeframe. Amanda’s advice to other first-time renovators is simple. “Trust the contractor! He knows what he’s doing and how long it’ll take to do it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Felix-Bathroom.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32095 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Homeowner Felix and her daughter Nova" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Felix-Bathroom-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>

Her Sweeten general contractor was patient and willing to jump in whenever she needed him. &#8220;That was really why I went with him,&#8221; Felix said. &#8220;He stuck with me through the procrastination!” From that point onward, everything was smooth sailing. In the end, Felix described the overall renovation process as &#8220;surprisingly easy.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After being stuck in a “contractor no-man’s-land,” receiving bids from handymen whose skills didn’t meet the requirements of the job and contractors who were only interested in larger projects, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-kitchen-basks-in-natural-light/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-kitchen-basks-in-natural-light/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523543728488000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCEnV3PMnvA5pBouGAXmYXZhsADg" rel="noopener">Anne and Michael</a> came to Sweeten. “We posted the project and the budget and got serious responses from contractors specifically interested in a project of our size,” Anne said. &#8220;Our contractor helped us source appliances, counters, and backsplash tile, which we found really helpful as first-timers.&#8221; Their advice: “It’s such a cliche, but it&#8217;s going to take longer than you think.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29851 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-old-bath-gets-investment-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt</a> purchased his first home, a 360-square-foot apartment in Park Slope, in July 2013. Over the next few years, he saved up to renovate the bathroom. “I wanted a complete bathroom renovation not only to feel better about the space, but also as an investment,” he said. Matt found Sweeten and posted his project, working with the client services team to guide his decision-making. He remodeled his bath, creating a clean and refreshed space with plenty of storage. “Because this was my first renovation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful to Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>When happily-ever-after meets home renovation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or you’ve owned a home before, taking the plunge and moving in with your partner is both thrilling and terrifying. Throw a renovation into the mix and suddenly the notion of a shared space that’s both personal and cohesive can seem impossible—especially if you’re a first-time renovator as well. Take heart that it can be done. Read on to meet five couples who combined romance and renovation with help from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30655 size-chrono" title="Amy and Nick" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Amy_and_Nick_Apartment-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners and renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Nick</a> wanted to avoid a renovation at all costs. Things changed when they came across an outdated 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that was just the right size and layout for them to imagine their home together. The couple moved in and started saving for a renovation. While remodeling, they refreshed the worn-out bath and tore out the triangular-shaped kitchen, replacing it with new cabinets, appliances, and a custom 10-foot-long island topped with sparkling Carrara marble. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. “We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29015 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom02-1-723x482.jpg" alt="first-time renovator" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These homeowners</a> spent a year dreaming about the possibilities of renovating their two-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn—their first as a couple—before they kicked things off by hiring a general contractor. Despite the many windows and breathtaking views of the city, the apartment felt crowded and closed-off. They opened up the layout by removing the wall separating the kitchen from the living room and installed an island—a feature that they had both loved from their childhood kitchens. The changes improved the overall flow and flooded the space with sunlight. Creative choices—from the bright green backsplash in the kitchen to the warm gold fixtures in the bath—allowed them to inject their personality into the space.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua</a>, a newly engaged couple, planned on transforming Erica’s apartment—the home she had grown to love, despite its quirks, over the past 10 years—into the perfect space to begin their new lives together. The renovation focused on opening up and updating the kitchen. &#8220;We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy,&#8221; says Erica. Custom cabinets replaced builder-grade cabinetry and a new peninsula provided generous storage and a place for the duo to dine. &#8220;Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet. I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree,&#8221; she said. After speaking to their contractor, &#8220;Joshua was right. The floors needed to be replaced.&#8221;<span class="s1"> </span>The apartment is now cozy—instead of cramped—and overflowing with natural light. At the end of the renovation, Erica found that there was so much more to love about her home.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/becky-kitchen-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becky and Sarah</a> moved in together with the intention of renovating their kitchen, but the project was put on hold. When it came time to renovate, the planning stage involved a few different versions until they settled on the right design; an open kitchen with shelves instead of upper cabinets. To make sure there was enough storage, they installed an island with pull-out drawers and nestled the fridge within cabinetry. While the project was stressful at times, the results were well worth the effort. Once the punch list was complete, the couple got engaged. “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While searching for their first home together, Cecilia was looking for a place within walking distance of shops and subway stations, while Jonathan wanted a fixer-upper with plenty of square footage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple</a> combined their requirements and fed the list into a computer code that Jonathan had written to find his first apartment. The code scoured real estate websites and narrowed down the results so that they only looked at the ones that met their needs. Renovating their home led them to a unified design for the main living spaces, while also allowing them to create their own spaces where it mattered the most: in this case, his and her bathrooms.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16387 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen.jpg" alt="sophia's upper west side kitchen renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sophia-kitchen-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Sophia, Manhattan homeowner</span><span id="more-16382"></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For five years, I had been parked in a 400 square foot rent-stabilized apartment at a great location on the Upper West Side. As a single person, I felt like it was spacious. When my husband moved <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1178174334" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">in three years</span></span> ago, 400 square feet seemed &#8220;cozy,&#8221; and once I gave birth to our son, Apollo, the space became woefully inadequate. It just could not contain the mountain of stuff that accompanies caring for a baby.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We entered the Manhattan housing market and had a terrible time for a few months; we made several offers and were outbid on everything. All of the two-bedroom apartments within our price range were such wrecks that with construction costs included, they would have been over budget. Two things we knew for sure: we were determined to stay within our budget and I didn&#8217;t want anything that would need the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it. For the latter, as the saying goes, &#8220;famous last words&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Just when we were about to give up on our search, I decided to go to one last open house for a unit that had been on the market for months. Unbelievably, it was listed at a price that was within our budget and had three bedrooms, even larger than what we were originally hoping to get. It needed some work, but the maintenance was so low that we were convinced even with renovation costs, it would still be within our monthly budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The best part was thanks to an unusual catwalk outside the front door &#8212; the apartment actually received three exposures during the day and thus, a ton of light. But inside, it was similar to a “bento box” with lots of walls separating each of the living spaces and blocking all of that great light. The kitchen was dated and the whole thing needed to be gutted.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16388" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-Before-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We posted our project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> after hearing from friends who had also found a general contractor on the website. We liked the ability to review candidates’ work online and we were extremely drawn to design-build companies for holistic decisions that would be more likely to contain costs. Sweeten introduced us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Experts Paulina and Albert</a> and I was hooked on their work. I loved the design of their projects and after speaking with their references, we hired them immediately. We were able to get a running start designing the kitchen with Paulina while we were still in the process of closing. As soon as we closed, Paulina&#8217;s group was able to go in and start demolition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16389" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-During-01-02-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We went to see the apartment on the first day of demolition at the end of the day. As we stood there in the quiet dusk with the post-demolition dust slowly settling all around us, we both looked at each other with our mouths open…and in a moment of panic, I wondered if they could just put it all back the way it had been and pretend like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Once the debris cleared and the actual construction began, things were looking up. Bringing the dividing wall down between the kitchen and living room made a tremendous difference. Light poured in through the kitchen and into the hallways.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16393" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" alt="upper west side kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Paulina and Albert custom-built the entire kitchen and it looks absolutely fantastic. We opted for classic white custom cabinets and we absolutely love the open shelving that Paulina incorporated per our request. The bookcase that transitions between the living room and kitchen was designed by her, and we love that it is a more natural ending point to the backsplash. Paulina persuaded us that wood countertops would require significant upkeep, so we opted instead for a simple quartz counter that has been great.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We tried to stay within our budget as much as possible and in doing so, decided to keep the perfectly fine (if dated) stove to hopefully be swapped out at a later date. Leon shopped with Paulina to find a narrower and more modern fridge and a new microwave that would match the width of the stove. Leon did the backlighting himself using an electronic LED strip that he controls through his phone. It can wirelessly connect and change colors to reflect the weather or the changes in the stock market. (<em>Editor’s note &#8212; ahem, what?? The stock market!?</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also went with a slightly more modern version of a rustic farmhouse sink and purchased our simple matte black pulls and handles from Ikea.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Our expert team was always professional during all of our interactions, even the ones when we were definitely playing the demanding and nervous first-time renovator role. I&#8217;m not sure we will ever do anything with the word &#8220;gut&#8221; in it again, but this was a great first-time renovating experience and we are so happy in our new home!</p>
