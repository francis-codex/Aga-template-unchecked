Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale, especially if you know you&#8217;ll outgrow your current home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers an overview of the best home upgrades for resale value.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, minor kitchen remodel that costs $23,452 has a resale value of $18,206 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range, major kitchen remodel that costs $68,490 has a resale value of $40,127 and recoups <b>58%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom remodel that costs $21,377 has a resale value of $13,688 and recoups<b> 64%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale bathroom remodel that costs $67,106 has a resale value of $37,995 and recoups <b>56%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range bathroom addition that costs $49,598 has a resale value of $26,807 and recoups<b> 54%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Small </span><span class="s1">home resale upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">The best exterior home upgrades for resale value</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range wooden deck addition that costs $14,360 has a resale value of $10,355 and recoups <b>72%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range fiber-cement siding replacement that costs $17,008 has a resale value of $13,195 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing a mid-range steel entry door for a cost of $1,881 has a resale value of $1,294 and recoups <b>68%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>

<h3>Starting a major renovation</h3>
<p>Sandra is an educator and I&#8217;m a music movement instructor.  Our three children are Julian, 24, Abigail, 18, and Avery,17, plus we have a 2-year-old dog, Blue. We purchased our first home in 1997 after living on the top floor of a private home located in South Slope, Brooklyn, for about seven years.</p>
<p>We did not focus on any major renovations to the house until 2018. The house is a charming red brick Tudor-style home originally built by an Armenian family in 1922.</p>

<h3>Hiring a contractor</h3>
<p>Our vision for our project really began with a desperate need to makeover our &#8217;70s kitchen. Eventually, we began to see that the rest of the main level was also crying out for a change. Sweeten was a very interesting website that my wife spotted while doing her research. We loved the stories and photos displayed with the recommendations of contractors. We had site visits with two and immediately felt a connection with the Sweeten contractor we would ultimately hire.  We shared our concerns regarding how difficult it will be to tackle an old house and, of course, our budget.</p>
<p>We loved that the house did not intimidate our contractor at all. We shared our ideas and all our concerns with him and within two weeks, a proposal was handed to us that included a renovation for the kitchen, the entire main level floor, and important necessary improvements of the entire lower level family room.</p>

<h3>Changing the layout</h3>
<p>One of the challenges we faced was how to end the years of living with drafts and cold temperatures in our home.  The draft we experienced came from the dining window where the large permanent air conditioner sat on the ledge for years, the office space (now the sunroom) that included nine old large windows, and the old kitchen exit door.</p>
<p>We also could not see nor understand how to expand the space for comfort. After a solid consultation with our Sweeten contractor, permission was granted to include in our home improvement budget a cooling and heating system and knock down existing walls in order to create new space and bring in outside light.</p>

<h3>Knocking out a door</h3>
<p>The most exciting part of the project for us was eliminating the old <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> door and replacing it with a large window that brings in sunlight. Adjacent, the office space was transformed into a sunroom with a huge new pantry for multiple-purpose storage and a new glass deck door.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have developed a new confidence working with our contractor and hope that very soon we will have him back to renovate the upper level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We considered tearing down all the walls of the house but had a change of heart because of the mosaic of details spotted throughout the house.  Our contractor&#8217;s wise tip with our project was to keep in mind that the house was built decades ago and that we can save so much of the budget if we come up with a fresh new look without disturbing too much of the original plumbing, electrical, and gas connections.</p>

<h3>Decluttering and blending materials</h3>
<p>We both shared a love of antiques and traditional aesthetics. We have lived in our house for 20 years and never updated our look. We realized that a simpler, uncluttered, Zen look is what we needed. We traded the original maple-colored parquet floors throughout the main floor, including the kitchen, with a delicious chocolate-colored plank wood that reminds us of rich gardening soil. We also wanted to include materials and hues that immediately took us back to nature—silver grays, dairy whites, and galaxy black. The color of the walls was chosen as a canvas to complement all of the materials chosen.</p>

<h3>Working as a team</h3>
<p>We owe it to Sweeten for matching us with the general contractor for our project. He did nothing but listen until he totally understood the vision and ran with it. He led our construction journey in such a peaceful transformation. We loved how he unselfishly gave us the liberty to do some of our own research on materials we really loved, and then with only some of the higher-priced items would he suggest his connections at a lower price to keep us on the budget without losing the integrity of the look. The budget was our biggest concern with our renovation and he always kept it in check. His team was just as amazing. We enjoyed having them arrive on our project every day and some weekends.</p>

<h3>A stunning outcome</h3>
<p>We cannot express how much we love the new kitchen shared with the dining space, living room, sunroom, and our newly improved lower-level family chill room. The entire new space gives us a sensational feel of living outside instead of inside. We are completely covered with so much light and warmth. We recently celebrated our son, Julian’s 24th birthday by inviting 22 guests ages 17-26. They had all visited our home prior to the renovation and they literally felt as if they were in another house. They could not get over the transformation.</p>
<p>We are thrilled our Sweeten contractor truly helped us to create a Zen space that works well with everything, including our antique pieces. I really believe that something needs to be said about the old working in a harmonious manner with the new. We have developed new confidence working with our contractor and we are hoping that very soon we will have him back to renovate the upper level including the family bathroom. But first, we must concentrate on building, once again, our home improvement budget.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are that once you find the right townhouse (good bones, ideal location, right price) in New York City, the space is going to need some work. After all, many of these houses—particularly classic brownstones—date back to the late 1800 and early 1900s. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke to Sweeten’s founder and CEO, Jean Brownill, and <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/chris-halliburton?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Halliburton</a>, associate broker of investment sales at <a href="https://www.compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compass</a>, to put together a comprehensive guide about the questions to ask before you buy and how to get started on your townhouse renovation plan once the papers are signed, sealed, and delivered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Questions to Ask During Your Search for a Townhouse</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a townhouse to renovate, you probably already have an idea of the kind of home and lifestyle you’re looking to create. Perhaps you&#8217;re tired of neighbors stomping above you and dealing with your restrictive co-op board, or you are drawn to the dream of owning your very own roof terrace and backyard—aren’t we all? Or maybe you’d also like rental income to offset the cost of home ownership, or you’re an investor looking to maximize rental income.  Whatever your motivations, your townhouse renovation search should be narrowed to the properties that will allow you to create the lifestyle you’re looking for. Here are the questions to ask during your search.</span></p>
<h4><b>1.) What’s the building’s history?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you gather information about the soundness of the property. New York City’s </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Buildings (DOB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a great site where you can look up the history of the property and see the violations, complaints, as well as applications and permits for prior work done to the property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for red flags, and use the information to determine whether prior work—especially structural changes or alterations to the plumbing, electrical, and mechanicals—has been executed properly. </span><a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property Shark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another place where you can access comprehensive, publicly available information about the property in question.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-brown-floor-white-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-31419 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="white kitchen with brown floor and white kitchen cabinets with recessed lights on ceiling after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>AJ and Ray’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>2.) What’s the actual square footage versus the buildable square footage?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many townhouses are on lots much larger than the current building footprint. For example, brownstones are often on 100-foot lots, but the building itself may only be 20’ x 35’. Chris explains that these properties can often be built back with extensions ranging from ten to 30 feet long, depending on the floor area ratio (FAR). The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/residence-districts-r1-r10.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAR is determined by the zoning designation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in New York City, the Zoning Resolution designates ten residential districts. For example, a lot that is 20’ x 100’ in an R7-2 zone that has a FAR of 3.44 allows you to put up a 6,880-square-foot building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be able to expand vertically. This is almost always a given, Chris says, although you may be constrained by landmark preservation requirements (see below). Similarly, you should explore excavation possibilities for creating a cellar. While below-grade space is not counted in the square footage, it is often useful to add space below for mechanicals or storage, even if it is not livable. By storing these elements underground, you can free up space above grade to maximize your living space and/or rental income potential.</span></p>

<h4><b>3.) What are the existing conditions?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information that you gather via city databases, pay attention to the existing conditions of the building. Are there signs of water damage, mold, or termites? Also be aware of outside forces beyond an owner’s control—is there a lot of ongoing or planned construction in the area?</span></p>
<p>If there is an empty lot next door, find out what is happening there. Chris points out that the construction of tunnels for the Second Avenue subway expansion was a major issue for surrounding properties, not only in terms of noise and inconvenience but also with structural damage related to shifting foundations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it currently a single-family dwelling that you intend to turn into a two-family? Or vice-versa? Be prepared to hire an architect if so.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1bZ07c4-A0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40881 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h4><b>4.) Is the property landmarked or in a historic district?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/about/about-lpc.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landmark Preservation Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is New York City’s governing agency for preserving buildings and sites that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant. Many brownstone townhouses happen to be in designated historic districts—there are a total of more than 36,000 landmark properties in 141 historic districts and extensions throughout the five boroughs, according to the LPC’s website.</span></p>
<p>If the townhouse you’re considering is protected, you will need to submit any planned changes to the LPC for review at the same time that you submit plans to the DOB. Chris explains, “Anything that the LPC approves will be approved 99 percent of the time by the DOB. But it’s not the case vice versa.” In particular, any changes to the façade will be scrutinized by the LPC. For example, while a back extension will not affect the view of the building from the street, adding floors will. If you want to add to the top of the building, you may be required to start 20 feet back from the front of the building, so that the additional floor can’t be seen from the street.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LPC review will add extra time to your townhouse renovation, so this should be a consideration, especially if you are looking to bring in rental income on a deadline.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Financing Your Townhouse Renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining financing for a townhouse purchase and renovation is essentially the same process as a condo purchase and renovation (co-ops are the outlier here). This is because a townhouse, like a condo, is real property. You can consult </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/financing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Sweeten guide on financing home renovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are financing both the purchase of the property as well as the renovation, you have a few options (Jean advises consulting a professional to see what’s best for your situation).</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction loan and a permanent mortgage separately. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you will need to research two separate loans and pay for two sets of closing costs. Some lenders only provide construction loans, while others will only make combination loans. Construction loans typically run for 12 months or less and are subject to an adjustable interest rate that resets quarterly or sometimes monthly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction-to-permanent loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This combination instrument simplifies the process because you only need to take out one loan and pay closing costs once. It’s the more popular option for this reason. While construction is ongoing, you only pay interest on the outstanding balance, and then it is converted to a mortgage after the renovation is complete. You may, however, pay more for the permanent mortgage because the need for a combination has reduced your lender options.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Who You’ll Need On Your Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for a townhouse to renovate, it’s important to gather the experts who will not only help you get the job done right, but who can help you assess whether it’s a project worth tackling in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, you’ll need to line up several professionals early on, including structural engineers, electricians, and plumbers. Chris suggests that you bring these pros in for site visits prior to signing the contract so that you don’t “end up buying a money pit.” He estimates that you could have all these consultations done for roughly $1,500 to $2,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to general contractors, Jean understands firsthand the importance of having a professional you can trust. “When I started to renovate my own Brooklyn brownstone, I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor,” she said. “If I can make a wrong choice, anyone can.” She started Sweeten to help homeowners find licensed and vetted contractors and to ultimately renovate fearlessly to create a home they love.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150923230"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A townhouse is a common style of housing in cities and suburbs. Townhouses tend to be multi-floor units with private entrances. Townhouses share one or more walls with adjoining townhouse units; which differentiates them from single-family homes. Townhouse units may have small front or back yards, balcony spaces, or covered porches. </p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150942067"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A “condo” (short for condominium) is a style of housing usually located within a community of buildings owned by individuals. A “condo” community may have shared amenities like a gym, pool, garden, or adhere to rules set by an HOA. A townhouse is a style of home; generally multi-floor with shared walls with other townhouses. If a townhouse is located within a community of similar homes, it may qualify as a condominium.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a master bathroom in Pelham, New York</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In advance of moving into their newly purchased Pelham home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom in Westchester, Alexy and her husband decided to get some necessary renovations out of the way. The couple had a five-year-old and were pregnant with their second child. They were still living in Brooklyn, which made this reno project one that would be done from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house only had showers, which aren’t ideal for bathing infants. They decided to add a tub to the second-floor bathroom, which had already undergone a renovation by the previous owner that had stolen some space from the neighboring bedroom. “The bedroom closet was just a few inches deep with some shelves,” Alexy said. There was also the absence of a linen closet on the second floor. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Alexy was familiar with Sweeten from the service&#8217;s many renovations in Brooklyn, but didn&#8217;t know any general contractors in Westchester. She needed to find one she could trust since the house would be empty. They tried to get to Pelham on weekends to check on the work even though Alexy was nine months pregnant.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor they chose</a> took space from the hallway to add a large linen closet to the bathroom. &#8220;It holds a lot, and that is exactly what I wanted,” said Alexy. The redistributed hallway space also provided the extra room needed to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> to the shower area. Alexy’s husband originally wanted a double vanity, but there just wasn’t enough room. After much soul-searching, he decided what he really wanted was adequate counter space. The vanity they went with had a counter that stretched to the wall while adding more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> underneath.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The project was finished pretty much on time except for the vanity, which took a long time to be delivered, but their Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget and they encountered no surprises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How a passive house design can achieve top-notch energy efficiency</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32316 size-chrono" title="white-farmhouse-exterior" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg" alt="white farmhouse exterior with blue sloping roof after renovation" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Westport-farmhouse-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;ve heard the term &#8220;passive home&#8221; to describe a home that needs almost no help from HVAC equipment to heat or cool itself. Its temperature and comfort are adjusted via passive rather than active mechanical systems. For example, it might have large south-facing windows next to a room with a floor of dark stones that absorb the sun&#8217;s heat and retain it for hours to produce warmth in the winter, and sophisticated shading to keep the stones, and the room, cool in the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building or renovating using passive house principles can reduce energy costs by 80 to 90 percent when compared with standard buildings—saving the owners money, reducing the carbon footprint of the building, and making the house more comfortable. That&#8217;s good news!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path to reaching those savings calls for professionals with expertise in building techniques that are more exacting and often different from standard practices. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and architects, offers an overview of achieving maximum home efficiency and comfort when it comes to construction.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Certified passive house techniques</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These projects start with designs that are geared to the local climate. Sophisticated computer models are used in an attempt to get energy use down near zero. Here are elements that are common to new construction and renovation projects:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super insulation</span>: Passive houses contain much more insulation than standard houses. Where a standard well-insulated house may have R-38 in the ceiling, passive houses routinely have R-49 to 80. Walls can have R-40 or higher. (The R-value refers to the ability of insulation to resist heat flow; the higher the number, the better the insulation.) To reach those levels in a brownstone while preserving the look of the exterior, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Isaac</a> says contractors must add new framing inside the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tight construction</span>: Buildings using this technique are extremely airtight, so there is very little infiltration of outside air or loss of inside air that has been heated or cooled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High-performance windows and doors</span>: While double-glazed windows are the most common energy-efficient windows used in standard construction, triple-glazed windows with energy-efficient coatings are common here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ventilation systems</span>: Because the buildings are so airtight, mechanical ventilation is necessary to control moisture levels and maintain good air quality. The systems contain energy-recovery systems so that outgoing air can either heat or cool incoming fresh air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solar gain</span>: Windows are sized and oriented so that they can use the sun&#8217;s energy for heating in the winter. Roof overhangs help shade windows during the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, expect costs to be about 10 to 15 percent higher than standard renovation costs. Fortunately, the high-tech materials and techniques usually mean smaller heating and cooling units can be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;But passive home is about more than just energy efficiency,&#8221; said Isaac. &#8220;When you step into a passive house, it is very quiet. If you are not getting air from outside, you are not getting much sound, either. And because the air is filtered, it is very clean. It ends up being a nice way to live.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retrofitting your home</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most passive house designs are new construction, but renovations can retrofit an existing apartment or house. These types of remodels require a full-scale commitment to saving energy. Most are complete gut-to-the-exterior-walls projects to accommodate high insulation levels and other passive house techniques. EnerPhit is the certification program for retrofit renovations, and the requirements are less stringent than those for new construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32344 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kitchen-8-edit-RW-723x467.jpg" alt="passive house" width="723" height="467" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Townhouses and brownstones are good candidates,&#8221; said Sweeten contractor Isaac, who has been involved with passive renovations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. &#8220;They have these massive walls all around and there are usually other houses on either side, so there is already an advantage in controlling heating and cooling.&#8221; In addition, basements in a brownstone are so packed into the city infrastructure, little heat is lost into the ground. Focus on the roof and the short, exposed end walls of the house. Complete a home&#8217;s energy efficiency with triple-paned windows, a lot of insulation, and air sealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For individual apartments within a larger building, “you can build an airtight envelope around your unit and make it separate from the outside and the rest of the building,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. “Pack in as much insulation as you can and wrap up the apartment all the way around.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may encounter problems with building regulations if you want to make changes to the outside of the building, such as installing high-performance windows that don’t match what is already there. The same applies to buildings with landmark status. Anthony says that in theory, custom covers to hide the window frames might be a solution. This would have to be worked out with the condo or co-op board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the standalone house, all four sides of the house, the attic, and the basement need to be considered. A building—high on insulation and low on air leakage—creates a strong building envelope. All windows should be swapped out. Outfit the attic and roof with a ton of insulation which works out if the roof needs to be replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost is high in the short term but many people consider it worth it. Some homeowners do deep energy retrofits to existing houses—a big step towards passive house—but hits the sweet spot financially. A substantial amount of money will be saved on heating and cooling costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A homeowner can use just about any passive house technique because EnerPhit is a performance standard that depends on how the house performs overall, not how individual components perform. “If you can make the envelope extremely airtight, you may be able to compensate if the windows are a problem,&#8221; explained Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>The story behind passive house</strong></p>
<p>While passive building is becoming more popular, it&#8217;s not entirely new. Its concepts were used as far back as the 1980s in the U.S. The ideas were refined and honed in Germany and other parts of Europe and the movement regained momentum here in the past 15 or so years.</p>
<p>A number of international, national, and local organizations have formed—there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.nypassivehouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Passive House</a> association and the <a href="https://www.phius.org/home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passive House Institute US</a>, which conduct research, write standards, and certify architects, contractors, and other professionals. Third-party certification ensures the building will save the amount of energy predicted by the original design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When compared with the overall building and renovation industries, projects using passive house concepts make up a small percentage of the whole. But as more and more people become aware of the benefits, products and building techniques used will no doubt make their way into the standard construction practice in a bigger way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to retrofit your home to passive house standards, these Sweeten general contractors are passive house-certified and can get you on your way to living efficiently with lower costs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a renovation buff like the rest of us at Sweeten, you might be dreaming of buying (and of course, renovating) your own piece of real estate. A crucial step in turning that dream into reality? Securing a mortgage. Here&#8217;s the lowdown:</span></p>
<h3>Qualifying standards</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homebuyers are often overwhelmed by the process and the sheer volume of paperwork involved, but finding a reliable mortgage professional to walk you through the process is key. Even before you shop around for experts, however, you should have a sense of your own finances. This means knowing that you know the answers to the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a good (preferably over 700) or great credit score (typically 800 and above)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money do you have in the bank?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much monthly debt do you have compared to your monthly income?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to these questions will give you an idea of how easily you’ll be able to get the mortgage you want. The best candidates have a good credit score, money in the bank (for a healthy down payment of at least 20 percent*), a strong salary (to pay the monthly costs), and an acceptable level of debt, explained further below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage bankers work with different formulas to determine the home loan amount that you qualify for, and different lenders will use varying standards. Two of the most significant, however, are the payment-to-income ratio (“housing expense ratio”), and the debt-to-income ratio (or “debt service ratio”).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Housing Expense Ratio</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: On a conventional Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac loan, the monthly mortgage payment (including the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) cannot exceed a certain percent of your income (usually around 28 percent). So for example, if your gross income is $4,000 a month, your house payments cannot amount to more than $1,120 a month. There are exceptions: for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA-insured loans”), the percentage allowed is higher, whereas loans guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs (“VA-guaranteed loans”) do not consider the payment-to-income ratio at all but instead look at residual income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 28% = Total Housing Expenses | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 28% = $1,120]</span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Debt Service Ratio</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With a conventional home loan, your recurring debt total cannot exceed a certain percent of your monthly income (usually around 36 percent). This includes your housing payments (determined above). So continuing with the example above, if you make $4,000 a month, you are allowed a total monthly debt of $1,440. Subtracting your mortgage payment, that gives you $320 to pay all of your other recurring debts, including any student loans, credit cards, car payments, etc. As with the housing expense ratio, special loans have more forgiving percentages. On an FHA-insured loan, your debt cannot exceed 43 percent of your monthly income, whereas, on a VA-guaranteed loan, your debt cannot exceed 41 percent of your monthly stable income. </span><span class="s1">[Total Income x 36% = Total Monthly Debt Allowed | EXAMPLE: $4,000 x 36% = 1,440]</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mortgage101.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25092 mb-0 size-chrono" title="mortgage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mortgage101-723x325.jpg" alt="mortgage" width="723" height="325" /></a></p>
<h3>Getting pre-qualified or pre-approved</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive market like New York City, it’s important to start the mortgage process even before you start looking at homes. It’s generally expected that, if financing is required in your home purchase, a pre-qualification or pre-approval letter accompanies the offer. So what does it mean?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-qualification</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be considered “pre-approval-lite”—it is usually provided after you have a quick chat with your lender about your big-picture finances. They don’t do an in-depth analysis or a credit check but can give you an estimate of the amount that you’d qualify for. A pre-qualification can take as little as 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pre-approval</b></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more complex and requires you to supply the lender with documentation of your income and debt (rather than just providing it verbally, as with pre-qualification). This includes W-2s, tax returns, bank statements, paystubs, and more. (Get organized now! This information is much easier to gather if it’s not all in an unsorted pile under your bed.) It also involves an extensive check into your finances and credit. At the end, you receive a conditional commitment for the exact amount they are willing to loan you in a pre-approval letter. This letter strengthens any offer because it assures the seller that you can very likely obtain the actual funding. A pre-approval will usually take at least a whole business day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at all possible, get a pre-approval: “Most pre-qualification letters are not worth the paper they are written on, because nothing has been verified. With a pre-approval, credit, assets, and income are verified, allowing the lender to approve you for a home loan based on what you qualify for,” explains Romuald Solages, a mortgage loan officer at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.phsloans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerHouse Solutions</a>, a direct lender for mortgages to the consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span class="s1">In competitive markets, such as NYC, getting a pre-approval places you in a stronger position should you find yourself in a bidding war. It will take a little longer but it’s part of the process if you are serious about buying property with a mortgage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this means that you should speak with a mortgage broker or banker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to going to that open house (easier said than done, we know.) This process gives you an accurate estimate of how much house you can afford, based on how much you have for a down payment, as well as your financial history. Plus, once you’ve done this, you’ve drastically simplified the steps needed to take once you have an accepted offer since the lender will already have much of the information required for your application. You may need to update the info if a lot of time has passed, but you won’t be starting from scratch.</span></p>
<h3>Where to find a mortgage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to stick to your current bank for a mortgage. &#8220;Many people falsely assume that they will fare much better with their mortgage if they just use their established bank, the one they already do their banking with,&#8221; says Romuald. While many banks do advertise programs for their customers,  he adds, &#8220;it’s always best to shop around.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">There are the national lenders, like Wells Fargo and Chase, but also reputable local companies like FM Loans and Freedom Mortgage. Keep in mind you are working with specific loan officers/bankers and not just an institution, and as with attorneys and agents, many people use personal references such as friends and family. Your real estate agent should be the first place you go to for suggestions if you have no contacts. Other sources include a mortgage banker or a mortgage broker—the latter are much less common after the financial crisis. The former works directly for a lender (e.g., a bank), where your loan originates, whereas the broker is a middleman, who shops around for you and connects you to a lender.</span></p>
<h3>What if…</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have 20 percent to put down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? While that amount is recommended in today’s market, most conventional lenders will allow you to put down as little as 10 percent (unless you are applying for a special program, such as the FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed loans). With 10 percent down, however, you will still be required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which you can avoid by putting down at least 20 percent. FHA loans, which require a down payment of just 3.5 percent, are a good option for those who don’t have a lot of cash in the bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You don’t have good credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, FHA loans may be the answer here. Because the FHA insures the home loans, they lower the risk for the lender, allowing them to be more lenient with both the size of the down payment as well as the borrower’s credit score. The minimum FHA loan credit score is 580, which means that the borrower would qualify for maximum financing under their standards with a down payment of just 3.5 percent. If your credit score is lower than 580, you can still qualify, but will be required to put down 10 percent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to examine your credit reports carefully because any mistakes on your credit report could lead to a higher mortgage rate or even loan rejection. Checking your credit report with all three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—is free through annualcreditreport.com,” says Romuald. </span></p>
<h3>Buying and renovating all-in-one loan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in buying to renovate, consider applying for one loan to cover both. This simplifies the process by allowing you to do just one financing application, with only one set of closing costs. The lender will calculate how much of a mortgage you’ll qualify for based on the future value of the property, so you’ll be able to obtain a larger amount than if it was based on the current value. There is in this case also an FHA option, known as an </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/203k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FHA 203(k) loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>

<p>After living in New York City for fifteen years I&#8217;ve become a big fan of apartment living.  It&#8217;s sensible and ecologically sound.  We accumulate fewer things, leave a reduced footprint, and free up space around us for parks and plazas.</p>
<p>Yet my Dream Home has always been a wood frame house.  This might be a memory of my childhood house, a tidy split-level on a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.  And it might reflect my New England upbringing.  I love the simple, taut volumes of colonial homes, broken only by small windows and doors.  My Dream Home is a saltbox with a stubby brick chimney and a red door.  Sometimes I imagine my Dream Home beachside on a grassy field dotted wit hydrangea bushes, and sometimes I imagine it on a square lawn sheltered by maple trees and a low stone fence</p>
<p>It&#8217;s illegal to build a wood frame structure now in New York City. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/realestate/29cov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of nineteenth-century wood houses</a> were carefully maintained, have survived, and are grandfathered into the building code.  There are a few in my neighborhood and each time I pass one it conjures up the Dream Home.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1496 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This house, on East 92nd Street, is at the end of a year-long restoration.  Just the other day it received a final coat of white paint.  For many years it had seemed a bit haunted, with shuttered first floor windows, peeling blue paint, and empty planters.  The rickety wood porch and shutters sagged badly and the whole structure looked as if it were ready to collapse, as if it were being propped up by the two large brick buildings to either side.  Its owners have done a great job fixing the facade, restoring the original wood trim and siding, and adding a low stone patio in front.  I can only wonder what work they&#8217;ve done inside.</p>
<p>As an architect one of the loveliest things to see is a wood house go up.  There&#8217;s something magical about the way the frame emerges from a haze of 2&#215;4&#8217;s, and something reassuring about the way men build it so simply and quickly with hammers and nails. Maybe technological advances will give us a way to construct a wood frame that&#8217;s less vulnerable to the elements, and we can fill empty spots all over the city with small wood houses again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-669 mb-10" title="Maids Room Kitchen Wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall.jpg" alt="Maids Room Kitchen Wall" width="540" height="228" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><span class="img-label">Maid&#8217;s Room 2007, stairs down to kitchen on right.</span></p>
<p>This was what our entire house looked like when we purchased it. No, it was not finished to our standards but the bones of the house were perfect for us. It is about 2000 sq ft, three bedrooms, a large living room and kitchen, and windows on three side allowing for more light than a standard Brooklyn brownstone. The draw-back was that the last major remodel was done in 1910! That meant all new plumbing, electrical, heating and layout.</p>
<p>The layout included this &#8220;maid&#8217;s&#8221; room only accessible by stairs from the kitchen or through the bathroom. As much as I&#8217;d like a little help now and again I don&#8217;t have a cleaning person let alone a live in maid. The electrical and plumbing work had been redone by the previous owner using, what  I assume are all the skills  he learned from our local hardware store. The heating was done mostly by wood burning stove in the living room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-676 mb-10" title="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg" alt="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" width="540" height="360" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><span class="img-label">Maid&#8217;s Room 2009, same view as above.</span></p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s room, like the rest of the house, was reworked to keep the character of the house but make it livable for years to come. We closed up the stairs. Removed the back closet and wall. And punched new windows in the back wall to let more light in and a view of our back yard.  Check out the full set of photos of the process <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/swee10/sets/72157619203431217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here. </a></p>
<p>After years of working in architecture offices on other peoples houses I thought this project would be easy and enjoyable. All told this room involved six subcontractors and it was neither easy nor enjoyable, but it should have been. For all my further projects I&#8217;m using  <a href="https://swee10.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swee10.com,</a> it&#8217;s everything I wish I&#8217;d had.</p>
