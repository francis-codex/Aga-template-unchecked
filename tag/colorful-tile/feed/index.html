<h3>Setting goals for a new home</h3>
<p>We bought this house with dreams of a live/work space that would reflect our style and offer plenty of room for our art collection. Steve is a painter, so having his studio at home was a life-long dream. We also wanted a place where our friends and large extended family could come together.</p>

<p>We are Steve DeFrank and Lewis Holman. Steve teaches at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Lewis is self-employed as a tax accountant. We sold our loft condo in Williamsburg after living in it for nearly 15 years to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchase a small townhouse</a> in the South Bronx.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>From a two-family to a single-family rowhouse</h3>
<p>The engineer&#8217;s report on our 1882 rowhouse in Mott Haven, the Bronx, looked good, but we still wanted a gut renovation. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure has three stories</a> comprising roughly 1,500 square feet. The home had been divided into two apartments and had eight rooms on two of the floors. We wanted to renovate and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to a single-family home</a> to accommodate a live/work situation.</p>

<p>We listed our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/bronx-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build services in the Bronx</a>. Sweeten’s introduction to our Bronx contractor and architect was a valuable service. As first-time renovators, our biggest question before starting was how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overhauling the home would cost</a>. the project were about cost. In addition to an in-home studio, we wanted to open up every floor of the building, giving us fewer walls and more windows. We understood that altering the building in this way would be an investment.</p>
<p>The plan we made with the architect was for the ground floor to be Steve’s studio and a water closet—a bathroom with the sink outside. The middle floor would be the living and dining rooms, plus <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a customized kitchen</a> and a half bath. On the top floor would be our bedroom and a home office/guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remodeled full bath</a>, and a laundry closet.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for a true gut renovation</a>—nothing was in good enough shape to retain. Our Sweeten contractors demolished down to the bricks and joists, all of which had to be replaced or sistered; this was necessary to allow removal of the central beam, which had to be done to open up the ground- and middle-floor spaces.</p>
<h3>Radiant heat and functional stairs</h3>
<p>Throughout the home, we aimed for low-maintenance, design-worthy materials to evoke an aesthetic of warm minimalism. We wanted expansive wall space for hanging artwork. The ground-level studio interior is an open workspace with recessed LED lighting, a lot of artist’s storage, and radiant-heat flooring—which we installed on all levels. To bring as much light as possible to the studio, we opened the rear wall with an 8’ x 9’ three-panel glass sliding door.</p>
<p>We decided to remove the original front stoop and relocate the house’s entrance to the ground floor, which created some challenges. Our architect Shannon envisioned—and our Sweeten contractor produced—a storage unit that divides the entry area from the studio space. We had hoped to save the original interior staircase and railing, but our Sweeten contractor showed us options that made more sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we closed the stairs from the ground floor to the first to create more wall space in the studio; we chose a vivid pink hue for the risers, which brightens the whole entrance. On the parlor and top floors, we went with a wood stair-rail that looks simultaneously classic and modern. In the end, we were very happy that we took our contractor’s advice.</p>

<h3>Connecting all of the floors</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for the kitchen</a> included custom millwork with the front panels painted green evoking the palest verdigris. Our island, which has an angled front, is an homage to artist Donald Judd. We rented nearby during renovations and observed this living area coming together. Visiting the site at least twice a week, we loved seeing the gradual progress, sometimes glacial and sometimes lightning quick.</p>

<p>A dining-area drawer and shelving system provides storage and connects these rooms to the top floor, where the main bedroom and home office also employ coordinating storage units. We had fun with tile to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernize the full bath</a> upstairs, where we mixed matte and glossy tile in a range of sizes and colors, including chartreuse, dark green, and gray-green.</p>
<h3>A building exterior refresh</h3>
<p>The elimination of the parlor-floor entrance led to an anomaly on the front of the house, with regards to the living-room windows. The window occupying the old door frame is much larger than the window next to it. The architect’s solution—a modular window design, made up of a series of smaller frames, one of which mirrors the smaller window to create a visual connection.</p>

<h3>Steve and Lewis’ renovation advice</h3>

As first-time (and last!) renovators, we’d embarked on possibly the most stressful project of our lives. Luckily, we had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen the right team</a> carefully. Our contractor and crew kept a sense of humor during a long, arduous process.</p>
<p>Our advice to other <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners ready for a renovation</a>: Anticipate bad news and delays, and roll with the punches. Be grateful for the opportunity you have, even when you wonder why you ever thought it was a good idea! And remember, issues that arise and seem monumental during the process get solved, and are forgotten once you move in. Now when we enter our home, we feel serene.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Turn a must-do gut reno into a custom primary bath remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they bought the Spanish Revival Mediterranean in South L.A.’s Park Mesa Heights, they’d pulled off a victory: a first-time home purchase in SoCal. But Liz and Kevin’s 1923 house had a secret: water damage beneath the primary bathroom floor, thanks to a shower pan installed incorrectly a decade before. “To deal with it,” said Liz, the executive director of an education nonprofit, “we needed to take the bathroom down to the studs.” With this, Liz and Kevin started <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning for a bath remodel</a> in their L.A. home.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Liz and Kevin, a technical production senior manager, viewed the dank discovery as an opportunity “to add storage and maximize space,” Liz said. But also to showcase their style. The two Mid-Century enthusiasts, who live with daughters Omari and Naiobi, love each piece they’ve hand-picked for the 1,850-square-foot home; they wanted elements of the era in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new bathroom</a> as well. When they happened on a vintage-modern walnut dresser they liked, Liz envisioned it in a new role as a vanity. “We purchased it without knowing what the conversion would entail,” she said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding a contractor</a> who could turn it into a sink while retaining drawer space below was key to their search. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="s1">“The crew was on time, and clear about decisions they needed to be made,” Liz said. “Staying on the same page with your contractor ensures your project is executed precisely and saves you money.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>A general contractor that&#8217;s the right fit</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Liz had already received bids from two recommended contractors, she said, but neither wanted to do the dresser/vanity retrofit. “I wondered if I might have a different experience communicating with a woman contractor if only I could find one,” remembered Liz. Then she came across <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, <span class="s2">posted their project,</span> and was matched with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned contracting firm</a>. “Her bid came in lower than the others,” Liz said, “and her communication was more clear and direct.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Build an on-trend bathroom with vintage-modern flair</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a general contractor who’d take on the vanity challenge now checked off, Liz turned to other essentials. They would deal with the water stagnating under the floor. The room would also have a clean, uncluttered, and functional aesthetic. Spa-like, but not sterile. “It’s a bathroom,” she said, “not a museum!”</span></p>

<h3 class="p2">Creating a &#8220;wet room&#8221; feel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Initially, they planned for a seamless look—the same tile for the bath floor and shower floor, no curb. They’d discussed keeping the floorplan, but breaking out with a separate shower and soaking tub. The contractor suggested, however, that they move things around, repurposing the toilet alcove as a long, spacious stall comprising of a shower and tub. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They had chosen a large, vintage-feel tile which was fine for the bathroom floor but not the shower floor. </span><span class="s1">A small mosaic, instead, would allow a drainage slope, and a curb would be necessary to contain pooling water. “We struggled to get on board,” Liz said. “But once we did, it was smooth sailing.” Demolition revealed the water problem to be less serious than they’d feared. They were r</span>olling.</p>
<h3>Multiple showstopping designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dresser-turn-vanity plan proceeded. Liz found a high-rimmed, shallow trough sink that would float above the drawer space beneath. The sink’s height would also raise the low-sitting dresser up to standard vanity height. Brushed-brass faucets match the shower fixtures. Old-school, frameless medicine cabinets sit mounted on a wall of vibrant penny-round tile. (“The orange,” Liz said, “felt like a risk, but a little playful, like us.”) Milk-glass pendant lights complement the shape of the tiles. Swivel towel racks offer space to air-dry towels or clothing.</span></p>

<h3 class="p6"><span class="s1">Deliveries during a pandemic</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting pieces together proved perplexing. “This was our first renovation project and without a designer,” Liz explained. “<a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taking on that role</a> myself meant dealing with myriad decisions.” During a pandemic, it was harder. Shipping delays defied the contractor’s requirement that all finish materials be on-site before demolition could begin. “I wanted to see elements laid out before deciding,” Liz said, but plumbing or electrical couldn’t wait. By the time multiple pendants arrived for Liz to view over the tub, the electrician had already installed wiring for a previously planned recessed light. “We paid to bring him back,” Liz said.</span></p>
<h3>Communicating with your contractor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the job, the Sweeten general contractor was capable and professional. “The crew was on time, and clear about decisions they needed to be made,” Liz said, reminding renovators to also ask for the answers <i>they</i> need. “Staying on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same page with your contractor</a> ensures your project is executed precisely and saves you money.” The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reno cost $26,000</a> ($19,000 to the contractor, and $7,000 for finish materials), allowing Liz and Kevin to stay on budget. Since they’d been braced for costly water damage (and possibly mold) remediation, it felt like a fortunate break.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final result was an absolute win. “The vanity, to me,” Liz said, “is the centerpiece of the room (even though most people comment on the soaking tub!). It makes our bathroom unique and adds warmth and depth.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bonus: </b>Comparing bids can be frustrating. The couple’s brain saver: “Sweeten’s consultation phone call let me bring all my bids and talk them through with a trusted partner,” Liz said. “Sweeten helped me understand how to compare different line items, to think through what could be missing, and come up with clarifying questions to ask. Sweeten&#8217;s bid-leveling expert helped me look at payment terms and project management. This helped us feel confident about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing our contract</a>.”</span></p>
