			<h2>Let your fridge blend neatly into its surroundings with these paneling ideas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44899 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you notice in a kitchen is the refrigerator. It is big and usually holds souvenir magnets, wedding invitations, or to-do lists. With more homes featuring open-plan layouts, their size and boxy shape interfere with the visual harmony. </span>Paneling and built-ins help disguise a hidden fridge cabinet by integrating it with cabinetry. The look of the entire kitchen is unified.</p>
<p><span class="s1">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he homeowners below pulled off the ever-popular &#8220;refrigerator in cabinet&#8221; design trend with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help of their general contractors</a> from Sweeten. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A designer seeks visual harmony</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Furniture designer, Mitzie and her partner, Jenifer, chose blue and white for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a>. The entire space was simplified and unified from what it had been—outdated with a variety of closets. After laying out mood boards and careful planning, a more pleasant transition was created since it opened to the living space. While the <span class="s2">hidden fridge cabinet</span> blends in with the kitchen cabinetry, two symmetrical closets flank the main kitchen—one is a closet, and the other hides the washer and dryer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compact size with a hidden fridge cabinet</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">After renovating all of the rental units in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone they purchased</a>, Janet and Jerry kept the 600-square-foot top unit as a pied-à-terre. Scandinavian minimalism and California casualness meant the sight lines throughout the home would have few vertical disruptions. This would apply to the kitchen too. To emphasize the open and airy studio, they hid all appliances in cabinets. The washer/dryer combo, refrigerator, and pull-out freezer all fit under the countertop.</p>
<h3>A custom touch for a fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinets with waterfall island and brown cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56511" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Hampton kitchen</a>, homeowners Jennifer and Alex wanted to keep the redesign simple but inviting. They chose to add a large island for entertaining and splurged on a wine fridge and quartz countertops. To make the design more modern, they decided to install an integrated refrigerator, which streamlined the look of the cabinetry.</span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet finds a niche<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></h3>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986" title="paneled fridge nestled within a column" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="refrigerator paneling" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ainsley and Simon’s architect discovered that the column in the kitchen was merely decorative, they came up with a plan </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tuck the refrigerator inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it and add custom panels. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” Ainsley said</span><b>.</b></p>
<h3>A seamless built-in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-full" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s front door led </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly into the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She had to choose between a traditional entryway or a hybrid space that would add square footage to the kitchen. She chose the latter and added a seamless wall of cabinetry featuring a refrigerator in a cabinet, plus a pantry and a coat closet.</span></p>
<h3>A wall of closets<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in kitchen with white built ins" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48230" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/22864-Tara-Apt-01-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the flow between their living and kitchen space, Tara and Brian’s contractor came up with an idea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the refrigerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a wall already outfitted with closets. Now the refrigerator fits right in with the cabinetry, instead of jutting out in the main cooking space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46413 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Post a Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet around a structural column</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22901" title="white-long-cabinets-long-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" alt="white long cabinets with long steel handles diving white living room with open book shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey and Kumar’s apartment is full of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clever storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize their limited space. The kitchen is one such example thanks to creative built-ins. Custom cabinetry covers the refrigerator along with a neighboring pantry, while the entire unit conceals a structural column.</span></p>
<h3>A clever closet-turned-fridge idea</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scandinavian chic was the look that homeowners Roxana and Gabriel were going for in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/">Long Island City loft</a>.  They turned to a Sweeten contractor who was able to update their space to match their minimalistic style. </span><span class="s1">The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size appliance and custom cut the Ikea panels to fit.  </span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet unifies the kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal for this Manhattan couple. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took down the dividing wall</a> between the kitchen and family room and replaced it with a custom unit with storage on both sides. It was really important to the couple that they fit a fully integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator and other standard-sized appliances. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>
<h3>A puzzle of panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40347" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less like appliances, more like furniture—that was Sally’s directive for her kitchen renovation. Her contractor built out a wall of cabinets to hide <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the refrigerator</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pantry. A set of narrow units were designed to hold brooms and mops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen</a> or home remodel, discuss with your Sweeten contractor how to incorporate a seamless kitchen.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make your fridge look like a cabinet</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are several ways to make your fridge look like a cabinet. One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet–about 24 inches–which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064887893">
<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.</p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Integrated kitchen design, explained</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span>An integrated kitchen refers to a kitchen design in which components and appliances are integrated seamlessly into the overall design of the space. This type of kitchen often has a sleek and modern appearance, with clean lines and a cohesive look. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>The aim of an integrated kitchen is to create a functional and stylish space that is easy to use and maintain. </span>Sweeten looks into this system called the integrated kitchen, sometimes referred to as a concealed kitchen. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you shop, develop a plan for this specific cabinetry system. Any floor plan, from galley and L-shape to U-shape and open-concept can work. However, only certain appliance styles can be accommodated. F</span><span class="s1">loor-to-ceiling cabinetry lined up seamlessly can hide as much clutter as possible in an open-concept plan. </span></p>
<h4>Colors for an integrated kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Choose a color and material scheme that is tonal, with smooth surfaces. The different areas blend into each other or at least transition quietly to create a harmonious living space.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you do have room for a dining table, try a banquette on the wall or in a corner if it’s available. Limiting the number of chairs will enhance the minimal effect and deemphasize a &#8220;kitchen&#8221; feel.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Panels help hide appliances in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">To some extent, appliances cannot be hidden completely, but certain features make them less noticeable. Consider the refrigerator. Counter-depth versions that are “panel ready” are available from a vast range of companies, including Sub-Zero, GE, Frigidaire, and KitchenAid. Replace the enamel or stainless steel front with a panel kit from your cabinet supplier, and the fridge, which no longer juts past the countertop, will almost disappear. Note that counter-depth fridges come as side-by-sides or top- or bottom-mounts, but they won’t have quite the cubic foot capacity of the freestanding or built-in models. In fact, they may be limited by as much as 2 to 5 cubic feet and up. If you have the room, you could add a refrigerator or freezer drawer that tucks discreetly under the counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Many dishwashers can also be fitted with a matching panel, or opt for an “architectural” version like those offered by manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Miele, which have controls concealed on the inside top of the door. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Panels can’t disguise stoves, cooktops, and ovens, but you can make choices that make these indispensable appliances less prominent. Go for induction cooktops that use a smooth, single surface with the heating elements concealed underneath. Digital controls (instead of knobs) also disappear when not in use. As for the vent hood, if you have a cooktop, you can get a downdraft that sits below the counter and pops up only when in use.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Seamless kitchen cabinets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As the feature that typically takes up the most real estate in the kitchen, cabinets make or break the concealed look. European-style units open with gentle pressure applied to the outside of the door, making them a sensible choice for function and style. And hydraulic hinges on upper cabinets cause the doors to lift up and away with next to no effort. This type of sophistication comes at a price, however, so you might consider frameless doors and drawers, which completely cover the cabinet box, to suggest a seamless look. And where you can, take the cabinets up to the ceiling, to visually expand the appearance of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Before you commit, research whether matching panels are available to fit your fridge and dishwasher. Your contractor can replace the existing panels easily. If you must add hardware, choose handles molded from one piece of metal, or doors and drawers that come with built-in channels that you can grab and pull.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Add outlets to the inside of some cabinets to create small appliance garages, with sturdy hinges that can raise heavy tools like mixers up and out.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Staging a sink in an integrated kitchen</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The sink will never disappear. However, if you choose an undermount sink, it will be less noticeable. An alternative: an integrated solid surface sink and countertop—virtually seam-free! The deeper the sink, the better it hides dirty dishes, of course. Some come with a cutting board accessory that tops the sink and creates an unbroken run of the countertop. Pair the sink with a touchless faucet for fewer visible details.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Concealing electrical outlets</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you use any small appliances or electronics in the kitchen (who doesn’t?), outlets are unavoidable. Minimize their appearance by choosing outlets that match the material or wall color—like with Lutron. When that isn&#8217;t possible, try grouping switches and outlets together to diminish their overall presence. Another strategy: tuck an outlet under an overhang of a countertop, or low on a wall near the top of the counter, where it can hardly be noticed.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Minimize obvious task lighting </b></span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Probably the easiest feature to conceal, lighting nevertheless deserves a little design attention. Use cans in the ceiling for ambient light, and hide those task lights by using LED strips below your upper cabinets. Do have some fun, however, with pendants over the sink or island and a chandelier above the dining table. This is the place to introduce some wit and individual style—essential ingredients for any successful room.</span></p>
