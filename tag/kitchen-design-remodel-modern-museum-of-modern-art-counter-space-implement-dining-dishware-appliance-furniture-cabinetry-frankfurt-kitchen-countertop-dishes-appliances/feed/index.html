<p><a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a>&#8216;s new kitchen design exhibit &#8220;<a title="&quot;Counter Space&quot;" href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/legacy_redirect/exhibitions/1062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counter Space</a>&#8221; puts dozens of everyday kitchen accessories and furnishings on display.  Some are entirely familiar (a soy sauce bottle, Tupperware tumblers, a brown paper bag), and seeing them sitting inside vitrines makes one appreciate how lovely they are.  Other, more unusual objects (a cork-covered serving bowl, a glass-handled frying pan, a jet-pack vacuum cleaner) make one realize how Darwinian product design is, and how only the most cost-effective and useful things survive.</p>
<p>The highlight of the exhibit, installed at the center of the gallery, is a Frankfurt Kitchen from 1926-27, one of the thousands of units mass-produced and installed in public housing projects in Germany after World War I.  It&#8217;s layout is designed to minimize the distances moved between the sink, stove, countertop and table when preparing meals.  It&#8217;s a sweet little room with built-in cutting and ironing boards, and compartments for grains, spices, cooked foods, and garbage.</p>
<p>But the real power of the exhibit is the way it stirs up memories.  One can walk through and identify items from her grandmother&#8217;s kitchen, her childhood home, and her first apartment.  And one can recall with regret all the lovely dishes and appliances of her own that she&#8217;s broken, lost, given away, or sold.  Although our kitchen things are designed for efficiency and ease, we love them dearly.</p>
