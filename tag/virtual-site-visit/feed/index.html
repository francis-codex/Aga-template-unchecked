<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is a virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit, simply, is a site visit conducted over video. It lets you safely review renovation projects while maintaining social distance with homeowners. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit helps you achieve two primary objectives:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Appraise site conditions and the project scope, so you can prepare a working estimate for the project.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Sell your firm’s qualifications. This means building rapport with the client, sharing your proposed ideas for the renovation, and highlighting your firm’s strengths and experience..<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">The two types of virtual site visit</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: this is most common, and makes sense if the client already lives in the space being renovated. They’ll be onsite, and will walk you though the space by video.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: this works if the client hasn’t yet moved into the space. You can go to the site and see it in person, while the client watches on video and directs you.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to prepare:</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s important to make a good first impression. Review the project information that’s been shared with you. Prepare questions for the clients about their project vision and what they’re looking for in a general contractor. This will help the conversation flow. Remember that this could be their first renovation; they won’t necessarily know all the questions that need addressing. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Video Technology</b></span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Confirm with the client that they can get a strong enough signal at the job site.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Agree on a backup plan, in case your video quality breaks down during the call. Will you move to a regular phone call? Or, if you think you can resolve the connection problems, will you reschedule a video call?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p6"><strong><span class="s1">The Sweeten Video tool:</span></strong></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">Sweeten&#8217;s in-platform video tool for virtual site visits makes it easy and organized to work with a potential client. It will run on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. No outside video apps or other downloads will be necessary. Save time on dealing with Android/iPhone compatibility issues. </span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">All parties will receive a link to the video meeting in an email.</span><span class="s4"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Your Sweeten account manager can give you a quick tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> If you use a third-party video app:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">You and the client must agree in advance on which video chat app to use.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Many clients favor Zoom or Facetime. If one or both parties use an Android device, you won’t be able to use Facetime.</span><span class="s6"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul3">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Zoom is free, but limits the calls to 40 minutes, unless you have a commercial account, and you host the call.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Download any necessary software ahead of time, and try using it with a colleague, friend, or family member beforehand. Familiarize yourself with the software’s functions and quirks.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Questions</b></span></h5>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">These should include:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">How quickly is the client looking to start the remodel?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What qualities or services are most important to the client in a contractor?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Will an architect, designer, or the homeowner be choosing the materials? Remind the homeowner that ordering and delivery of materials to arrive on time is critical for preventing delays.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Is the client planning to live in the space during the renovation?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What constraints are there on site access, work hours, parking, etc.?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The actual visit</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Successful virtual site visits usually have three parts: introduction, walkthrough, and discussion.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This your opportunity for a casual hello—a stand-in for a handshake. Let the client know you’re excited about the project. Share a little bit about yourself and your renovation experience. Agree on a backup plan, if there are video problems.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Virtual Renovation Site Walkthrough</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: the client will be on-site, while you watch on video remotely. Ask the client to show you the spaces that they’re planning to renovate. Have them walk through with the camera pointed away from them. As they move through the space, speak clearly; politely ask them to slow down, back up, turn left or right, point up or down. Take screenshots, or ask the clients to send photos of specific features in a followup email, if you think it will be helpful. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: you’ll visit the job site, while the client watches remotely. You can accomplish the same social distancing, with the added benefit that you can see the site firsthand and make actual measurements. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">With this method, some of the roles are reversed. You’ll be walking through the site, pointing your phone’s camera, while the client guides you from afar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is your time to shine, so talk up your experience! Offer to send examples of similar projects you have completed, so the client can see evidence of your abilities. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Spend plenty of time addressing the client’s concerns. Ask them to review the project with you. Ask all the questions necessary to ascertain the project scope. Cover all the other questions you’ve prepared. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Finally, be clear about your plans to follow up. Tell the client when they can expect to see your bid. Encourage them to follow up with any questions, and tell them the best channels for reaching you.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Followup, Estimate, Ongoing Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit will usually give you enough information to draw up a “best effort” estimate. If you need more information, contact the client as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Be sure to manage expectations. Make it clear that this initial estimate should be considered “commercially reasonable,” but may need to be updated once you’ve made in-person measurements or seen inside the walls. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">And be sure to stay in touch. This will be a new experience for most clients—probably an expensive, disruptive, and scary one. The best way to put them at ease is with clear communication. Ask them their preferred channels for updates, and make sure they always know what’s going on and what to expect.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How does a virtual site visit compare with a physical site visit?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re able to conduct a “contractor in the space” visit, to an uninhabited site, It should be just as effective. Communication is a bit more cumbersome, but you can see everything you need to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a “client in the space” visit, where you survey the site by video, you should be able to gather enough information to make an initial estimate. According to Long Island-based </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6806#overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor Robi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I truly believe a virtual site meeting for most projects will be enough to send an estimate for the labor cost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one item that is held up is the material selection process.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re a design-build firm and are assisting with design and materials</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “then even the design process can be done virtually in order to get the price of material selections.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
