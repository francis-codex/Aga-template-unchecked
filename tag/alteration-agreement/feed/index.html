<p>Chances are, if you’re renovating in an apartment building—whether it’s a co-op or a condo—you’ll know what an NYC alteration agreement is. And if you don’t, read on! It’s one of the many factors that will determine whether your renovation vision can come to life.</p>
<p>Alteration agreements recognize the reality of urban living: your neighbors are just a wall, ceiling, or floor away. What you choose to do in your renovation will affect their apartments and their lives over the duration of your project. This document prioritizes the greater good of the building over your desire for a new kitchen configuration. However, it doesn’t mean that you can’t get that new layout. The document is there to give consideration to your fellow residents. We offer this outline as the jumping-off point for your renovation’s building approval process.</p>
<h3>What is usually included in an alteration agreement?</h3>
<h4>Scope of work</h4>
<p>The document will request a scope of work from your architect or general contractor. This, along with submitted plans, will be reviewed by the board and its architect. They may have questions for you. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors in NYC are <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experts in managing this board approval process</a>.</p>
<h4>Insurance</h4>
<p>The agreement will ask you to provide the proper paperwork from your contractor and any subcontractors working on the project. Pay attention to the level of insurance required. In New York City, buildings typically require $1 to $2 million of coverage. Some buildings, however, require upwards of $5 million. Sweeten architect Jiwoo points out, “If your building requires this level of insurance, the pool of general contractors available to you automatically shrinks. Most contractors do not carry this level of insurance, so you’re really looking for experts who specialize in luxury buildings.”</p>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<p>Boards like to maintain the quality of life for other building residents over the course of your remodel. One way is by restricting the hours of the day that a renovation is permitted. Usually, there cannot be loud noises prior to 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m. Sometimes the work is reserved for only certain months of the year. For example, Jiwoo tells us that in some apartments on Central Park West, homeowners are only permitted to do renovation work in the summers.</p>
<p>Alteration agreements may include information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how long your project</a> can take. If the deadline is exceeded, sometimes a penalty fee is imposed. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor Santiago</a> shares that while many alteration agreements include this penalty, boards are often willing to extend the date or to provide a grace period.</p>
<p>Other agreements may dictate that only a certain number of renovations can be ongoing at any given time. As a result, you may have to plan your date and wait for your neighbors to complete their projects before you can begin yours.</p>
<h4>Wet-over-dry rule</h4>
<p>This is another key element to look for in an alteration agreement. If you&#8217;re planning to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move your bathroom</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand your kitchen</a> into spaces previously designated as bedrooms or living rooms, you may run into challenges. Buildings often want to keep all the “wet” rooms in a vertical stack due to the possibility of leaks. However, your architect can work with the board to explain how precautions will be taken to limit the possibility of leaks or noise from these rooms that might be disruptive to neighbors.</p>
<h3>Is it worth submitting plans that request something that is expressly prohibited in the alteration agreement?</h3>
<p>The document provides the ground rules for your renovation. That said, it depends on the character of your board and the management company. Open a discussion on a reasonable point if you think that the agreement is outdated or does not reflect current practice. Examples could be the enforcement of the wet-over-dry rule or the prohibiting of a new HVAC system. The first person to ask is the property manager—if that person says no, it’s not worth wasting your time.</p>
<p>The building board of one <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner on the Upper West Side</a> prohibited central air from being installed. With tenacity and support from her renovation team, she was the first homeowner to have the HVAC system in her home.</p>
<h3>What if there is no alteration agreement?</h3>
<p>If your building does not have an alteration agreement, it does not mean that you are free to take a no-holds-barred approach to your renovation. This means that the approvals process will be dictated entirely by the composition of the board and its preferences. Smaller buildings might not have this document and these approvals processes tend to be very hands-on. This scenario may play out in the renovator’s favor, however, given that these small buildings can also be more open to your vision.</p>
<h3>Important things to remember</h3>
<p>Sweeten contractor Santiago reminds us of the purpose of alteration agreements: “The main thing is that the board wants to protect itself. Second, it wants to protect the other shareholders.”</p>
<p>But you should take the document with a grain of salt. “It only gives you so much insight. It’s a formal document, but the truth of the matter is only revealed when you jump into the process,” explains Sweeten architect Jiwoo. “Ultimately, the alteration agreement tells you very little about what the review process is like. It’s not until you get comments back from your board’s engineer or architect that you will really discover what is off-limits and what is permitted.”</p>
<p>Use your alteration agreement as a guide, but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with an experienced NYC general contractor</a> and architect to help you navigate both the agreement and the co-op board. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the remodeling experts</a> with the right experience and you&#8217;ll be on your way to demolition and a reimagined space.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Welcome to #9 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p><em>Feel free to email me at <strong><a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a></strong> with any reno questions or dilemmas you&#8217;d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What is an alteration agreement?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>If you live in a co-op or condo building in New York City, you&#8217;ll have an alteration agreement. In the document, your board lays out all of the rules and guidelines for renovating in your building to ensure there is minimum disruption to your neighbors while a renovation is in progress. This can include rules on the allowable work hours (to limit noise) and when the freight elevator will be open for deliveries or materials. When you&#8217;re buying, or if you&#8217;re thinking about renovating in a co-op or condo, you should read your alteration agreement immediately before talking to a general contractor; you&#8217;ll need to share those guidelines right from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another important piece of information usually found in the agreement is how much insurance your building requires. This amount is usually from $1 million to $3 million, which you&#8217;ll want to relay to any contractors you&#8217;re speaking with in order to make sure that they have that coverage in place before they even step foot inside your home. If you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project on Sweeten</a> and include this amount in your profile, Sweeten will make sure to only match you to contractors who can cover the requirement.</p>

			<h2>Make it easier for a co-op board to approve your home renovation with a few key steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22518 size-chrono" title="co-op boards" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01_300-Riverside_3-723x481.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="481" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op buildings have unique ownership structures. C-op owners technically lease the space an apartment occupies. A co-op board, and its representative, the management company, have power over any renovations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’d like to do. Because the board’s role is to protect the interests of all of the owners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the process is less in your control than you&#8217;d think. However, by following a few key practices, you can put your co-op board at ease for your desired remodel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Simple renovations may not need co-op board approval</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most basic work done in kitchens and bathrooms is known as “rip and replace.” This work includes updating finishes, replacing porcelain plumbing fixtures, and upgrading appliances in their existing locations. For this, your building may not demand a permit; saving you money, time, and general red tape.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How your building will evaluate your plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your building is likely to use its own architect to evaluate any renovation plans you submit. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his process is known as an alteration review.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Expect to pay for this service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, typically in the $1,000-$2,000 range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The architect may flag aspects of the design which seem only tangentially related to your renovation objectives </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e.g., relocating the intercom). As a result,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communications can drag on for months. However, the principal concerns of this review will not be aesthetic. Rather, the building architect is charged with protecting the building from liability, plus advising the board about building code requirements. Overall dimensions of rooms, and door openings, may need to be enlarged as part of gut renovations. In other cases, wet areas, like bathrooms and kitchens, may be required to stay within the pre-renovation footprint. This requirement is also known as “wet over wet.” These rules act to protect a downstairs neighbor from flooding after a bathroom upstairs is enlarged over, say, a bed. Also remember that with new plumbing, the building may also require you to replace branch lines all the way back to the main water lines. This may result in additional demolition and expenses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bring in your own architect</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For larger jobs, you’ll need your own architect or engineer. Some offer advice on style and design at a premium price. Others will produce a basic set of drawings that can be submitted to the co-op board or management. They may also file renovation plans with the city, in a service known as “architect of record” and “expediter.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Larger renovations requiring a city permit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permit for a larger co-op renovation can sometimes be a judgment call. In extreme cases, your board may decide to make you file for one after work has begun. (Be aware: this can possibly result in fines and other city penalties!) The city will also require you to produce a certificate documenting asbestos tests for areas of the apartment that will be demolished. Asbestos can be found in many places: in plaster or joint compound, in caulking, in linoleum flooring, or even impregnated in the underlayment for wood floors. Should asbestos be present, you will be asked to plan for removal by specialists, or encapsulation. The latter is usually cheaper, leaving asbestos undisturbed and adding new finishes on top, when space and aesthetic considerations allow this.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Legal considerations &amp; co-op rules</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op board or building likely has already published and distributed alteration terms or as “house rules,” which should be reviewed closely. They often cover things like requirements for working hours, deliveries, and protections mandated for common areas during debris removal. Even in jobs that do not require permits, you will want to provide management with a written scope of work, listing the various upgrades you propose and requesting written permission—at least over email—to proceed.</span></p>
<h3>What is an alternation agreement?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit your plans,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-op board may ask you to sign an “alteration agreement.” This alteration agreement can include provisions tailored to your particular job. It is not uncommon, especially in blue-chip buildings, for these agreements to encompass punitive regulations. Provisions like time limits for renovations, and daily penalties imposed when jobs are not completed as requested by the co-op board, are not uncommon. These agreements may also<span>—not surprisingly—</span>seek to shift liability for construction to the apartment owner. In cases of particularly punitive agreements, however, you may choose to engage a tenant’s lawyer to negotiate more favorable terms with the building’s legal representative. Typically, you will need to acknowledge the agreement in exchange for the co-op board’s or management company’s signature on your building permit application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding problems in a co-op renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proprietary lease may allow inspections, so the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building architect or superintendent may ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a look around your apartment, should any questions arise about your proposed renovations or even work underway. For this reason, it is worth keeping the apartment clean and tidy, whether you are living there through the renovation, or not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An environmental testing firm may visit the apartment to monitor lead levels as part of a regular inspection. (This is most likely if your building has a history of lead.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don&#8217;t panic—especially if you have an advance warning. State environmental agencies recommend cleaning with a HEPA vacuum for soft surfaces, or soapy water and paper towels for hard surfaces.</span></p>
<h3>Managing relationships with your co-op board</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in the good graces of your co-op board, and particularly becoming friendly with the board president, can short-circuit potential miscommunications and suspicions based on building gossip. The co-op board has the ultimate discretion to direct the building management in matters regarding the schedule and procedures around your renovation. And if you are hoping any exceptions will be made, neighborliness—to say nothing of cookies or Champagne—may help. Good luck navigating the co-op board to fulfill your renovation dreams!</span></p>
