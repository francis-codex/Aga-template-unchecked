<p><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowner Rachel</em></p>
<h5>A Manhattan duplex remodel (instead of moving)</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our first home, which we bought about six years ago just after we got married. When we were planning to expand our family, we knew we had to renovate or move. There was enough square footage, but we needed more distinct rooms or spaces. The apartment is a duplex co-op in Greenwich Village which was built in 1910. We love Greenwich Village so much and I really wanted to have the experience of raising a baby here. So, we renovated!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living here for so long before the renovation was really helpful since it gave us plenty of time to think about the best possible use of the space. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath, but wanted another bedroom for a baby. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old layout didn&#8217;t really work for entertaining</a>, either—the kitchen and dining room were upstairs while the living room was downstairs. Marco and I also wanted our own personal spaces within our home for his hobbies and for my closet/office. Overall, we hoped to create a comfortable family home that met everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always thought of our apartment as a hidden gem—a colorful, fun place where you could see a little girl growing up, sophisticated yet flexible enough to allow for events like playdates and parties. The general contractors we found through Sweeten were really amazing. On top of being creative problem solvers, they were incredibly nice guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The top floor would be a combined kitchen/dining/living area, so the kitchen needed to be functional but also beautiful enough for a dinner party. We hid most of the appliances behind paneled cabinets; an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; and snack storage were organized inside hallway cabinets outfitted with marble countertops. When we have family-style dinners, we set up the self-serve dishes and bar in those spaces. So, yes, you&#8217;re in a kitchen, but it&#8217;s also an elegant dining room.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>Customizing the almost-black kitchen</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cook a lot and was so excited for the stove. I wanted one of those fancy French stoves that come in custom colors, but they are so expensive! Instead, I found one from a U.S. manufacturer for maybe one-third the price. (They also do custom colors.) The cabinet color was chosen to match the stove, so this appliance is &#8220;hidden,&#8221; too. We wanted something different from the typical all-white kitchen that would also complement the light wood floors. This almost-black shade is just a little more interesting than plain black. It took lots of trips to the paint store for swatches!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We put a lot of thought into maximizing space and brainstorming with our Sweeten contractors. We really pushed them to be creative. I just kept saying, &#8220;We need to hide the trash and we need a spice cabinet. Where can we do it?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t let up! The answer was wrapping the cabinets around the pillar and also where the lower cabinets end, which created a finished look. There were other details: I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with big molding</a>. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with big molding. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few challenges, like the flooring. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, including completely refinishing the downstairs floors more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the fireplace, which was very old and didn&#8217;t work. Our contractors figured out it was a faux fireplace that took up space for no reason, so it was removed.</p>
<h5>Matching new and old brick</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also needed to make our brand-new brick match with the brick from 1910. Our contractors came up with a solution that was even better than what we had imagined. We repaired some portions, which was very expensive, and painted the wall solid white, stripping that paint off layer by layer to create the current washed effect. That helped to blend the new and (very) old brick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom needed updating, too. It was really old with a weirdly-shaped, very deep, mini tub. We installed a beautiful regular-sized tub and shower tile I had seen in another project our contractors had done, which I loved. I pushed hard to put in a double-wide mirror, even though there were a lot of issues with making a recessed cabinet fit the space. I&#8217;m glad I persevered because it makes the room so much bigger.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>A bedroom transforms into personal hobby spaces</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marco and I have always believed in having our own spaces. We divided what used to be a huge bedroom into two separate spaces to create his office and my closet. Marco needed his own space where he could work on his hobbies without driving me crazy! He likes to do things that create dust and noise and play his music really loud. He works hard during the week, so he should have a place to do that! The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office is actually soundproofed</a> so he won&#8217;t wake the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32176 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-couch-blue-wall-painting" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg" alt="blue couch and blue painting on wall and brick wall with metal open shelf" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Sweeten was great; they continually checked in with us. I knew I could go to them if there was ever an issue with our contractor. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you need to pick finishes in person whenever possible. It&#8217;s really hard to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like on a computer screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The decorative trim of crown molding adds timeless character and visual appeal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43509 size-full" title="baseboard, crown, mantelpiece molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Molding and picture frame molding by</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;list&quot;,{},&quot;list_item&quot;,{&quot;indent&quot;:1,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numbered&quot;}]"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-25575 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">p<span class="s1">anel molding, painted a deep teal blue, gives their dining room personality.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also consider UL-Listed hollow crown molding that can hide common household wiring, good for a home office.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="dining room remodeled" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42955 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg" alt="Staircase remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>While renovating their Brooklyn brownstone, Nazli and Larry discovered the merits of a dark, painted pantry and that heated floors were indeed worth fighting for</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<h3>Remodeling a brownstone for the future</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My wife B and I loved our little one-bedroom duplex in Hell’s Kitchen, but it had two drawbacks. It was small and the spiral staircase was a safety hazard we suspected would only worsen as we got older. Our budget was tight for the two-bed, two-bath apartment we wanted, but we felt it was time to make the move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on Park Slope, we were outbid on two apartments: one that wasn&#8217;t perfect and another with a cute balcony. It became clear that we needed to look at apartments below our budget so we could bid higher, but there wasn’t much in that range.</p>

<h3>Finding a solution in a fixer-upper home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I expanded my search to include places with only one bathroom, and saw an apartment pop up that fit our budget—the listing said, “Bring your contractor.” It was a big mess, but at least it was big! I rushed to an early open house on a Wednesday morning so I could be one of the first to see it. As I left, I texted B, “It needs a lot of work, but it just feels like home.” She came back with me that Sunday and was equally smitten with the place. We had to outbid 11 other offers, but this time, we got it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg" alt="Living area with window nook alcove and open door to the office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52131 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-bed, one-bath (now two-bath) co-op is on the 2nd floor of a brownstone building in the center of Park Slope. The bathroom was in desperate need of an update, and the kitchen was more or less non-existent (there were a few cabinets and a sink). We didn’t know if we needed an architect, a contractor, a designer, or all of the above. After speaking to a few of each, none thought they could complete the work we needed in the range of our budget. That&#8217;s when we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten to find a contractor who had the experience to take on the work. We were matched with a few and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Opting for a full-home remodel in Brooklyn</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to take the plunge and do a full-home remodel on the Park Slope brownstone apartment, including installing new 5&#8243;-wide oak floors in a cherry stain, replacing crumbling plaster walls with drywall, and adding a washer/dryer in the hallway closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg" alt="Office with black desk, book shelves, and large window" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52132 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg" alt="Living room with gray couch, gray walls, and a blue wall niche" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52130 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the sense of history in the home and wanted to save as many of the original features as possible. Some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">molding was salvaged</a> and matched as closely as possible. The majority of the tin ceiling was saved along with the exposed brick walls and the Deco-style fireplace in our living room. The fireplace has a fresh coat of paint. Sadly, we weren’t able to save the beautiful French doors, but one now hangs horizontally on the living room wall as a piece of art.</p>

<h3>Making the space personal</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond matching the existing style, we wanted an apartment that felt cozy and creative. For me, as a writer, that meant lots of space for books. The existing small study, where one of the two doorways was removed and a transom was added, was the perfect spot for our collection. In addition, the writer in me also loved the bay window. I envisioned a banquette underneath for writing and lounging and storage as an added bonus. <span style="color: #333333;">Sitting curled up on that bench with a book is now one of my favorite activities. (Editor&#8217;s note: the owners added the banquette </span>after the photoshoot.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-52126 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="View of the open plan kitchen with counter space and seating, and adjacent hallway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen with stainless steel appliances and gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52127 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was probably the biggest transformation. The only appliance in the kitchen was a small, cheap stove that the sellers brought in for the inspection, a small sink, and a few metal cabinets. Luckily, that area needed very little demo! <span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor gave us a 3D rendering of our wishlist—a large peninsula for bar stools, ample storage space including deep drawers for our pots and pans, and the triangular configuration for our stove, sink, and fridge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="Kitchen counter with white marble countertops and white tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52129 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Open plan kitchen with white counters and backsplash and gray cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52128 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Finding the right accents and patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We tried to bring in our “cozy and creative” feel through the fixtures and furniture. Our contractor sourced most of our materials⁠, besides the lighting and appliances. As a result, this gave us more time to focus on finding the right accent pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_AimeeWalker_Apt04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05.jpg" alt="Bedroom with colorful sham on the bed" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52117 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-52118 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-06.jpg" alt="Bedroom with colorful sham on the bed and a bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-19.jpg" alt="Bathroom with glass shower door and open storage shelving" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bathroom-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor helped us to figure out the best layout in the apartment. Since we were planning to put in a second bathroom, we wanted to create an ensuite master bedroom. Consequently, we removed a wall between the two rear bedrooms so the master would be next to the large walk-in closet. That closet became the master bath. As a result, we were able to build a new clothes closet. This also enabled us to annex some hallway space.</p>

<h3>Rolling with the remodel process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we love the end result of our new home in Brooklyn, the full home renovation process <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took a lot longer</a> than we had originally hoped. This was partly due to waiting for city permits, changes to our original plan, and the general busy schedule of our contractor. We were able to stay in our old apartment for some time because we had low carrying costs, and held off selling it as long as possible. When we finally put our old place on the market, it sold quickly and we moved into the new place with only a few weeks&#8217; notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg" alt="Light blue bedroom with a striped bed sham and Florida poster" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52119 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor&#8217;s team got it to a “move-in ready” state in time for our move, but we realized that our idea of move-in ready differed from theirs. The floors were dry enough to put our furniture down, but none of the kitchen appliances worked. We had one functioning toilet with the only working sink in the kitchen. B and I had an interesting experience making ramen with our coffee maker and eating tuna out of a pouch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, that rough patch just made us appreciate our wonderful new kitchen and the whole apartment even more. And we still love all the little details that make this apartment uniquely ours.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Aimee and B, for sharing your cozy Park Slope brownstone remodel with us! </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 2017, Brooke and Paul closed on a 1924 Mediterranean-style home in Pelham, New York. The couple, already living in town, was drawn to the location of the house, perched on a picturesque hillside cul-de-sac in a neighborhood full of young families like their own. The property was designed by architect Guy Mariner, who arrived in Pelham in the early 20th century, making his mark on the suburb&#8217;s historic residential homes and landmarked structures. Their &#8220;new&#8221; old home featured exposed oak beams, beautiful archways, and a barrel-tiled roof—not to mention original faience tiles and leaded-glass windows. The space was almost perfect for them, their kids—Charlotte, Francie, and Teddy—and their two black Labs, Hattie and Reed. There were a few changes that needed to be made to accommodate their busy daily routine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Their previous home had an expansive, open kitchen with a large island that encouraged casual family gatherings, and it was the go-to spot for baking, art and crafts, and Play-Doh sculptures. In this new house, the kitchen was closed off from the dining room and had lower ceilings. The cabinetry was warped, and the island was “too small for our family of five to gather around,” Brooke explains. The design choices in the kitchen did not match the rest of the house, and the duo wished for an aesthetic befitting the historic architecture of the home while addressing the practical and busy lifestyle of an active family. &#8220;We wanted to create a kitchen that would be functional for everyone to be in without feeling crowded,&#8221; she said. Additionally, the master bath needed a major facelift: a pedestal sink provided no storage and the ancient tub had to go. The pair <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. They were quickly matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>, who they asked to design and install the kitchen, along with a new vanity in the master bath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooke and Paul embarked on the renovation process without having first lived in the home, which presented some challenges. They weren’t sure how they would use the space, but they did know that they wanted adequate storage, a more open kitchen/dining area, and a large island. Their Sweeten contractor took this information and came up with a solution that incorporated their wishlist. First, they took down the wall separating the dining room and the kitchen and added a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large island</a> in its place. “It was also very important to me to have an island that curved out so that when we gathered around to eat, we weren’t in a straight line,” says Brooke.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/kitchen-renovation-cost-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32996 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-1-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County kitchen renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the age of the house, the ceiling in the kitchen was quite low and not level. They would have lost two inches if they attempted to level the entire surface. The solution: their contractor carefully integrated the cabinets within the out-of-level areas and cut the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moldings</a> in a certain way to give the appearance of an even ceiling. Brooke tells us, “I struggled with designing a kitchen that I hadn’t lived in before, but our Sweeten contractor was great to work with; he blended my suggestions into his designs and I’m thrilled with how it turned out.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt10.gif" alt="renovator Westchester" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple also chose to install a microwave drawer (a favorite), an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extra-large fridge</a>, and two refrigerator drawers just for beverages. Brooke reports that she loves her blue patterned tile backsplash, a splurge that really embraces the Mediterranean architecture of the home. She went with marble for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>; after examining other options, she couldn’t find a substitute that would give the feel she was looking for. A soft gray paint complemented the white cabinetry and blue island. The configuration of the new kitchen, which not only combined the dining room but also opened up the existing butler’s pantry, created a better flow and an easier space for the family to congregate. A custom L-shaped dining bench, topped with cheerful blue and yellow pillows, was the final touch to a warm, happy space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bath, their Sweeten contractor was tasked with <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a vanity</a> that could hold a laundry hamper as well as toiletries and other daily necessities. He worked with the small footprint, since moving the plumbing fixtures would have meant going over budget. In the end, however, Brooke and Paul took about a foot from an adjacent bedroom to fashion a slightly larger space. The new vanity is topped with marble and utilizes all the space available. A walk-in shower with pebbled tile floors replaced the old tub, and a bold custom blue paint was the final touch for a fresh new space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, Brooke shares one of her major lessons learned: Paint colors never look the way you expect them to. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32997 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Westchester County renovation costs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GenPost-Embeds-Reno-Westchester-2-723x143.jpg" alt="Westchester County renovation costs" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marrying an old house with modern life also meant taking time to figure out how the family wanted to live and use the space. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t been in our home for six months yet, so there&#8217;s still movement in how and where I store things as we get settled,&#8221; explains Brooke. During the demolition, they discovered a time capsule buried by previous owners containing a newspaper clipping dating from the first day of the Iraq War, as well as some information about the family and neighbors. And now, their own house history begins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Diving into a multi-story Brooklyn brownstone renovation, welcoming spaces like the foyer, guest bedroom, and bath get the luxe treatment for friends and family</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home. Read on for Nazli’s take on their plans for the new townhouse, and the full reveal of their guest suite on the second floor. Fittingly, for a family that loves to host, it was the first room finished and ready for occupancy!</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>
