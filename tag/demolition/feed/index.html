										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello again from Crown Heights! We were treated to a summer tour of Colin and Orli&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/colin-and-orlis-sweetened-crown-heights-work-studio-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super creative work studio</a> and we&#8217;re back this week for a full look at the new bathroom, kitchen, and living room in their two bedroom co-op. This scenic and costume designer pair is no stranger to creating transporting spaces and pieces for the theater, but they needed heavy duty help to deal with five layers of rotting floor tiles in the bathroom and fire damage hidden behind the kitchen walls. We dispatched a Sweeten expert for huge overhauls in both rooms and for custom replica and restoration work throughout the apartment, and we were so intrigued by the possibilities in this unique space that we took identical sets of before, during, and after photos that reveal how much work went into re-creating this home. Read on through for the full story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="diningroom-hardwood-floors-kitchen-with-walnut-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47788 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg" alt="photo of dining room with hardwood floors and crown molding and trims and another photo of kitchen with black granite countertop and walnut cabinets and tile floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14162"></span>Colin and Orli knew they had a major project on their hands before closing on the place. The most significant demolition was needed in the bathroom, which had accumulated five different layers of floor tiles, all glued down over each other through multiple renovation attempts spanning decades. The extra floor heft was especially obvious when you stepped down into the tub &#8211; the unexpected drop was enough to catch a visitor off guard. Water damage and rotting materials extended throughout the room and down through the floorboards and joists. Pedro&#8217;s team needed to replace some of the studs, level the joists, and work through plumbing all the way back to the building&#8217;s stacks. In the kitchen, the couple intended to keep the general footprint, but uncovered fire damage from a previous tenant inside the walls. Studs with char marks, several layers of cracked flooring, and non-level sub-flooring required structural work before the fun fixtures and appliances could come anywhere near the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="dark-green-square-bathroom-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47793 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg" alt="bathroom with dark green square wall tiles and walk in shower with glass dors and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orili-Bathroom-After-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Colin and Orli came up big with two distinctive tile choices in the bathroom. They headed straight for the unfailingly classic and vintage appeal of black and white hex tiles, and picked up a case of each at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/Bathroom_Tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. The path to new wall tile was not quite as direct &#8211; the couple admittedly agonized over finding the right color &#8211; something that would be saturated and bright, luminous and with a hand-painted feel. With a Starbucks-green glaze in mind, they found exactly what they wanted in a ceramic tile at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/ceramic/mcintones_ceramics/ceramic_tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a>. Complete Tile also nailed all of the possible tile configurations, allowing Pedro and his team to work with rounded bullnose, chair rail, and corner tiles all in the same coordinating hues. To save the bathroom from future water damage, they picked up a new tub and fully enclosed it with tile and a sliding glass door. Pedro installed a <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/inspiration-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville</a> vanity topped with granite from <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> and fixtures from <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faucet Direct</a>, where they also found their new eco-flush toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Colin and Orli selected ceramic floor tiles that mimic a slate feel with organic color variation (many tiles in this style have texture or color variation that is digitally printed on top, but not these). They ordered <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville cabinetry</a> from Home Depot in a whiskey black finish, which gives the kitchen a weathered, craftsman feel. They found the cabinet hardware on <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build.com</a>, whose order and return policy made it easy to directly compare more than a dozen finishes. The new countertop has become a deeply loved piece &#8211; at the <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> shop, it was covered in a layer of dust and didn&#8217;t reveal it&#8217;s rich blue, green, and black translucent depth until it arrived for installation. All the appliances are from <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Madison</a>: the stove is a <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Kitchen-Appliances/Ranges/Gas-Range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fridgidaire</a> 5-burner, the fridge is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> with french doors which leave just enough room to swing open in the galley, and the modern sink faucet is <a href="https://www.moen.com/kitchen/sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>. To finish the look, Colin and Orli wrapped the room in an antique silver gloss tin backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.americantinceilings.com/shop-backsplashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tin Ceiling Company</a>. They managed the faux finish on the walls themselves using a basic rag roll glazing technique (but substituting lace for the rag) and finishing things off with a soft blending brush, using a similar technique that was used in the living room.  The barn light above the dining area is from <a href="https://www.barnlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barn Light Electric</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Pedro sanded and finished the floors to preserve the original wood and inlay border with a high gloss luster. To conceal the steam heat pipe in the living room corner, Pedro boxed out the section and added a decorative grill from <a href="https://aagrilles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Architectural Grills</a>. While the work in the living room was largely cosmetic, Colin and Orli are grateful to Pedro for his painstaking replicas of much of the building&#8217;s original details. Pedro custom-built the floating shelves to carry the same ornate lines of the picture rail molding. He was also able to largely match the trim molding that had previously existed with support from Dyke&#8217;s Lumber. However, since the door and window casements were not available off the rack, he went the extra mile and personally cut hundreds of feet of trim material to match the original art deco detail Colin and Orli loved.</p>

<p class="selectionShareable" style="text-align: justify;">Thank you, Colin and Orli, for sharing your home with us! We are so glad that Pedro&#8217;s team was just right for the big and small details here and hope that your home will continue to be a creative and inspiring place for you both.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-563 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/KITCHEN-DEMO.jpg" alt="KITCHEN DEMO" width="540" height="402" />My remodel got off to a roaring start.  The two site supervisors, Brian and Joe, arrived with their team one Monday morning at 9:00, as scheduled, and before lunchtime they had cleared all the fixtures and appliances from my kitchen and bathroom.  All that remained to do was tear out the floor and wall tiles, and before Tuesday afternoon they had finished that.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-573 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/BATH-03.jpg" alt="BATH 03" width="540" height="742" /></p>
<p>It was startling to see these two rooms, which I had used for eight years and knew so intimately, suddenly disappear.  Objects  that had seemed like fixed realities of my daily life (my rusting medicine cabinet, my noisy fridge, my perpetually clogged sink) were very simply removed and discarded.  It made me understand that interior design is an ephemeral art.  No doubt years from now I, or someone else, will be ripping out the appliances and finishes I&#8217;m installing now for altogether newer and more fabulous ones.</p>
<p>After demolition was complete I expected that some fundamental character of these rooms would be revealed, that I would be able see their proportions and dimensions more clearly.  But demolition made it even harder to see the rooms platonically, as empty spaces ready to be fitted out.  It exposed their gritty structure and infrastructure.  Behind the tile wainscot in the bathroom there were chaotic layers of cement blocks, mortar, plaster and lathe.  Behind drywall in the kitchen there were  overlapping plumbing, electrical and vent lines, and a rough infill of cement block and plaster.<img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-561 mt-24 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/KITCHEN-DETAIL.jpg" alt="KITCHEN DETAIL" width="540" height="421" /> Demolition did not inspire my faith; it did not excite me.  It exposed the rough, unpretty stuff that my building was made of, and the dense maze of existing utility lines.  So much of the wall behind my kitchen sink had been removed to squeeze in new plumbing and drain lines that I wondered whether it might fall over.  And, for just a moment, I wondered seriously why I had begun to remodel.</p>
