										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Seven serene retreats with tucked-in storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the rest of your home, your bedroom is a place to surround yourself with the things you love. It&#8217;s also a place for more personal trinkets and mementos, which means storage for those (and, of course, all your clothes) is key. By incorporating custom built-ins, floating shelves, and even a hidden closet, these Sweeten homeowners&#8217; private spaces are certain to inspire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22583 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22583 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, serene, storage, neutral" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22585 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22585 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, closet, serene, storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/interior-designer-rearranges-order-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney and Laurence&#8217;s</a> apartment was a huge plus—the awkward closet layout was anything but. Their contractor knocked down the four separate closets and created one dressing room to accommodate both of their wardrobes. Careful planning left ample room for two large dressers, plus a king-size bed. To top it off, their feng shui consultant advised on the furniture plan and placement to summon the harmonious, well-organized bedroom of their dreams.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft18.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-30381 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30418 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft20-723x1085.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowner&#8217;s</a> apartment boasted stunning natural light thanks to its west-facing windows—it just needed some minor storage reconfiguration to bring it up to snuff. To take advantage of the high ceilings, the contractor built open shelving across the length of the room. The original closet was moved between the bedroom and bathroom, and reimagined as a walk-in dressing room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22186" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-21-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom with built-in and window seat" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22187" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Claudia_Apartment-22-723x482.jpg" alt="close-up of built-in and window seat in bedroom" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/">Claudia</a> set out to redesign her bedroom, a window seat was at the top of her list, along with the need for more storage. In order to meet both demands, a multi-functional built-in was designed around the casement to house books and keepsakes. Staying true to her vision, a custom seat was added and topped with an upholstered cushion to create a cozy spot for curling up with a good book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22191 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with double closets" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-20415"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20415 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2-723x1085.jpg" alt="sweeten_hari_apartment-16" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/">Hari and Kaity&#8217;s</a> apartment had limited closet space and lots of square footage left over for furniture. To address growing storage concerns, the couple decided to use the far wall of the bedroom to build out a pair of full-size closets filled with custom shelving and storage. Now that they have plenty of room to store clothing and more, the original closet was transformed into an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22188" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="Modern bedroom with floating shelves" width="723" height="517" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a redesign of their apartment knocked down most of the walls in favor of an open-plan arrangement, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/">Mario and Joe</a> realized they needed more wall space to display their growing treasures from travels around the globe. Stacked floating shelves in their bedroom became the perfect solution to showcase their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22189" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with built-in for books" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a large assembly of books and a serious lack of storage space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/">Christine</a> turned to the nearly blank canvas of her bedroom for a thoughtful solution. The wall behind her bed was transformed into a library with a custom built-in that reaches from floor to ceiling, while a pewter paint finish softens the predominantly white space. Key elements for a personal library include wall sconces that are essential for reading in bed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">By preserving the wall between the bedroom and newly created walk-in dressing room, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/">Jerry and Janet</a> were able to move the closet out of sight while keeping it easily accessible. Positioning the bed in the middle of the room with the dressing area behind the headboard adds an interesting architectural element to the space. The streamlined design also complements the original 1910 window moldings that were painted black for a touch of contrast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

Here, she is able to store extra towels and other toiletries.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="Recessed cabinet in bathroom for extra storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Ross</a>, their bathroom was in need of a major overhaul. They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40140 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg" alt="freestanding blue bathroom cabinet for storage" width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A freestanding storage cabinet has the look of a built-in in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine and Chris</a> renovated bathroom. The blue-stained ash wood matches the sink vanity.</p>

They upgraded it with double mirrors, featuring storage ledges for a more modern storage interpretation.</p>

Hat tip to <a href="https://www.designsponge.com/2014/04/wise-words-by-william-morris.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Sponge</a> for reminding me of this quote:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Have nothing in your house that you don&#8217;t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.&#8221;</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;">~ William Morris, writer, artist, designer (1834-1896)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First thought: YES! So true! And such a smart antidote to our collective tendency for accumulating stuff. Second thought: perhaps if Mr. Morris had lived in 21st century New York City, he might have amended his statement to require that things be both useful and beautiful, and not one or the other. When you only have a few hundred square feet to yourself, you start to realize that beautiful things should be functional, and functional things should be beautiful. Whether you&#8217;re contemplating a renovation, enjoying a recently completed project, prepping your home to put it on the market, or just looking to make the most of what you have, may I humbly suggest a few ways to edit, de-clutter, and organize to get you out of your home and into the world this summer! With William Morris&#8217;s sage words in mind, here are three tips to get you started.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Take a look in each room of your home and separate clutter into two categories: things you can display and things you need to stow away.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lots and lots of everyday household items are really lovely. You don&#8217;t need to buy pricey accessories to make your home welcoming and useful. Open up your cabinets and grab things that don&#8217;t need to be hidden away &#8211; glassware, tea canisters, books, jewelry, plants &#8211; you are probably using storage space for things that would add visual interest and detail to a room if you took a few minutes to arrange them. To be clear: my coffee table is hardly a model for a design vignette, but after rooting around for some items that were stowed out of reach, re-purposing a glass container from a neighborhood juice spot, stacking odd books I&#8217;ve collected along the way (a French comic book, an anthology of fairy tales, a design book that was a housewarming gift from an old friend), finding a succulent that needs zero care, and moving a serving tray out of a cupboard, I have a passable little gathering spot made entirely of things I already had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11500 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png" alt="decluttering-home-nyc" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/02_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, I keep reasonably beautiful and functional items on the counter so that they are within reach, and so that they aren&#8217;t taking up storage space. Pastas are in glass jars on the counter along with olive oil, tea &#8211; all things I use daily (or, you know, when I cook on a quarterly basis) and don&#8217;t mind looking at frequently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the reverse is perhaps a bit more challenging:<span id="more-11493"></span> are there items laying around that just don&#8217;t work as carefree design accessories? If those items are neither functional nor beautiful, consider getting rid of them. If those items are functional but not beautiful, find them a new home that is out of sight. Your dining table, kitchen counter, and floors are not options, so don&#8217;t even think about it! If you must, proceed to tip #2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. If your home&#8217;s existing storage options are bursting, invest in storage that is worth displaying. </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11499 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/01_Sweeten_KerryEditting-600px.png" alt="declutter-home-nyc" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of my tea (enough with the tea? sorry!) comes in decorative canisters; some of it comes in messy boxes. I found these delightful white ceramic storage containers to store the non-glamorous tea and other cooking needs. They are stylish and functional and under $30. Below the coffee table, I stow&#8230;.wait&#8230;I can&#8217;t remember what I keep in those boxes because I never open them. Nevertheless! I have easy access to things I might be keeping in those simple Muji boxes, without having to see those items daily. I also found these Ankasa trunks that double as a side table and as a guest-bedroom (extra bedding and towels in there). If you are looking to replace furniture or re-work the lay-out of your home, hiring an interior designer will help ensure that you find pieces and accents that are both functional and beautiful. Which leads me to the third and most extreme de-cluttering tip&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Find double-duty furniture and build custom storage.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are contemplating using the oven for storage (it is SO spacious in there!), please pause. There are a handful of furniture options that take our William Morris mantra to new heights and there are ways to maximize your home&#8217;s square footage with custom storage. Benches that double as trunks, trunks that double as coffee tables, media consoles that double as benches and trunks&#8230;behold: I found this Jonathan Adler gossip bench which expands seating in my eight foot living room and simultaneously conceals winter wardrobe options. Also, I have a vacuum stored underneath, because that seemed to be the best alternative to hiding it behind my living room curtains.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The goal here is not to have a home that looks like it found its way out of a magazine cover, the goal is to spend less time managing the things you have so that you can spend more time doing the things you love.</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In March, West Village homeowner Franz posted to theSweeten in need of a contractor to create a built-in shelving unit for his studio apartment. We connected Franz with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Fork Projects</a>, who was able to do the job quickly &amp; cost-effectively &#8212; and just in time for the homeowner to leave for an extended stay abroad. While away, Franz is subletting the home to his friend Matt, who invited us to see how the project turned out. We love the new built-ins, which have made it easy for both the permanent &amp; temporary tenants to keep their belongings in the same, small space.</p>

He also caulked the edges to make the construction appear more seamless and native to the space.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8471 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg" alt="caption" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The new shelves really complete this comfy studio (and it looks like they were well-prepped for last weekend&#8217;s Derby). Here&#8217;s to another job well done!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Franz &amp; Matt, and great work to South Fork Projects!</p>
