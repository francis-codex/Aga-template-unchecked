										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elegant ways to use an apartment radiator cover to hide design eyesores</h2>
<p>Sometimes the little details of renovations fall by the wayside because there are so many design and construction decisions to make. That&#8217;s why it’s important to recognize seemingly minor updates that can have a big impact. For example, think about an apartment radiator cover. They’re not a building requirement, and they don&#8217;t influence a radiator&#8217;s efficiency. Still, this nice-to-have detail can instantly make any space look more polished and provide additional storage too.</p>
<p>Here are some ways <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners upped their radiator game. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>1. Sleek and modern</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of this Park Slope, Brooklyn renovation was <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kitchen</a>. However, the Sweeten general contractor helped complete a few other projects in the apartment, including a handsome radiator cover in the bedroom. “My growing puppy decided the cover was her favorite place to sit and watch squirrels,” the homeowner shared. “My general contractor came back to install reinforcements so it could handle the weight of a full-grown dog.”</p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37912 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg" alt="These apartment radiator covers blend in seamlessly with the white, modern room design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>2. Bookshelf camouflage</h3>
<p>Lauren’s renovation involved updating her apartment&#8217;s layout so the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and living areas were open and cohesive</a>. She focused on built-in storage in the kitchen and wanted to bring the same element to her living space. “A sleek bookshelf hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows,” she said. Plus, the radiator cover is perfect for displaying plants and knick-knacks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="This homeowner used a bookshelf to strategically hide her two apartment radiators" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>3. Repurposed design elements</h3>
<p>Architects Terri and Brett<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gutted their Prospect Heights co-op</a> to make it feel more bright and spacious. Every detail was a result of their collaboration, including radiator covers in the living area and bedroom. A millworker made the radiators easier to access for maintenances purposes. Plus, the new covers&#8217; tops were made from leftover stone slabs from the kitchen. This helped create a cohesive design throughout the whole house.</p>

<h3>4. Custom carpentry</h3>
<p>While Charon’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gorgeous green bathroom renovation</a> was in progress, her Sweeten general contractor’s carpentry team took care of other apartment details. They built a custom bedroom radiator cover to match one she already had in the living area. The new cover joined the design elements of her home and put the finishing touch on her already pretty sleep space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-bedroom-double-bed" class="alignnone wp-image-37915 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg" alt="gray bedroom with double bed and side table and window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />

<h3>4. Added storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining two apartments is no easy job</a>. Luckily, Zoe and Arvid easily overcame that challenge. Plus, they made sure to still take notice of small (and important) details in their new home. The air conditioning unit and radiator in their living had 50 years of layered paint. Not to mention, it took up valuable space. With their general contractor&#8217;s help, they designed an apartment radiator cover that made the appliance less obtrusive and added shelves for extra storage.</p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Samina, Manhattan homeowner</span><br />
<span id="more-15403"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After twelve years of living in a Union Square loft with unsealed and stained windows that wouldn&#8217;t open (and following a year-long process of dealing with Landmarks Commission permits for work in a 19th century building), we were finally at installation week for new windows in our apartment!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare, we had to have some interior shelving removed and a bit of wall board was damaged in the process. I made a split-second decision to remove the wall surrounding the windows because there had been some troubling leaks in the past, and I wanted to make sure that the quality of the wall matched the quality of the new windows. Little did I know that what I would discover in the next few hours would kick off a nearly three-year exterior building wall remediation project, for which we had no more than a thin sheet of copper separating us from the outside. Needless to say, those were some cold winters…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15404" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15406" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After this huge setback in 2012, we managed to get our new windows up in 2014 and we were given the go-ahead by the building to finally rebuild our interior wall in 2015. As a licensed architect, I understood the technical side of the work, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I still needed a contractor</a> who would be detail-oriented enough to follow my drawings and work with me on issues that arose during the construction. I reached out to my professional network but the demand for high-quality contractors made it difficult for me to engage someone on my small project. In my web searching, I came upon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. I was reassured by conversations with Sweeten’s team, who, after listening to the particularities of my project, suggested a couple of matches. My husband was the first to meet Sweeten Expert Nick while I out was out of town, and he was impressed with Nick&#8217;s positive reaction to my detailed drawings. When I then met Nick, it was immediately clear that we had a great rapport. He quickly identified the most critical elements of the project. I was surprised at how Nick appreciated my drawings and welcomed that level of detail. Many contractors want to change how drawings are done to suit their own needs, but Nick ensured that the details were covered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to achieve a clean and refined but also warm aesthetic that would complement and add to the exposed brick of our loft walls. I was also determined to insulate the wall properly and create a continuous air barrier that would reduce thermal transmission. In addition, we needed to repair a broken radiator and pipes that had exploded during the previous winter when the wall had been exposed and un-insulated, and we needed to incorporate new electric wiring and re-mount automated shades that we’d installed before but were now disconnected.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15410" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Samina_Wall-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Architecturally, there were many different “planes” to resolve: the wall’s center bay extended beyond the side windows and the sills of the side bays were higher than the center bay. Plus, the old wood windows had dictated the placement of our new aluminum windows, so we had some issues with straight lines, and the center window has a “tilt and turn” feature with a very slim frame – not a lot of wiggle room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While work was underway, Nick alerted me whenever there was a tricky issue to resolve. For example, he discovered that one of the side windows was actually an inch and a half higher than the other window and he also pointed out a spot where my drawings of how to bury a pipe were a little optimistic. We were able to work together through a cycle of conversations and quick sketches, and he also was able to reach out to his network within the same day when my own plumbing contractor fell through. He and his team were extremely meticulous in their workmanship as well as in their maintenance of the work site day to day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wall is nothing short of amazing to me. It looks like it was always meant to be that way. The radiator installation fits so nicely, and the windows are finished off with red oak trim and sills that are seamless and beautiful. The shades are hidden nicely behind matching red oak valances. The wall&#8217;s performance is even more incredible than the aesthetics. It is now so quiet in the apartment that you would never know that there is a busy New York street of shops, restaurants, and bars below. We were very happy in the end to create a warm, modern facade that highlights the views offered by our new nine-foot windows.</p>
