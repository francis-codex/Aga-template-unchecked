<p>Phoenix is a favorite place to live because of the area’s favorable weather. Precipitation is low, the sun is strong, and temperatures are high. But sometimes, the temperatures run a bit too high for comfort.</p>
<p>Each year, on average, Phoenix’s temperature exceeds 100 degrees on 92 days. Knowing this, Sweeten wrote a homeowner&#8217;s guide on how to keep your house cool in those blazing months!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>Choose the best HVAC system</h3>
<p>Air-conditioning is a fact of life in Phoenix and the entire Valley of the Sun metro area. Passive cooling methods are crucial for maintaining a cooler home in Phoenix. But it is an inescapable fact that your home needs A/C. Choose the best possible A/C within your budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the SEER ratings. SEER is short for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. This rating is listed on a yellow sticker on every central air conditioning unit. Look for high SEER numbers of at least 13. Maximize your cooling efficiency with SEER ratings of 15 to 17.</li>
<li>Properly size your A/C unit. Units incapable of handling your home’s heat will become taxed. Plus, your home will never cool down enough. Units that are larger than needed are an unnecessary expense.</li>
<li>Central A/C units are popular. But they are no longer the only game in town. Ductless mini-split units, one per room, are less expensive. Also, they do not require ductwork.</li>
<li>Look at heat pumps. Despite their name, heat pumps cool homes just like air-conditioners. The difference is that they can be reversed to heat up the home.</li>
<li>Your general contractor can discuss with you the many factors that play into the choice. These factors: building materials, type and extent of insulation, and number of windows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install insulated ductwork</h3>
<p>You wouldn’t want a water pipe riddled with holes. You would barely get any water out of it. In the same sense, the HVAC ductwork in your attic is riddled with holes when it’s uninsulated.</p>
<p>Cool air expensively generated by your air conditioner can be lost in your attic. The cool air begins at the A/C. It runs through your hot attic in basic sheet metal ducts. The cool air warms up. By the time the air reaches the rooms, it is warmer than it should be.</p>
<p>There are many insulated ductwork options you can discuss with your contractor. Sheet metal ducts with fibrous glass insulation liner or wrap are a common choice. Or fibrous glass insulation boards can be added to ducts and plenums.</p>
<h3>Buy &#8220;cooler&#8221; lighting and appliances</h3>
<p>Lights can give off an enormous amount of heat. One halogen recessed light can raise the temperature of a 64-square-foot space by 15 degrees F in about one hour. Multiplied many times over, an array of these lights can warm up a house. Use cooler LED lights. Fluorescent lights can be used in laundry rooms or work areas.</p>
<p>Also, shop for efficient appliances. Refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers all produce heat. Purchase better-designed appliances that give off less heat.</p>
<h3>Choose a &#8220;cool&#8221; roof</h3>
<p>If you have ever tried to walk on a dark roof in the summer, you will know how hot they can get. A hot roof will transmit heat into the attic. Insulation in the attic will slow some of the heat, but some heat will still enter the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool roof&#8221; is a general term for any roof with qualities that keep heat out of your house. At a minimum, a cool roof can be a light-colored roof. But a white- or light-colored roof can still absorb up to 70-percent of solar radiation. Look instead for specially coated shingles that contain glass and aluminum particles. Even traditional terra cotta roof tiles are considered to be a cool roofing material.</p>
<p>Check out cool roof ratings from the non-profit <a href="https://coolroofs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cool Roof Rating Council</a> (CRRC). The basic ratings are similar to the familiar EnergyStar ratings for appliances.</p>
<h3>Install high vents or a whole-house fan</h3>
<p>Desert temperatures that soar during the day drop equally during the night. Phoenix’s night-time temperatures are often half that of daytime temperatures. Use this to your advantage with night-flushing.</p>
<p>Night-flushing means to open up your house as much as possible during the night to flush out built-up heat. Vents installed high up on the walls can help with this. Whole-house fans pull air through open windows and send it out through the roof. This also ventilates the attic. You don’t necessarily need to install new ductwork, either. Speak to a contractor about modifying existing HVAC ductwork for a whole-house fan.</p>
<h3>Landscaping for a cooler home</h3>
<p>The City of Phoenix has an ongoing effort to cool the city—and you can do it at home, too. <a href="https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/urban-forest/tree-and-shade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix’s Tree and Shade Master Plan</a> aims to shade at least 25-percent of the city. Speak to your contractor about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding large shade trees</a> like eucalyptus, elm, pine, ash, or pecan. Even trees with less foliage like olives, palms, and citrus can keep a home cooler.</p>
<h3>Paint the home in light colors</h3>
<p>There is a reason for all of those different shades of beige on homes around Phoenix: it’s cooler. Upwards of 90-percent of the sun’s radiant energy can be absorbed by dark paint colors. Conversely, lighter colors do an excellent job of repelling radiant energy.</p>
<p>If beige isn’t your thing, you’ll find a wide range of other light colors that block the heat. Light-gray, cream, blue, ivory, and of course, white, are perfect for holding back the heat.</p>
<p>Take these steps to help keep your house cool while being more efficient for the planet and your wallet. Happy (green) renovating!</p>

<p>Whether your Phoenix home is a contemporary, mid-century modern, Spanish mission, or anything else, a renovation is your ticket to making your home your own. The first step on that journey is to estimate costs to expect for your Phoenix renovation project.</p>
<p>Sweeten offers this Phoenix renovation cost guide as a jumping-off point to help start your project. It gives you a general idea of what major renovations costs to plan for; from the kitchen to bathroom to outdoor hardscaping.</p>
<p>The keyword, though, is <em>general</em>. Every home is unique, and every homeowner differs in their tastes, so no two budgets will be the same. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of costs for some standard renovation projects in Phoenix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gut renovation: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$75</strong>—<strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf)</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$45,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></li>
<li>Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$10,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$570</strong> psf.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel and extension: Starting at <strong>$40,000</strong></li>
<li>Adding hardscaping/pavers: Starts at <strong>$30</strong> psf</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phoenix home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>A total gut renovation in Phoenix (bringing your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking,) starts at <strong>$75</strong>—<strong>$100</strong> psf for a home with budget finishes. This means installing materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependent on the scope of work and existing conditions.</p>
<p>Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once— this saves money and is more efficient.&nbsp; You’ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room.</p>
<h3>How much a Phoenix kitchen remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget kitchen in Phoenix will typically start at <strong>$15,000</strong>. To achieve this price, a rip-and-replace will keep the layout the same—oven, sink, dishwasher—to avoid the added cost of new plumbing and gas lines. You should also look for prefabricated cabinets, and shop for value appliances, tiles, countertops, and faucets at big box stores.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For a mid-grade kitchen in Phoenix, expect the starting costs to be between <strong>$25,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong>. According to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/mountain/phoenix-az/">report</a>, the average mid-grade project comes in at around <strong>$65,000</strong>. More than half of that —60 percent—is a return on investment adding to your home’s value.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a kitchen at this budget, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with semi-custom cabinets, a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet, and shop around for a budget quartz countertop. You could also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a kitchen island</a>, but the layout of anything involving a pipe or electrical wire will need to stay the same to keep costs down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A high-end kitchen renovation starts between <strong>$45,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong> while, according to the Cost Vs Value report, the average budget renovation comes in at over <strong>$132,000</strong>. Over 60 percent of that is added to your home’s value. At this level, you can go for the big-ticket item of custom cabinetry (which could take up half that budget!) You can also consider high-grade stone countertops, a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, imported tiles, designer faucets, and a built-in water filtration system.</li>
</ul>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48186 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1-600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>How much a Phoenix bathroom remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget bathroom in Phoenix typically costs between <strong>$10,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong>. Like kitchens, the best way to achieve a value budget is by keeping the layout the same. Plumbing fixtures remain in the same location. Limit your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use of tiles to the floor</a> and to part of the wall (rather than from floor to ceiling). Shopping for your materials at big box stores will also keep your budget low.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A mid-grade bathroom costs around <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$570</strong> psf for something around the 35 square foot mark, according to the Cost Vs Value report. You could purchase a porcelain-on-steel bathtub and ceramic tiles. There’s also the option of a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. Changes to the layout or plumbing will add to the budget. A project like this will add close to <strong>$14,000, </strong>or almost 70 percent of the budget to your home’s value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Expect a high-end bathroom to start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. The average budget for a high-end bathroom comes in around <strong>$63,000</strong> for Phoenix or <strong>$630</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/mountain/phoenix-az/">report</a>. That includes an expansion from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The new bathroom can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. You can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardscaping for the outdoors</h3>
<p>Phoenix is a great outdoor city in the fall, winter, and spring. With a few bells and whistles—like misters, fans, and shade—summer outdoor living is possible too. Adding or renovating hardscaping such as patio floors, retaining walls, and pavers starting at <strong>$30</strong> psf.</p>
<h3>Permit costs in Phoenix</h3>
<p>Different counties and towns around Phoenix have different fee schedules. Fees are often calculated by the total cost of the project or the size (square footage).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gilacountyaz.gov/2020Building/FEESCHEDULE%2012-2019.pdf">Fees</a> in Gila County are tied to the cost of the project. For example, a project with a budget of <strong>$60,000</strong> will cost a little over <strong>$700</strong> in permitting fees. A project that is <strong>$20,000</strong> will cost about <strong>$320</strong> in fees. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits each start at <strong>$25</strong>.</p>
<p>In Maricopa County, <a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6576/List-of-Initial-Fees-by-Permit-Type-PDF?bidId=">fees</a> for additions or alterations start at <strong>$110</strong>. If your project involves electrical, plumbing, or mechanical then it will attract at least another <strong>$60</strong>.</p>
