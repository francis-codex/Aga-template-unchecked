			<h2>These closet renovations set up a tidy system, from shoes and clothes to kids’ toys</h2>
<p class="p1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg" alt="closet renovation with three doors in master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35239" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-16-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A closet renovation can be designed and built into life-changing organizational tools. With the help of a general contractor or designer, smaller closets can be combined to make one large one. In addition, rearranging a room’s layout may reveal underutilized floor space that transforms into storage. These Sweeten homeowners show how they tamed the clutter and simplified their everyday.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A wall-to-wall closet renovation regains space (and hides a TV!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43436" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Toby-closet-3.gif" alt="bedroom closet renovation with sliding doors and shoe storage" width="900" height="1350" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>W<span class="s1">ith a handful of design courses under his belt, </span><span class="s1">Toby put his passion for design to good use during his home renovation. He had given away the square footage of his bedroom closet to his bathroom located in the next room. To make up for this, he designed and built a new full-length closet for clothes and shoes with sliding doors. The built-in also hid a dresser and tv.</span></p>
<h3>Adding 3 custom closets for even <em>more</em> functional space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38719" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg" alt="Kensington, renovation, closet" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Barbra_closet_still2-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a big factor in Barbra and Sean’s apartment renovation. Closets went into one of the kids&#8217; rooms, the entryway, and the master bedroom (<em>pictured above</em>). In the master, their Sweeten contractor suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining two smaller units</a> into a single large one with a custom organization system. </span><span class="s2">“There’s a lot more functional space now,” Barbra said. “I even have some halfway empty dresser drawers. I wish I had done all the closets. Someday!”</span></p>
<h3>A toy closet renovation keeps playthings neat—and out of sight</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37994" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, nursery closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-15-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">This Brooklyn homeowner chose a neutral palette for her son’s room; the better choice as a backdrop for all of his colorful toys. Even toy closets can offer a visual respite and functional organization. “</span><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building out the closets</a> was essential to allowing us to settle in properly, and I’m glad we didn’t wait to do this (which was the original plan),” said the homeowner.</span></p>
<h3>Closets for extra shoe organization (87 pairs worth!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28034 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-02-04.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard closet build doesn’t give a lot of thought to shoe storage, so if you’re really into footwear, you’ll be faced with the problem of where to store them all. With 87 pairs of shoes in need of storage, Matthew had <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a custom closet designed</a> with pull-out drawers showing off a pop of orange. The drawers were each sized to his size 9 shoes and hidden behind a sleek panel door.</p>
<h3><strong>Walk-in bliss for a Brooklyn closet renovation </strong></h3>
<h3><strong><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg" alt="small walk-in closet with door and hardwood floors and track lights after renovation" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-51189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-11.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></strong></h3>
<p>Combining two cramped, unlit closets into one cohesive unit topped the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-crown-heights-duo-takes-on-their-bathroom-and-closet-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation to-do list</a> for Kate and Max. They wanted to increase their overall storage space and add much-needed lighting so they could access their items more easily. Their Sweeten contractor removed a wall separating the two smaller closets, keeping the closet&#8217;s main access point in their bedroom.</p>
<h3><strong>Kids&#8217; bedroom closets keep family living room clutter-free </strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36113" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg" alt="closet organization" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With two active little boys in an 800-square-foot junior one-bedroom co-op, Courtney and Jim’s main goal was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create more storage</a> in their sons’ room. They only requested one closet but their Sweeten contractor found space for a second closet in their room without sacrificing floor space. To keep their toys, sports items, and musical instruments from spilling into the common living areas, a thoughtful <span class="s1">organizational system was designed</span> in the existing closet.</p>
<h3><strong>Combining three small closets into two large custom units</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 size-chrono" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A layout change that resulted in opening the kitchen to the living room gave Marissa and Cody the opportunity to demolish the three narrow closets in the main living area and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build two larger ones</a>. By taking down the walls between the closets, the couple was able to increase their storage by making use of what was previously dead space between the walls.</p>
<h3><strong>A hideaway custom closet renovation mimics the luxury of a walk-in </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25188 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Flooring-05-06.gif" alt="closet renovation ideas, custom closets, storage solutions, organization" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Michael and Chenta decided to overhaul the existing closet in their bedroom. They had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/designers-concrete-floors-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large closet built</a> with simple, oak doors and added a floating wall in front of it. The wall separated their closet from the rest of the bedroom, giving it the feeling of a walk-in closet while still allowing the space between the wall and the closet to be used as a walkway.</p>
<h3><strong>An IKEA closet renovation with motion-sensor lights </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-20.gif" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-35244 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35244 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sweeten-MaggieRossAdam-Spiegel-Apt-20.gif" alt="home renovation, closet renovation, built-in closets, organization" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe Maggie and Adam&#8217;s bedroom closets aren&#8217;t custom. For a made-to-order look, their Sweeten contractor<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> framed the IKEA closets</a> and installed LED lighting with motion sensors so the lights would turn on when the doors opened. The brass hardware gave a final refined touch, plus tied in with the hardware elsewhere in the home.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shoe storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="shoe storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Match an entire apartment to a previous renovation and build dream shoe storage in Hell’s Kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Matthew, the managing director of a fashion advertising agency, bought his apartment in 2012, only half of it had gone through a renovation. A few elements, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and floors, were in the present. Everything else stood sadly in the past. The old radiators stuck out like sore thumbs. So did the sliding doors of the storage closets. Then Matthew had the sartorial problem of 87 pairs of shoes stacked up against a wall in the one-bedroom co-op.  “I really wanted to bring the entire apartment up to a modern, minimalist, clutter-free design,” said Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Much of the design was done from scratch, so Matthew <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4676#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and worked with his design/build <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. “We literally went through twenty design options for the shoe closet alone,” Matthew said. But the outcome was worth it. The shoe storage is designed to Matthew’s shoe size, which is a nine. There is room for 90 pairs, including his favorites, Common Projects Blush sneakers and black Gucci loafers. The radiator in the living space is hidden under a desk where Matthew can sit for breakfast by the window. In the bedroom, a dressing bench, flanked by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>, covers up the other radiator. The remaining closet doors were replaced to match the wood veneer of the shoe storage. Each door has hidden hardware and pops open when it is pushed, eliminating the need for handles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the renovation evolved, the Sweeten contractor also installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden storage unit</a> next to the laundry to utilize every inch of space in the 790-square-foot apartment. They also encouraged Matthew to replace the window trimmings to match the custom carpentry. “We did one window first and I loved it, so we just did every window,” Matthew said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matthew has a strong affection for the color orange. Its presence in his renovation was a must. “I wanted it in there but didn’t want it to be obnoxious,” he said. After bouncing around various options of visibility, Matthew settled on adding it to the inside of his shoe closet. “You have to open the closet and pull out a drawer, but I see it every day,” he said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Custom desk (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/office/desks/parsons-desks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a>. White desk chair (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.dwr.com/kitchen-dining-chairs-benches/111-navy-chair/3773.html?lang=en_US#q=navy%2Bchair&amp;lang=en_US&amp;start=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Within Reach</a>.
