										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn cookspace pivots big-time by adding a peninsula, impressive kitchen storage—and yes, pulling down the ceiling</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24130 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: Reimagine kitchen storage and appliances in <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span class="s2">: The family of four—Emily, Trey, and their two sons—spent almost five years in their downtown Brooklyn condo before pulling the trigger on a kitchen renovation. By then, Emily, who cooks dinner about five times a week, knew she really needed a double oven and more efficient kitchen storage—their open shelving would never look clean and organized the way she wanted. The current oven couldn’t even fit a cookie tray and the tiny dishwasher measured only 18 inches across. The kitchen lights above flickered and a lowered ceiling—thanks to a loft overhead—made for a dark and oppressive space. “We put stuff up there that we hardly touched the entire time we have lived here,” said Emily. The style was a strange mix of wood and stainless steel, including an industrial-style sink that was reminiscent of an operating table.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A problem area in the renovation was the intercom attached to a pole that sat in a prominent spot in the kitchen. It could not be moved according to the building’s alteration agreement. The family’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">Sweeten contractor</span></a> ended up working the peninsula around the pole. That wide and bright L-shaped peninsula also became the perfect meeting place for the couple’s two kids to sit while Emily cooks. With the storage loft gone and the ceiling raised, the kitchen is unrecognizable. The relatively small space (about 8’ x 10’) prompted the new design to utilize every inch of the space. The plan for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen storage</a> included cupboards in two dead corners—one at the end of the peninsula and another behind the far left bar stool. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Near the completion of the project, Emily fell in love with some yellow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pendant lights</a>. However, the color clashed with the vibrant blue backsplash tiles that were all set to be installed. Instead, Emily swapped it for a muted gray backsplash tile and the non-refundable blue ones will likely become a feature of an upcoming bathroom renovation.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reorganize an awkward space</a> in this kitchen renovation</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: </span><span class="s1">Meredith and Jason’s apartment building in Chelsea was comprised of four townhouses that had been combined. The result was a kitchen with plenty of issues: Dark mahogany cabinets obscured the only window, blocking precious natural light. The kitchen island in a too-small space meant you could only walk around it if you brushed yourself up against a wall. A slightly raised floor made for regular toe-stubbing if you weren’t paying attention. A kitchen renovation was definitely in order.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The couple took some time getting an idea of what they wanted. Meredith took ownership of the aesthetics and Jason, the family cook, focused on creating a functional space. Despite the awkward island, Meredith still liked the idea of having one. After wrestling with the design, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor</span></a> suggested a wide peninsula. &#8220;As soon as I saw the drawing, I was on board with it,” said Meredith. This helped double the counter space and gives her a place to sit and work while Jason prepares dinner. The new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood floor</a> was lowered an inch, eliminating the risk to toes, and now matches the rest of the apartment, making the kitchen feel “bigger, brighter and cleaner,” she said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom cabinetry</a> freed the window for maximum natural light. The microwave was placed under the peninsula rather than above the range so Jason could install his dream <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hood</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: </span><span class="s1">The ceiling dropped about a foot in the old kitchen and a previous contractor said it could not be lifted. When their Sweeten contractor came in and found a way to lift it about seven inches, it was a big relief for the couple.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">John lived in his two-bedroom Hell’s Kitchen co-op apartment for practically a decade before addressing a number of areas in the home that had been neglected over time. Stately pre-war molding from the early 1920s was buried under years of paint, ancient water damage permeated some walls, electrical outlets were sparse&#8211;even door knobs were finicky. Ready to make significant changes to the kitchen, bedrooms, and book storage space just in time for Katharine to move in, the couple—both behind-the-scenes professionals in the entertainment industry—needed a crew to help transform their home into a modern day co-op with old-world charm. Read on for John’s take on their thoroughly ambitious home renovation!</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/john-and-katharines-sweetened-manhattan-apartment-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18042" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg" alt="manhattan apartment renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/katharine-apartment-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by John, Hell’s Kitchen homeowner </span></i><span id="more-18013"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the apartment was largely in its original, 1923 state. We loved a lot of the classic details but many of them had begun to decay and the plaster walls were in various states of disrepair. It was increasingly difficult to keep clean. So, the primary goal was to restore the walls and floors to good working order, replace the trim and molding that was falling apart, and generally remove a lot of the cluttered and clashing elements that had built up over the years. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen had been redone at least once, probably in the late 90s, but the life of that renovation was ending and the cabinets were breaking and falling apart. We wanted to find a way to make the small kitchen/living room space work. We weren’t making substantial structural changes and wouldn&#8217;t be moving plumbing or gas, but the whole space definitely needed a general cosmetic and electrical make-over. So, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find a design and construction team to take on the work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18037 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18039 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18041" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room, especially, was a challenge. It had a reasonably sized kitchen, which is great because I cook a lot, but finding a way to balance the space between kitchen and living room without shortchanging either was really the central problem we tackled. It had previously been semi-divided by a wall and an island which left the corner around the couch dark and cramped, and still didn&#8217;t allow for a full-sized fridge. We removed the wall and created a central island that could function as both a work space and a dining table. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I splurged on a dual-fuel Wolf range, which was right up against the realm of possibility given the amount of available power to the apartment, but which I&#8217;m pretty happy about (a gas stovetop is basically essential, as far as I&#8217;m concerned). The refrigerator is a 32&#8243; french door model, not quite &#8220;full sized&#8221;; I found the unit that offered the most storage volume but which could still physically fit, with the doors removed, into the small freight elevator in our building. We originally had a slightly larger model that did not fit. I toyed with recruiting friends to help me carry it up to the tenth floor. In retrospect, this probably would have been a mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The microwave is also Wolf; they make a unit that opens like a drawer and can be loaded from the top, rather than the traditional swing door style. It&#8217;s a little silly but this allowed us to install it in the kitchen island facing away from the front door, rather than in the more normal spot above the stove. I don&#8217;t use the microwave a ton and it seemed silly to give it that front and center pride of place; better to have the nice custom cabinet-fronts there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got fairly traditional knobs and miscellaneous hardware; we used unlacquered brass for the &#8220;living room&#8221; side of the main room and nickel for the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; side as a way to differentiate the shared space. We love the brass; the original knobs and apartment hardware are all nearly 100-year-old brass, and we specifically sought out the unlacquered pieces, which seem a little less common, because our hope is that over the years they will patina and start to take on some of the character of the old ones. Most of our miscellaneous hardware pieces are from Simon&#8217;s Hardware and Bath, and we&#8217;ve been pretty happy with them. We got slightly funky drawer pulls from Urban Archaeology, which were pricey, but which we really love. The pendant lights are from O&#8217;Lampia, a shop on the Bowery; the guy there makes custom pieces that we both really like, and we would enthusiastically recommend him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen faucet is Rohl, less expensive than the ubiquitous Waterworks (which is what I used for the bathroom renovation in 2008) and supposedly, at least according to our plumber, more reliable. Lever handles are key for me for a kitchen faucet, since it&#8217;s difficult to turn on cross handles with your elbows when your hands are covered in raw chicken. Having the spout elevated as high above the sink as possible is also pretty important to me, it allows more space to work when washing dishes (no dishwashers allowed in my building!).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would count our (very consciously UN-oiled) blue/green soapstone on the kitchen island among our riskier&#8211;but ultimately most rewarding&#8211;design choices. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the apartment, we wanted to maintain as much of the pre-war character as possible, while also lightening and opening up the space. There was picture frame molding partway up the walls, which we replaced with crown molding at the ceiling. The style is similar but it makes the ceilings feel higher and complements the many beams without calling too much attention to them. Most of the choices we made were along these lines, classic in style but slightly more understated than the original as befits a fairly small apartment. We refurbished and kept original elements where we could, like the heavy doors and metal door frames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built in a lot of shelves and cabinets in order to maximize space and we opened-up the awkwardly placed living room closet (originally blocked by the couch) to make a kind of library/office nook that also makes the space feel larger.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18038 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-During-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18034 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="office nook" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Katharine_Apartment-11-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For non-decorative lighting in the smaller spaces, we went with simple schoolhouse ceiling fixtures that are pretty similar to what was originally installed, again with brass accents. To fill out the three rooms, we also added track lighting, which is perhaps a little unusual. They are fairly unobtrusive and allow a lot of coverage, flexibility, and directionality while staying as close to the ceiling as possible (we would have had to drop the ceiling to install in-ceiling lights). We accented with warm-tone, high CRI LED fixtures in places where they could be installed, like in cabinets, the hallways, and in the kitchen.</span></p>
