After realizing how special the views of Irving Place were in the bedroom, they knew they wanted to bridge the gap between rooms. This allowed for a seamless flow and brought the light and scenery of Irving Place near Gramercy Park to more of the space. </span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 2.1333333333333333; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;"><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; white-space-collapse: preserve;">&#8220;We wanted to update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/">kitchen</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/">bathroom</a>. And open the area between the bedroom and living room—because then the view of Irving Place could be seen from the living room as well. And we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">built-in shelves</a>,&#8221; shares the homeowner, illuminating the primary objectives of the project.</span></p>					</div>

				<p><b>Storage and design details coalesce</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working alongside their Sweeten contractor, the renovation unfolded effortlessly, with a primary focus on enhancing light and incorporating storage solutions. The compact kitchen saw a transformation pairing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/">marble</a> countertop and backsplash and sleek dark wood <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/">custom cabinets</a>. While finding thin set tiles for the bathroom proved challenging, the blue painterly tiles are almost reminiscent of clouds and create a relaxing escape. As there are many tile showrooms located just a few blocks from the apartment, the homeowners were able to search exhaustively to find the perfect hue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their contractor introduced unique design solutions, crafting a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/creative-radiator-covers/">radiator cover</a> that doubled as a bench for added storage and seating—a seamless fit for the narrow entrance to the kitchen. Bespoke bookshelves with concealed storage and a pull-out compartment for the record player curated a perfect balance of functionality and aesthetics in the living room. While handpicked fabrics from Katie Leede and Peter Dunham add a personalized touch and bring the envisioned coziness to life.</span></p>					</div>

			<h3 class="p1">Yes, it <em>is</em> possible to live through a kitchen remodel, with a few key remodeling tips in hand</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg" alt="Kitchen in the middle of a renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52709" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/live-through-kitchen-remodel-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Remodeling your kitchen is a smart move and you’ll be pleased that you took the leap and did it. However, for a short time during the project, you might feel some&#8230;frustration, especially if you are accustomed to being at home most days.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s all manageable, however, and you’ll do fine if you know what to expect. It’s all about adaptability and making as many choices proactively as possible. Get things set up before it feels like an emergency. You’ll be inconvenienced for several weeks or so, if the project goes as planned. Sweeten outlines how to live through a kitchen remodel below.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Set up a temporary kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1">Naturally, you’ll have to feed the family and clean up after meals and snacks, so you’ll need some sort of temporary kitchen. If you have room for a temporary kitchen, old dismantled kitchen cabinets could create a makeshift mini-kitchen space. Even some of the old countertop could be used.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t have an extra room, where can you carve out some space for, say, 2–4 weeks? You might use the patio/deck and grill for a lot of cooking and the default dining table, if the weather cooperates.</p>
<p class="p1">Moving the refrigerator to a space where it’s still usable is typically mandatory. Go over changes like these with the contractor so you don’t block a space they’ll need to access.</p>
<p class="p1">You might wonder if the fridge can move to the deck or patio, and it’s possible, but it&#8217;ll depend on the weather. Refrigerators have an ambient operating temperature range, and if the outdoor temperature goes below ~40 degrees, the compressor won’t run. If the compressor doesn’t run, then the freezer won’t work. Likewise, avoid setting a refrigerator in full sun. The heat will force the compressor to work much harder and more often, which will shorten its life.</p>
<h4>Cooking without a normal kitchen</h4>
<p class="p1">Cooking is really pretty easy. You can use a camp stove, toaster oven, microwave oven, instant pot, and/or grill for numerous meals. You probably can’t move and use your freestanding range, as they require a 240v outlet and dedicated circuit for power.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Staying at home during a kitchen remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are accustomed to being at home quite a bit, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of construction might unnerve you</a>. Naptime for the kids will be tough to keep going, as will any work duties you plan to accomplish. Going to the office a bit more may turn into an attractive option, along with coffee shops and shared office spaces.</p>
<p class="p1">Do the daily work hours work for you? Tradespeople often start early and their work is often noisy. If you like to sleep in, you will probably chafe at having workers at the house early in the morning, but that’s what it takes—temporarily.</p>
<p class="p1">Talk with your contractor about the daily schedule to set shared expectations. Surprises happen and everyone has to roll with them. An organized and professional contractor will set you up as well as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Living in a hotel during the remodel</h3>
<p class="p1">Another option that has unique benefits is staying at a hotel. You can choose a standard stay or an extended-stay suite, which may even have a mini-kitchen. These offer clear and compelling advantages: low commitment and high flexibility, as in booking and leaving with little notice.</p>
<p class="p1">Cost may seem high but it may be well worth it to avoid the chaos of living in a remodeling zone. You will have to live somewhere during the work, so a hotel could be just part of the project budget.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Create a contingency plan to cover surprises</h3>
<p class="p1">Finally, have a contingency budget plan of 10-15% if something goes awry. The worst-case scenario would be something like discovering asbestos or mold, which must be professionally remediated. Those professionals are specialty crews, not your contractor or subcontractors. That could stop other work until they are done. There’s no good way to estimate how long that work could take, but your general contractor will know how to find the experts and rearrange the schedule and sequencing.</p>
<p class="p1">Other common scenarios are occasional shortages of materials or <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistakes in ordering or fulfillment</a>. Special-order items, for example, can be subject to delays. Luckily, a good contractor can peruse your plan and spot potential bottlenecks quickly, but it’s good to be prepared.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a lot to consider for a kitchen remodel, but the hassle is temporary and the benefit is long term. With preparation and a flexible mindset, you’ll be on the way to your dream kitchen.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with homeowners Danielle and Michelle</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remodeling a converted condo in Hoboken, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We purchased our home in June 2020, a 1,100-square-foot condominium in a former 1800s schoolhouse. The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character—our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with bar seating and black cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52149" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/67197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project on Sweeten</a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn’t long before we found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a contractor we felt was a great fit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms’ shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated—we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.</span></p>
<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo’s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg" alt="View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52151" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg" alt="Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52150" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage</a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets—they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they’re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began—she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world’s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don’t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand—this fridge holds seven.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg" alt="Black cabinets, stainless steel appliances, white marble counters, natural wood shelving" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52153" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05.jpg" alt="Black kitchen cabinets with white backsplash and counter" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52152" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper and black paint for a bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went with a statement wallpaper</a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg" alt="Bathroom with walk-in shower, vanity, and large mirror" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Managing during the home remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w</span><span class="s1">e retreated to Danielle’s parents’ home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn’t conducive to phone calls—we didn’t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was hard not being able to see the project’s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating—ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg" alt="Bathroom with black and white walls and vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg" alt="Bathroom with glass shower door and black matte hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn’t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tips on staying on budget</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is—the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn’t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you’re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We’ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.</span></p>

<h3>Keeping their Jackson Heights remodel in view<span>—for years</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We purchased our co-op roughly three years before embarking on the renovation. Our goal was to totally revamp the apartment into open-plan spaces, while preserving its period features. Like many pre-war homes, it had a lot of small rooms. I think our result is proof that, even if there’s no perfect moment to remodel, intensive planning pays off.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Keeping historic details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The 1,400-square-foot unit is located in a 1921 historical-district co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens. The place hadn’t been touched since the 1970s and was in rough shape. But there were nice original details, like beautiful wood floors with inlaid borders and a period fireplace. It needed a significant overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dia and I didn’t rush it. We’d rented in the neighborhood for a couple of years to make sure we liked the area—and we did. After finding the co-op, we wanted to take our time and put our stamp on it. We spent almost two years planning the remodel. By the time we were ready to proceed, Dia was pregnant with our daughter, Madeleine. We were eager to get the job done, and ready to pick up the pace. </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">In-depth research and planning </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. We made clear in our overview that we were ready to obtain our co-op board approvals, navigate the permitting, order materials, and get started. By then we’d spent a lot of time planning the layout, materials, and finishes. We had 40 pages of diagrams, renderings, and materials lists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Five or six Sweeten contractors came for site visits and gave us estimates. Right away, one stood out. He had printed out our mammoth set of plans (which he jokingly referred to as “the bible”), came armed with excellent questions, spoke knowledgeably about what would and would not be possible given NYC building codes, and gave us a detailed and reasonable estimate. We knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wanted to hire him</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">A gut remodel with an extensive to-do list </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Going in, we made sure the contractor understood that we had a specific vision, and that we were demanding. We planned to open the kitchen, living, and dining rooms, build a modern kitchen, renovate both bathrooms to spa standards, and add closet space. At the same time, we intended to keep original details, and even increase them by adding period chandeliers and other fixtures that would complement the co-op’s 1920s style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Dark blue built-in cabinets and shelving with white counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52013" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/50730-Alex-Kitchen-Closet-01.gif" alt="Built-in kitchen closet storage with doors opening and closing" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52006" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our renovation scope was specific. It included replacing and relocating the breaker box, and installing new switches and sockets. We wanted to remove several unnecessary walls, and rebuild two walls and two water-damaged window encasements. We requested new baseboards and crown moldings. In the kitchen, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to add a peninsula</a>, a custom pantry, and a sideboard. We wanted to build closets in the bedrooms and entryway, as well as custom cabinets and radiator covers. We’d paint every room and refinish the floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Problem solving with the general contractor team</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Several miracles occurred in the kitchen. When we removed a wall to make way for the new peninsula, it resulted in a break in the floor inlay, but the floor subcontractor recreated the </span><span class="s2">multi-wood pattern so skillfully that you can’t tell what is original and what is new. Our appliance vendor’s repeated delivery delays caused a need for our countertops to be installed before the appliances. Our Sweeten contractor got them in when they arrived, despite incredible difficulty—installing our refrigerator even required removing the baseboard temporarily.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When our single-piece sideboard countertop was too big for the elevator, the guys carried them up five flights of stairs. And when the new electrical box occupied the former microwave place, the cabinetmaker came up with a built-in pantry, designed with an interior cutout to fit the oven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In our bathroom, we had other inspired solutions. We wanted to move the toilet but a steel beam prevented placement in the new rough-in location. Our contractor proposed a wall-hung toilet that freed up space for it to stay in the original location and squeezed in a vanity, which wasn’t possible with the traditional commode. Thanks to supply-chain disruptions during Covid-19, we ended up sourcing bathroom tile other than that from our original wishlist—and the manufacturer offered no coordinating trim. Our general contractor found a trim that matched and drove more than 700 miles to collect every piece they could find.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Homeowners share their renovation advice</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, our biggest questions from the beginning were about how to manage the many subcontractors and aspects of the work happening simultaneously. But our Sweeten contractor pulled it all together. Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B. We certainly learned the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweeten-renovator-reviews-10-things-they-loved-about-their-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of picking the right contractor</a>—one who inspires confidence and keeps your best interests at heart.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We couldn’t have asked for a more professional and dedicated team. At the start, he helped us gather the necessary co-op board sign-offs and connected us with an architect. He managed the permitting process seamlessly, despite NYC Department of Buildings changes during Covid-19.

			<h2>Six open concept kitchen ideas by Sweeten imbue space, flow, and natural light</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>When asked what they want in a kitchen remodel, many homeowners echo the same idea: an open-concept kitchen. Gone are the days of the kitchen being cordoned off. No more swinging doors or small entryways. Renovators want big, open spaces that connect the kitchen to the dining area and sometimes to the living room, too. It is a modern concept that is both inviting and multifunctional. It also can give a smaller space the appearance of more square footage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, a look at six o</span>pen concept kitchen ideas from <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten renovations that make kitchens the star of the remodel. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A soaring ceiling for the win</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="marble-countertop-kitchen-island"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="marble countertop on kitchen island with white cabinets and brown vinyl flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="1250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41789" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-240x300.jpg 240w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann looked for a contractor for two years to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update her dark and dated kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in East Hampton. She wanted a space that was welcoming and large enough to accommodate her family and guests. A place that felt open and airy and just enjoyable to be in. She finally pulled the trigger on the renovation after finding a contractor through Sweeten. They teamed up to create the bright, airy kitchen of Ann’s dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann knew she wanted the faux-brick backsplash and dark cabinetry replaced with lighter, more modern options. To go along with that contemporary update, Ann also decided to remove the wall between the dining area and cook space. But the ultimate game-changer was the detail her contractor recommended: a cathedral ceiling. Bumping up the ceiling added a feeling of spaciousness far above and beyond just taking down a wall. It gives the space a grand appearance and regal style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just love having the open space, where everyone can sit and hang out together,” Ann said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen opens up</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin lived in their Bronx home</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a year-and-a-half before they decided to renovate. It was time. They were tired of the small, inefficient 124-square-foot </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-make-a-galley-kitchen-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">galley kitchen.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They wanted more natural light. To make this happen, their Sweeten contractor took down the wall between the kitchen and entryway. He also removed a partial wall between the kitchen and dining, effectively connecting the two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="kitchen cabinet styles" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41638" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the kitchen was still on the smaller side, they had to get creative with storage. They included a peninsula breakfast bar that seats four to six and features additional storage. Glass-front cabinets, a microwave cabinet, and a built-in paper towel holder are all prime examples of their extra storage solutions. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen,” said Elizabeth. Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Flooring that ties it all together</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49429" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many, living through the pandemic made</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amy and Kevin re-evaluate their living situation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The conclusion? It was time to make the move to get more space. So they purchased a 1950s home in Los Angeles, California. From the get-go, they knew it needed to be remodeled to fit their work-from-home lifestyle. In addition to turning two of their three bedrooms into office space, they wanted to rethink their kitchen and living room.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg" alt="custom kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49430" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their Sweeten contractor recommended widening the kitchen doorway and removing part of the six-foot wall to help the L-shaped kitchen flow. This opened the kitchen up to the living area. To unify the two spaces that were now one, they chose white-oak engineered hardwood in eight-inch planks. They felt this would showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel more cohesive. In addition, they created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. This gave them the additional room to add a large pantry—a must-have for most renovators. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is a gorgeous home with space for both of us to do our things,” says Amy. “I’m so happy!”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A more kid-friendly remodel</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-peninsula-with-quartz-countertop"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen peninsula with quartz countertop and pendant lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51253" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha is a stay-at-home mom and Jameson is an executive at a creative agency. They loved their Clinton Hill, Brooklyn co-op but it wasn’t optimal for their family of four. The couple wanted a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/kid-friendly-apartment-renovation-with-soundproofing-and-open-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">space that was more kid-friendly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out,” said Samantha. To achieve this they decided to renovate. They opened the kitchen to the living room. This way Samantha can see the family in the living room while she’s cooking in the kitchen. Plus, they added a breakfast counter with a cut-out. It serves as the perfect setting for homework—a win-win as Samantha can be doing dishes or prepping meals while she helps the kids with their school work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also rethought their old layout. They switched the dining area, which was previously by the window, with the living room sofa to make the table easily reachable. Samantha says her new open-concept kitchen is “an absolute pleasure.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A tight New Jersey home gains valuable kitchen space</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45614" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this Sweeten renovator and his wife moved to Montclair, New Jersey, they knew <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the home they bought needed a lot</a> of updates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was one of the first projects on their list. The house was almost a hundred years old and it looked its age. It was small, with “looming” cabinets all around. There were only eight feet of usable counter space. And the stove looked like it was out of a 1940s movie. Not to mention the cracked “McDonald&#8217;s” tiles (red terracotta tiles that are found in some older McDonald&#8217;s restaurants). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg" alt="New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45621" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the renovation was to gain square footage and a better layout. Their Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plan was to tear down two walls. One had an old butler’s pantry. By removing it, they gained 18 square feet of space. That was enough to add an island. They also turned the unused cellar entryway into a walk-in pantry. The other wall that they removed was between the kitchen and dining room. Once it was down, the kitchen really took shape—their open-concept kitchen idea transformed the first floor with improved flow and natural light.</span></p>
<h3><strong>An open concept kitchen idea joins minimalism with functionalism</strong></h3>

They reveled in the natural light that beamed in. What they didn’t love, however, was the functionality or feel of their already-open kitchen. It didn’t match their Scandinavian style and had little to no counter space. They wanted a more open space with integrated appliances, clean lines, and minimal clutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg" alt="wooden slab front kitchen cabinet door designs" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked with a Sweeten contractor and used the IKEA kitchen design tool to develop a new layout. The result is a gorgeous space with a walnut matte finish. The kitchen is seamlessly integrated into the living and dining area, with no walls to be seen anywhere. This open kitchen concept idea lets the family cook, dine, and hang out with ease all together. “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming,” said the couple. “It fits our needs and it feels like home.”</span></p>

<li><strong>Where:</strong> Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Outfit their 1,500-square-foot Bed-Stuy home with a new kitchen, bath, and open-concept living area</li>
<li><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s role:</strong> <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reimagining the Bed-Stuy home for family life</h3>
<p>This Bedford-Stuyvesant home once belonged to the homeowner&#8217;s grandmother. The home came with fond memories of her childhood, so she happily inherited it. However, as the townhouse had been built in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it needed a lot of work. She would remodel it to accommodate the needs of her own family. They planned for an open concept layout, with open sightlines to keep the family together while in different rooms. To modernize the spaces, they&#8217;d outfit their dream kitchen and bathroom with new, state-of-the-art appliances and finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg" alt="Exterior of the Bed-Stuy home with front yard and metal gate" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>She turned to Sweeten to find a contractor she&#8217;d be comfortable with handling this important renovation. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> with experience in old-home remodels. They signed the contract and the work began!</p>
<h3>Necessary behind-the-wall updates</h3>
<p>First, fixing the systems behind the walls had to be done to support updated materials and appliances. The plumbing had corroded and was located in inefficient places. The electrical also needed to be upgraded. Their Sweeten contractor found improperly connected wires in the ceiling, which posed a fire hazard. The subfloor had to be ripped out, and the joists had to be reinforced to keep the kitchen floor from collapsing.</p>

<p>All this work made the kitchen functional and safe. The design aesthetic came next. The homeowner chose a contemporary combination of white cabinets along the kitchen perimeter, and gray base cabinets for the island. The owners selected quartz countertops for the work surface, due to their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonable price point and durability</a>. The island became the focal point of the room, which also featured deliberate pops of color, like the must-have bright red range. Other features, such as a gold-finish pot filler, pull-out storage cabinets, and a built-in wine rack, completed the look.</p>
<h3>New layout and features</h3>
<p>The rest of the Bed-Stuy home benefited from the remodel, too. Their contractor removed a wall between the kitchen and living area to open up the flow. They also installed new wood floors, along with all-new recessed lights, a closet, and a front door. Another addition: a new laundry room, which replaced an existing screened-in porch area. The contractor fully outfitted the laundry room—from reconstructing electrical, plumbing, and insulation to subflooring and venting.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the master bathroom</h3>
<p>Like the kitchen, the master bathroom would become her dream bathroom. As a mom, it would be her sanctuary. A standalone tub would give her the chance to unwind. The construction crew faced a challenge: nestling the tub into a tight niche without damaging or touching the walls. But the crew completed the task handily, with the result being an inviting clawfoot oasis, flanked on one end by a custom vanity. In a nod to wainscoting, the team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed the bathroom tile</a> halfway up the wall.</p>

<h3>Working with the right contractor</h3>
<p>For this nostalgic renovation, the homeowner saw and worked with her Sweeten contractor for months. Fortunately, she found the right partner who understood her vision. This partnership allowed them to communicate throughout the process and solve problems when issues arose. A solid working bond between the client and Sweeten contractor formed, so much so, when it looked like their renovation would not be done in time for Thanksgiving, their contractor invited them to celebrate with his family. Luckily, their new home is now ready to create brand new memories for years to come.</p>

<p>Though Erin and Jonathan’s West Village kitchen in their 750-square-foot apartment was, for the most part, functional, it didn’t suit their style. Another downside: the kitchen did not make the best use of the available space. Open to the living area, there was plenty of room to add the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in island</a> on the couple’s wish list, plus reimagine the layout. Ready to bid farewell to the ‘80s cabinetry and shabby tile flooring, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a> and were matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Picking renovation materials and kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The basic kitchen transformed into a bright, modern marvel complete with new stainless steel appliances, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/sleek-waterfall-island-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall island</a>, and light fixtures. The overall contemporary culinary space also got some more classic updates, like the Shaker-style cabinets and herringbone tile backsplash. To connect the kitchen with the rest of the living area, 5-inch white oak flooring was installed throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A French door refrigerator replaced the older model, while the new dishwasher (that has a window and lights up!) moved to the stove&#8217;s previous location. A stainless steel hood and gas range found a new central location in the space across from the storage-packed island.</p>
<h3>Working through the renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor brought the couple’s vision to life, ensuring everything was on time and on budget. “The contractor’s app was also a very helpful tool for us to make material selections and track the progress of the project,” Jonathan said. Their contractor provided valuable input, guiding them on sourcing materials, layout, and space considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The entire process was intimidating. From planning, scheduling, prepping, and deciding, it was all new to us. Sweeten and our contractors made us feel at ease,” he continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation had its challenges (the couple moved into a sublet for three months), but it wrapped up beautifully. “Before, there was a daily struggle for space and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>. Getting a certain level of cleanliness was never attainable in an older apartment. Now when we walk in the door, it’s a breath of fresh air,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The countertops are actually marble-like quartz that doesn’t just look pretty; it’s very durable too!</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">A country vibe in the Westchester County suburbs</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">“This unbelievable property felt like it was in the country, rather than the suburbs,” Shana Sandberg of <a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revel Craft and Design</a> said. The 1953 estate, comprising of 1.3 acres in Westchester County&#8217;s Harrison, NY, had a pastoral feel. When the current owners purchased the derelict foreclosure, the house was 5,900 square feet of interior space with seven bedrooms. But the home’s interior had no large meeting space—not a great room nor a dining hall. The existing hang-out spots were a small living room, a cramped kitchen, and a basement den.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The house’s owners, part of a large extended family that had long enjoyed summers together, had grown out of their previous five-bedroom home. Wanting to turn this new, bigger house into their happy place, they hired the Revel team. Shana’s firm found the property and helped guide the family through its purchase. The next challenge was to create and carry out their transformational Westchester County home remodel.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Gathering spots for the family</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">At the top of the To-Do list was to make a place, or places, for the </span><span class="s10">family to gather.</span><span class="s9"> Shana posted the renovation on Sweeten and assisted the homeowners in hiring a contractor who would help bring her vision for the home and property to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, Shana recalled, the existing dining room couldn’t accommodate her clients’ dining table. The kitchen was so poorly designed, it cut off the first floor’s flow. Finishes throughout the home were dated or in bad shape. The property’s outside spaces also had issues. “The outdoor space felt cut off from the land around it,” Shana said. She set out to transform this old home into the ultimate multi-generation compound. The house would have its very first whole-family gathering room along with an inviting chain of indoor and outdoor places and spaces.</span><b></b></p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">An addition with an outside view</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s9">The property’s overhaul was truly a vision in motion. The new house was a dream with its seven sleeping rooms, each of which needed only light renovation, but its kitchen and bathrooms needed total redos. Creating common rooms would require additional square footage. “It was clear where a new family room would go,” Shana said, and how a 750-square-foot addition could make the house function better. She also wanted to enhance the owners’ connection with the property and natural surroundings. “It was easy to see,” Shana added, “decks and pools as the new gathering spaces.”</span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span class="s9" style="color: #000000;">The vision for all areas was to engage with the outdoors. “The addition was planned so it did not disturb a huge, gorgeous oak tree,” Shana explained; the family room extension pushes into the backyard, and windows on three sides provide 180-degree views. The plan also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added a screened-in porch and a deck</a>.</span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">A facelift for the house’s interior</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Inside the house, the remodel changes were just as transformational. Terracotta tile floors were replaced with smooth, warm white-oak flooring. Carrara-looking porcelain tile was chosen to bring a timeless feel to the family’s bathrooms. “For the main-floor powder bathroom,” Shana said, “we’ve had some fun with a surprise moment of a wallcovering called Sumatra.”</span><b></b></p>

<p><span class="s9">Throughout the home, Shana put an emphasis on functionality and took every opportunity to incorporate storage. “We actually made the kitchen and an adjacent bathroom smaller,” she said, revising the layouts and carving out hidden storage, including a pantry, hall closet, and much-needed laundry room cabinetry. “In the new family room, we integrated a built-in bench to hide toys and blankets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">Shana had eyes on everything down to the little details, playing many roles over the course of this renovation. “We were excited to wear most of the hats in this project, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from planning to architecture, to interiors</a> and landscape,” she said. The renovation touched more than 8,000 square feet. The final square footage totaled 8,176 square feet of interior space and 3,000 exterior square feet. Working with their Sweeten contractor, Revel completed it in a year.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">Making the most of a rocky situation</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">For the main exterior space, the goal of communing with nature was similar. “We designed cascading decks,” Shana explained, describing &#8220;hoppable&#8221; platforms that are large, inviting steps into the landscape. Minimal steel cable railings guided walkers downward.</span></p>
<p><span class="s9"><img decoding="async" title="wood-deck-with-cable-rails" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-12.jpg" alt="wood deck with wood framed cable rails and vinyl siding and access to sunroom after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51211" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s9"><img decoding="async" title="sunroom-with-vinyl-ceiling-wood-floors" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-11.jpg" alt="sunroom with wood floors and recessed lights fan and vinyl ceiling with access to deck after renovation" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51210" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-11-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s9">The project was complicated, and the team geared up for unexpected issues. “We hit a doozy when we found that the property is mostly built on ledge or rock. The grade was too high, causing termite issues and more,” Shana said. Much of the property required regrading and excavation for the pool involved weeks of chipping. “We were prepared for it budget-wise, but it delayed us,” she said.</span></p>
<h3><b></b><span class="s9">An outdoor family playground finally emerges</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">Shana extended a stone retaining wall by nearly 40 feet in making a surround for the new pool, and created a planting bed between the pool and the wall. “Now, from the decks as well as the family room, you look onto a wildflower garden that surprises with new blooms throughout spring, summer, and fall,” she explained. Instead of putting a traditional fence around the pool, the Revel team designed a bucolic log enclosure including almost transparent safety mesh. </span></p>

<h3><span class="s9">Teamwork in action</span></h3>
<p><span class="s9">From beginning to end, Shana “drove the concept of creating this feeling of being out in the country</span><span class="s9">, with a palette and layout for both the interior and exteriors.” The Sweeten contractor, she said, was paramount to the project’s success. “The contractors truly felt like our partners,” she said, citing strong daily communication and accounting transparency. “They put us first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="s9">Sweeten supported the process. “They checked in during the project to make sure we were getting what we needed from our contractors, and on how the project was coming along,” Shana said.</span></p>

<p><span class="s9">The end result? An easy-access forever family home that feels far from the fray. And construction challenges that have completely faded into the woodwork thanks to good partner in her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a>. “Renovation combined with new construction is a game of planning, patience, and pivoting,” Shana says. “So much can and will go wrong. Knowing how to pivot can turn a bad circumstance into a great solution.” This family haven is living, breathing proof of it.</span></p>

			<h2>Modern kitchen backsplash ideas with budget, maintenance, and functionality in mind</h2>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg" alt="green subway backsplash tile in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-43493 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DeannaDaria-kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />How to get started on your modern kitchen backsplash ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">You’ve decided to renovate your cookspace. Where should you begin? There are plenty of factors to consider, from the scope of the project to how you want the backsplash to function. You&#8217;ll also decide on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professionals who will guide you</a> and handle the measuring and installation. Sweeten breaks down the elements, whether you&#8217;re considering budget ideas or feature walls.</p>
<p>It’s important to go into your project with a general idea of what your needs are. Is there a heavy emphasis on the budget? Do you want an extremely durable material or have ongoing maintenance concerns on your mind? Are you curious what goes into a more complex backsplash project?

<h3 class="p1">What is the budget for the backsplash material?</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether you’re looking to keep material costs low or don’t mind spending a little extra, here are a few options for each of these considerations.</p>
<h4>Ceramic tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">Ceramic tile comes in a variety of shapes and colors, making it a good place to start your material search. On the lower end of the budget spectrum, you may want to consider a subway tile backsplash. Ceramic subway tile, known for being both affordable and classic, comes in around $3 a square foot. Classic doesn’t have to be boring, though. Consider arranging bright white tiles in a different pattern, such as herringbone, to change the aesthetic of the entire room.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="banquette kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44346" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn + Jon&#8217;s chevron pattern</a></p>
<h4>Porcelain tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">A close second in the low-to-mid range budget area is porcelain tile. Coming in at around $3–$5 a square foot, porcelain is stain and water-resistant, but is very fragile during installation. Similar to ceramic, porcelain comes in a large variety of different sizes, colors, and shapes. If you decide on porcelain tile, be sure to hire a professional with experience in working with this delicate material.</p>
<h4>Brick kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">In the mid-range cost per square foot, brick veneer can bring a warm and inviting feel to your kitchen. Coming in at around $9 a square foot, this material gives your kitchen a unique backdrop reminiscent of a cozy coffee shop.</p>
<h4>Marble tile kitchen backsplash</h4>
<p class="p1">If you have a larger budget, you could consider using a natural stone such as marble. Marble is a beautiful material to use for a kitchen backsplash, creating a more polished look and feel. This higher-end material will cost you somewhere between $25–$30 a square foot. Bear in mind that because marble slabs or tile and natural stone are generally more porous than other materials, this could mean more maintenance in the long run.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Most durable materials</h3>
<p class="p1">Metal tiles are a unique and durable option for a working kitchen. The surface is easily cleaned and resistant to most kitchen messes, like water and food splash-back. Metal may be a good option if you want something low-maintenance without sacrificing your sense of style.</p>
<p class="p1">If you love the look of natural stone, but worry about the durability, consider using granite. Granite is an extremely resistant natural stone often used in countertops but also works well as a stone backsplash material. It is easy to clean and only requires occasional maintenance such as re-sealing and polishing. It’s a great <span class="s1">durable</span> option for a natural stone look that you could even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinate to match your countertops</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Low-maintenance backsplash ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">In a kitchen with a lot of daily usage and traffic, consider a backsplash material that is resistant against things such as food stains, heat, or water. Glass tile is modern, easy to clean, and non-porous, and at around $7 a square foot, really affordable. The peel-and-stick variety is also very common, which generally means you can find it at a good price. Glass tile is low maintenance and does not require anything special to clean. It’s a great backsplash option for busy people who don’t have the time to do a lot of deep cleaning.</p>
<p class="p1">Another low-maintenance backsplash option is slabs of stone such as quartz. Stone slabs have fewer seams, and thus, less grout to keep clean. Quartz slabs are particularly popular because they give a marble-style aesthetic for less than the cost of actual marble. If quartz isn’t your thing, consider other slab backsplash options like soapstone or solid-surface.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are interested in a stone slab backsplash like quartz, expect to pay somewhere in the range of $65-$80 a square foot.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Tip:</strong> To cut down on expenses during a kitchen remodel, utilize leftover slab pieces from your countertop replacement for your backsplash.</p>
<h3>Modern kitchen backsplash ideas make a statement</h3>
<p class="p1">This vertical surface is the centerpiece of your kitchen; why not make it a feature wall? Consider a detailed ceramic-tile backsplash using one to two-inch tiles. The tiles are small enough to arrange in several different designs, and you can use alternating colors and shapes to create a piece of art right in your kitchen.</p>
<p class="p1">Natural stone can also be used to create a mosaic-style backsplash. Use different-sized pieces and combine them to fit naturally against each other.</p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="backsplash kitchen tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47119" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners&#8217; Nilda + Brian&#8217;s renovation</p>
<p class="p1">Adding a patterned tile or mosaic-style kitchen backsplash will increase your labor costs, so you should take into consideration an additional $17–$20 per square foot. More complex designs will cost more in labor due to the intricacies of laying the tile.<span class="s1"> </span>To save some money in labor costs, you could opt to create a small section of tile artistry. Consider a square cut-out with different colored tiles in the middle of your regular backsplash tiles.<span class="s1"> This could be placed in a focal-point area above your stove or sink, depending on the layout of your kitchen. </span>You could also decide to lay rectangular tiles in a linear style, which will typically cost less in installation because it is generally less time-consuming.</p>
<h3>Ordering the right quantity</h3>
<p class="p1">When purchasing the materials for a piece of intricate backsplash art, large or small, measurements become crucial. Have a design plan for the area in the form of a sketch or inspiration picture, and measure everything as accurately as possible. This can get complicated quickly, so it’s best to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">ask your general contractor</span></a> for guidance rather than undertaking an intensive project by yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Kitchen backsplash material considerations take time and careful planning. Know what your budget is and what materials work best for your lifestyle. It is the first place to start towards your dream cook space.</p>

			<h2><strong>These classic Colonial kitchen renovations show interiors ready for modern-day life</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45098" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) The 1919 Colonial of Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda and Cory</a></span></span></p>
<p>The quaintness of Colonial-style homes is undeniable. Usually marked by two or three stories and brick or wood facades, these dwellings are traditionally found on the east coast. They are typically characterized by a simple almost minimalist shape. The floor plan keeps the kitchen and dining room on the first floor with bedrooms on the second. And while some have open-concept layouts, it is more common to see separation between rooms. They are also easy to remodel by adding on to the side or back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at three Colonial kitchen renovations by Sweeten—examples of their older interiors redone to bring in modern style and conveniences.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bringing a Tudor Colonial into the next century</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="blue gray kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34775" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Built in 1912, </span>Nilda and Brian’s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tudor Colonial in Westchester County, NY, desperately needed a remodel. The 4,400-square-foot home featured a kitchen that was last updated almost 60 years ago. It was time for a change. “The floor was three inches off-level,” says Nilda. “You could peek through the floor to the basement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="backyard entry" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34776" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The couple hired a Sweeten contractor for the remodel. To honor the historic style, they maintained some separation between the kitchen and the other living spaces. New cabinets, flooring, and lighting updated the look. They also opened up the back wall to install a patio door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They kept a traditional feel by opting for Shaker cabinets in a modern gray color. The butler’s pantry also keeps the turn-of-the-century vibe but with a contemporary twist.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Colonial Revival home gets rejuvenated</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44333" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Fiske Terrace, Brooklyn, is a quiet enclave built at the turn of the 20th century. Interestingly, the Flatbush neighborhood is filled with Colonial Revival homes. So when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nydia and Jonathan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought their 3,240-square-foot home in 2012, they decided to renovate. But at the time, they put off the larger renovation of the outdated kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, renovation, remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37425" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Eventually, they turned to Sweeten to find the right contractor for their old-home renovation. They wanted to take advantage of the natural light the house afforded. However, like in many other Colonial home renovations, the small windows blocked out the light. As a solution, they replaced them with white-framed ones. In addition, they updated the kitchen with gray-blue cabinets and brushed gold accents. These design choices make the aesthetic modern yet still warm and inviting. The bonus? The exposed brick from the chimney area brings even more character.</span></p>
<h3><strong>From challenged to Colonial charming </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dated salmon-colored Formica didn’t stop </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda and Cory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from buying their 1919 Colonial home. For a while, they actually found it charming. However, they knew eventually it needed to be renovated. They hired a Sweeten contractor to update the kitchen to accommodate their family’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On their list of goals was creating a better flow of traffic and light. A challenge of renovating Colonial homes is their notorious separation of rooms. The main entrance to the kitchen by way of the dining room was too narrow. As a result, it isolated the kitchen. But taking down the wall felt disrespectful to the house’s character, so instead, they simply widened and centered it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="old house kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a lot of Colonials, there was some asymmetry in the house. One example was the sheetrock box-beam in the kitchen. They assumed it encased something hard to move, so they left it. However, they fixed the problem by giving it a matching beam which created symmetry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new space makes us feel happy,” says Amanda. “It feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.”</span></p>

<p class="p1">Statistically speaking, kitchens are the most remodeled room in a home. This is due to many factors, not the least of which is that few things date a home faster than a kitchen design. Kitchens tend to last a long time. Whether this is your forever home or you plan to move in a few years, you can choose to personalize your kitchen or give it a classic design. Below, Sweeten outlines how to start a kitchen remodel and how the pros put everything back together.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3">How to start a kitchen remodel: Gather information</h3>
<p class="p1">To answer that question, you’ll need to answer a few others first. Here are a few:</p>
<h4>Are you DIY-ing your kitchen?</h4>
<p class="p1">To answer the first question, consider not just the money you’ll need, but the time as well. For example, you may have the skills to do some or all of the work yourself. Many homeowners will perform fairly low-skill projects, such as painting and caulking to save money. More experienced do-it-yourselfers can also install trim, insulation, and even floor coverings. However, these projects will take a while, so make sure you have the time to complete them. (We recommend reading about <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/the-cons-of-diy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cons of DIY in home renovation.</a>)</p>
<p class="p1">A very common mistake of first-time remodelers is underestimating the time needed to finish a renovation. If you plan to do some of the work yourself, make sure you can complete the project in a timely manner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> For example, i</span>f you hire contractors, you don’t want to delay them because you didn&#8217;t finish your project in a weekend.</p>
<h4>How will you communicate with contractors?</h4>
<p>If you plan to use contractors, will you be available to answer questions during the day? A good solution is to set up a window of time for communication. For example, make yourself available for a couple of hours each morning to discuss the events of the following day. That way your contractor can meet with you once, instead of playing phone tag throughout the day.</p>
<h4>What part of your kitchen remodel is the most important?</h4>
<p class="p1">This question is probably the most important because it really doesn’t matter how much your project costs, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how long it takes</a> if you don&#8217;t like the end result. For instance, in a kitchen remodel, you’ll likely spend most of your budget on the cabinets and the countertops. (Note: this excludes appliances if you plan to replace those as well). Cabinets and counters are typically the first things you see when you enter a kitchen, so most owners want to make a good impression. Know what you care about the most and make sure it&#8217;s covered in your budget.</p>
<h5>&#8220;Must-haves&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Nice-to-haves&#8221;</h5>
<p class="p1">A great way to stay on track and keep your costs under control is to make two lists. The first should list all of the renovation “must-haves” that are the most important to you. These items are non-negotiable and must be included. The second list will include any “nice-to-have” features. These are things you would like to include if you have the resources available, but not at the expense of your &#8220;must-have&#8221; list.</p>
<h4>Why are you remodeling your kitchen?</h4>
<p class="p1">Lastly, ask yourself why you want to remodel the space. It may seem like a silly question, but one thing many homeowners fear is over-remodeling. To illustrate, if you plan to live in a home forever, buying exotic wood cabinets or installing customized materials can be very satisfying. However, if you plan to sell the home for a profit in the near future, installing those features could actually lower your home’s value by comparison if few other comparable homes have them as well. A potential buyer may be able to afford your neighborhood, but not share your same taste. They may place very little value on your personalized choice, which affects your return on investment.</p>
<p class="p1">Avoid this scenario by deciding upfront what your end goal is and act accordingly. There is nothing wrong with personalizing your home, but it may be useful to know in advance which features will have a good return on the investment and which will not. Asking this one question will often save renovating homeowners thousands of dollars.</p>
<h3 class="p3">What happens if you&#8217;re gutting a kitchen?</h3>
<p class="p1">Generally speaking, in a gut remodel, everything will be removed down to the wall studs. This allows for inspection of the wall cavities and the installation of any fixtures, like a pot filler, while all of the pipes are still accessible. Any new features, such as a window, are also framed at this stage.</p>
<p class="p1">Renovations can also be done in phases. For example, it is often convenient to replace light fixtures or add ceiling-mounted speakers before removing cabinets and flooring. As we tend to need our kitchens during a renovation, performing the project in phases can be a welcome option.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Remodel Your Kitchen In the Correct Order and Save Money</h3>
<h4>Staying code compliant</h4>
<p class="p1">So now that you have an empty room, what do you do? After gaining access to the wall studs, any insulation, framing, electrical, or plumbing work can be done. If your project will be built in a jurisdiction with code requirements, there will usually be an inspection made by a local codes official to ensure compliance. Any required inspections will need to be made and passed before installing new drywall. An experienced and licensed general contractor will know the code requirements for your municipality and will be responsible for adhering to them. After any new features are installed, inspected, and approved the drywall is then replaced and finished.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Paint and lighting</h4>
<p class="p1">In many situations, the next step is to paint. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the pros will usually spray on paint, because it is super fast when the room is empty. This prevents the need to stand on a step ladder for hours on end painting around light fixtures and wall switches, saving you money.</p>
<p class="p1">Professionals will often install the light fixtures next. Again, this may seem odd, but wall sconces and overhead fixtures need to be in an open space to distribute the light, keeping them out of the way of other projects. Contractors often work in low lighting, because during the beginning phase the space is essentially bare. By installing the lighting first, the need for pole lights and other portable lighting is reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that the kitchen is painted and well lit, the cabinets are usually installed, followed by the countertops, and finally, the sink. As mentioned earlier, you may also be adding new plumbing fixtures such as a bar sink, or pot filler. These would be installed at this stage, as well as new features such as GFCI outlets or a hot water recirculation pump.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Lay flooring down last</h4>
<p class="p1">Floor covering such as vinyl or cork can be damaged easily during a remodel. Even <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/qa-with-joy-moyler-design-tips-on-trends-and-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">durable materials such as porcelain tiles</a> can be broken by a falling tool. Hardwood floors are especially vulnerable, as repairs often involve removing large sections. For this reason, professionals will usually install floor coverings last. This also prevents wasting materials in areas that will never be walked on, such as under cabinetry. At this stage, any trim required, such as the baseboard or casing can be replaced.</p>
<h3>Ready to get started?</h3>
<p class="p1">Remodeling a kitchen can be the most rewarding project a homeowner can take on. It&#8217;ll likely pay off with prospective buyers, too, since the kitchen is often considered the most important room in a home. Knowing how to start a kitchen remodel can be simple if you&#8217;re prepared with the right details. Remember to do your homework, ask your contractor lots of questions, and stay involved in the process.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date NYC</span><span class="s2"> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagining your dream kitchen is easy; budgeting for it is complicated. If you&#8217;re planning a kitchen remodel, we&#8217;ll help you understand your options, and offer guidance on major expenses and hidden costs you may encounter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From building requirements to permits and design, here are the average kitchen renovation costs to expect in NYC. These figures are broken out by finish level, and are based on Sweeten renovations: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$25,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$35,000</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovation costs: Starting at <b>$65,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Start planning your kitchen renovation now. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a backlog in the supply of many construction materials and fixtures. For homeowners interested in remodeling, it’s smart to quickly sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. We also advise locking in a start date on the contractor’s calendar. Waiting could lead to longer delays, and even more severe price inflation on materials.</span> <em><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—at no cost to you.</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-for-renovation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png" alt="Cost estimate for renovation" width="1080" height="380" class="alignnone wp-image-51060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01-300x106.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-01-600x211.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></span></h3>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">From budget to high-end kitchen appliances and finishes </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Appliances, fixtures, and finishing materials all lie on a spectrum, whether you&#8217;re doing a budget kitchen remodel or a high-end one. Your choice of quality level (often called &#8220;finish level&#8221;) is a major factor in the cost of a kitchen renovation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Budget” kitchen materials are generally off-the-shelf items from “big box” stores or IKEA. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Mid-grade” kitchen materials balance cost with quality. Examples include engineered wood flooring and products from GE, Caesarstone, Kohler, or Benjamin Moore. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“High-end” kitchen materials prioritize quality over cost. Products include hardwood flooring or marble, and brands like Bertazzoni, Ann Sacks, and Farrow &amp; Ball. This category may also include special materials sourced from overseas suppliers, and fully custom fabrications.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png"><img decoding="async" title="breakup-of-renovation-cost" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png" alt="Breakup of cost" width="1080" height="1080" class="alignnone wp-image-51061 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-300x300.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-150x150.png 150w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-02-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></span></h3>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">How much do materials for a kitchen renovation cost?</span></h3>
<p><strong>Cabinets</strong>   budget: $130/linear foot (LF)  |  mid-grade: $1000/LF |  high-end: $2000/LF <strong>Appliances</strong>  budget: $2,500  |  mid-grade: $5000  |  high-end: $17,000–$26,000 <strong>Vent hood</strong>  budget: $200  |  mid-grade: $500  |  high-end: $5,000+ <strong>Countertops</strong>  budget: $5/sqft  |  mid-grade: $50/sqft |  high-end: $100/sqft <strong>Backsplash</strong>  budget: $3/sqft  |  mid-grade: $15/sqft  |  high-end: $35/sqft <strong>Flooring (tile)</strong>  budget: $3/sqft  |  mid-grade: $15/sqft |  high-end: $35/sqft <strong>Sink</strong>  budget: $150  |  mid-grade: $500  |  high-end: $2000+ <strong>Cabinet hardware</strong>  budget: $5/piece  |  mid-grade: $30/piece |  high-end: $300/piece <strong>Lighting</strong>  budget: $50/piece  |  mid-grade: $200/piece |  high-end: $500/piece</p>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A note about cabinetry: In high-end kitchens that feature custom millwork, the cabinetry often accounts for a high percentage of both materials and labor costs. The starting point for basic custom cabinetry is <b>$1,000</b> per linear foot. There are many other factors—drawers are costlier than shelves, and features such as Lazy Susans, pull-out pantries, specialized compartments, and soft-close hinges all increase costs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Custom cabinets are not just for large houses; apartment owners with limited kitchen depth may benefit even more by going custom. Shallower cabinets can fit tighter spaces, while deeper cabinets can hold larger dinner plates and platters. You may also have an odd-shaped space or awkward corner that you&#8217;d like to accommodate with a cabinet, to maximize a small kitchen&#8217;s storage. Choices like these require custom work, because prefabricated cabinets offer fewer options. Read more about the difference between <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">custom and prefab cabinets here</span></a>.</span></p>

<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Kitchen renovation costs for permits, design, and behind-the-scenes items</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The average kitchen remodel costs are comprised of both visible and invisible items. Here are the &#8220;invisible&#8221; behind-the-scenes budget items to keep on your radar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s1">Building requirements</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Building boards / HOAs can play a significant role in dictating design and budget needs for apartment owners. These requirements can range from insurance coverage minimums, which limit your ability to work with professionals who aren’t carrying high-value insurance policies, to alteration agreements that require anyone doing any work in the building to have far-reaching coverage for problems they may never encounter, like asbestos removal or collapse scenarios.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contractors who can afford to work in buildings with more extensive requirements tend to have higher operating costs and can meet higher insurance requirements, more stringent debris removal expectations, limited noise and hours-of-work requirements, and stricter parking rules. While there is no exact figure on this, you may see this translate into higher rates overall for teams that can meet those demands.</span></p>
<h4>City permits</h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing services:<b> $2,000 –</b> <b>$3,500. </b> Possibly higher, if you have more than the usual number of plumbing fixtures. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Plumbing permits: <b>$2,000 –</b> <b>$5,000 </b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Electrical permits: <b>$900</b> </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Asbestos inspection: <b>$500</b> – <b>$1,000</b> </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The City’s Department of Buildings requires a permit for any plumbing work that exceeds a minor repair or a direct swap of a similar fixture. Adding outlets or electrical circuits will require an electrical permit. You may also need an asbestos inspection, depending on your building’s requirements and any work that requires opening the walls.</span></p>
<h4>Design costs for kitchen renovation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the design stage, you&#8217;ll collaborate with the professionals you hire, who will create detailed drawings for all the tradespeople to follow. The design will cover details of the room footprint, plumbing, cabinetry, counters, sinks, backsplashes, flooring, lighting, hardware, and appliances. Kitchen renovation design costs will depend on the scope, and also who you hire. In some cases, your Sweeten general contractor will have design experience and will be able to make recommendations and draw up basic plans. For a higher level of service, some general contractors operate full-service design/build firms, with dedicated designers on staff. Some contracting firms also have architects on staff; many can refer an architect. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">If you are considering major layout changes, such as removing walls, rerouting gas or plumbing lines, and rewiring electrical, you are looking at spending at least <b>$32,000</b> for a basic kitchen gut. If you are considering this kind of transformative work, you’ll need architectural designs from a registered architect and to plan for the cost of permits, building approvals, high insurance coverage requirements, and more involved oversight from your general contractor. </span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">These “soft costs”—expenses critical to the success of the work but often invisible or unforeseen—can represent 15 to 20% of the total cost of a kitchen renovation.

<h4><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png"><img decoding="async" title="cost-estimate-of-demolition-and-site-preparation" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png" alt="Cost estimate of demolition and site preparation" width="1080" height="551" class="alignnone wp-image-51063 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04.png 1080w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-300x153.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NYC-Kitchen-Cost-Guides-Info-04-600x306.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Demolition and site prep</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the site prep stage, your general contractor needs to do significant work behind the scenes to ensure that your kitchen renovation maintains its value over time. Old materials and fixtures need to be pulled out and disposed of—this can be complicated on busy city streets with limited parking. Your contractor will probably need to strip the walls and flooring in order to frame and level the room. This step is labor-intensive, typically costing around<b> $4,000</b>. Other site prep includes protecting surfaces and valuables outside the renovation area, fixing any problems discovered within the walls, and adding insulation or waterproofing.</span></p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the main event. High-quality materials are only as good as the installation—if hinges are not properly aligned on drawers or cabinets, or if the shelving is not completely level, these faults can make the work look shoddy, can make your kitchen harder to use, and can lead to your expensive fixtures aging poorly. Appliances are often installed by the store where you made the purchase (as a built-in cost or an added delivery/installation fee), while countertop suppliers often also manage installation. If installation costs aren&#8217;t included in an item&#8217;s purchase price, they&#8217;ll typically fall under the “general construction” or “labor” budget and be handled by your general contractor.</span></p>
<h3>Behind-the-scenes kitchen renovation costs</h3>
<h4>Overhead costs</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">General contractors always factor in a percentage of the project to cover overhead costs, including insurances, administrative support, and the inevitable costs of growing a business. Sweeten contractors range from two-person crews to firms employing dozens of professionals (including designers, project managers, millworkers, laborers, bookkeepers, and operations staff). No matter the size of your contractor’s business, you will absorb some of the cost increases they bear from year to year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s6">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span></a><span class="s1"> explained that as a business grows, costs also go up. “Insurances increase yearly, and anything related to MEPs (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) has also increased a bit as these subcontractors—especially plumbers—have seen an increase in their costs.” This is because the rules have become more stringent and there needs to be “more eyes on the project.” Additionally, he mentions, “Buildings are being more stringent on their [insurance] requirements which cause us to keep up with those needs.”</span></p>
<h4>Raw material costs</h4>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, the industry is affected by global trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 2021, Sweeten general contractors are seeing wood materials as the main increase in costs. &#8220;These material costs have increased approximately 3x the amounts mainly due to Covid related issues, from what we have seen,&#8221; said <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Thomas</span>. &#8220;These, in turn, relate to higher costs for plywood subfloors, kitchen cabinets, and other woodwork-related projects.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen renovations in NYC</h3>
<h4>How long does a kitchen remodel take?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months, depending on the complexity of your project. Will you be altering the room’s footprint? Changing or adding electric wiring, plumbing, or gas lines? Ordering custom cabinetry or millwork? Each of these options will add significant time. You may also encounter delays with the city’s permitting process, or with permission from your building’s board. </span></p>
<h4>Do you need a permit to remodel a kitchen?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ll be changing the kitchen’s footprint, making changes to wiring, gas lines, or plumbing, or removing asbestos, you’ll need the appropriate permits from the city. If you live in an apartment building, you’ll almost certainly need approval from the building’s board for any construction work. Discuss with your Sweeten general contractor if they’ll assist with the permit process which is typically 10% of the budget. </span></p>
<h4>How do I remodel a kitchen on a budget?</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to make a clear, prioritized list of must-haves and nice-to-haves.

Explore scaling back the biggest budget items: footprint changes, changes to wiring/plumbing/gas, custom cabinetry, and millwork, high-end appliances. Your Sweeten general contractor may help find creative solutions—like Ikea cabinets with a similar look to the custom ones you were considering, or ways to accomplish your goals without moving walls. Sweeten recommends setting aside a 10% contingency budget, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about unwelcome surprises.</span> Ready to budget for your NYC kitchen renovation costs?

			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>

<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>

<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

<p>Homeowners have a personal style that they express through their designs. Kitchen cabinetry uses a good percentage of an overall renovation budget. So, how do you stay true to your design aesthetic without breaking the bank? One way is to opt for the look of custom cabinets without actually ordering custom.

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Tina + Andrew&#8217;s kitchen</p>
<p>Tina loved her charming 1930s prewar building she grew up in. So when a two-bedroom co-op became available, she and her husband, Andrew, jumped at the chance. It <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">needed to be renovated</a> but that didn&#8217;t stop them. They posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and hired a general contractor to update their kitchen.</p>
<p>The couple needed to stay on budget, so they looked into Semihandmade cabinet doors. <span style="color: #333333;">&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e tried to be clever and save where we could,&#8221; says Tina. &#8220;Instead of custom cabinets, we went with Ikea but purchased the cabinet doors from a company that specializes in stylish and modern cabinetry for Ikea kitchen systems.”  They chose a beautiful super matte shaker cabinet in white and light gray. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Semihandmade doors are simple to screw on and off, so if down the road you want a totally different look, you can easily change out the doors instead of tearing out your kitchen all over again!</span></span></p>

<h3>When the budget is the top priority</h3>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) A Queens kitchen in a rich neutral</span></p>
<p>Like many homeowners who renovate, this couple&#8217;s biggest concern was budget. After renting for years, they had saved up to buy their own place, a two-bedroom, two-bath in Flushing. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-flushing-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided updating the kitchen</a> would be the most dramatic change. They chose a mix of neutrals and opted for Semihandmade cabinet doors with Ikea bases. This allowed the couple to get a customized look for a fraction of what fully custom cabinets cost. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is much more open and inviting,&#8221; says one of the homeowners. &#8220;I’ve never been one to hang out in the kitchen, but now I want to spend more time here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: <span style="color: #333333;">Semihandmade doors come in 45 different colors and styles, but the doors are also available unpainted so you can unleash your DIY spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Dan + Mike&#8217;s kitchen open shelving storage</span></p>
<p>Dan and Mike&#8217;s one-bedroom, one-bath co-op was in desperate <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need of a kitchen renovation</a>. To achieve their desired aesthetic, it would require removing a wall, gutting the entire kitchen, and extending the counters and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cabinetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Removing the wall had a major impact on the look as did taking down the upper cabinets and replacing them with open floating shelves. The shelves were sourced from a shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that specializes in salvage pieces. For the lower cabinets, they installed Ikea cabinets with <a href="https://www.semihandmade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semihandmade</a> doors and hardware. Floating shelves can make up for storage lost in the removal of upper cabinets.</p>
<p><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Lower shelves are perfect for easy-to-grab cooking essentials like cutting boards, spices, and cookbooks. <span style="color: #333333;">Higher shelves tend to be more decorative. It’s the mix of objects and textures that makes floating shelves a standout in any kitchen.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Jennifer + Alex&#8217;s two-toned kitchen</span></p>
<p>When Jennifer and Alex Figueroa bought their beach house in East Hampton, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they wanted to renovate it</a> in order to meet their family&#8217;s needs. They have two young boys, so they wanted a space where they could run and play freely. This meant opening up the choppy layout and gutting the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e felt excited about this part of the project,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;We splurged on a wine fridge, quartz countertops, and an integrated refrigerator but otherwise kept the open kitchen fairly simple.&#8221; This &#8220;fairly simple&#8221; design included their contractor customizing Ikea cabinets with walnut panel doors for a two-toned look. He also added paneling on the ceiling for a luxe look. This took the 1970s home into the new millennium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Two-toned looks work well when complementary styles and colors are used for the upper and lower cabinets. Another popular trend right now is a pop of color for the kitchen island, paired with base cabinets that are more neutral.  </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Marc + Steve&#8217;s kitchen</span></p>
<p>After seven months of living in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home,</a> Marc and Steve decided it was time to take the plunge and renovate. &#8220;The kitchen <span style="font-weight: 400;">was perhaps the most outdated room,&#8221; says Marc. The existing cabinets were grimy and the doors were falling off the hinges. They wouldn&#8217;t be able to measure for new cabinets before work began. Marc and Steve decided to use Ikea cabinets with Semihandmade doors in order to get the cabinets quicker (custom cabinets have longer lead times.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To streamline the look of the kitchen, they chose flat-panel doors rather than the popular shaker style. They needed to order cabinets of varying sizes so this choice helped to unify the space. </span>“Design-wise, it’s the kitchen we always wanted and I don’t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices),&#8221; said Marc.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tip from Beth</strong>: Since we make our door fronts to order, the time it takes from payment to delivery depends on the materials purchased. C<span style="color: #333333;">urrently, the average lead time is 3-6 weeks.</span></span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short counter<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No matter the size of your home, there’s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space. Keep in mind the kitchen activities that are important to your lifestyle, plot the best layout and flow, and get ready for your dream cook space.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">L-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to find space for counter eating</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>

<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>These kitchen pantry designs are just one aspect of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a kitchen designed for stress-free cooking and entertaining</a>.</p>

<h3>Renovation plan: living in the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To say I won the real estate lottery might feel like an overstatement, but after a short hunt, I found a Brooklyn Heights co-op in a 1920s building. It had everything I had been looking for—two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting in new hardwood floors</a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question—and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn’t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn’t exactly scream a clear solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.</p>

<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, “brilliant” plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an island, then a peninsula</a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn’t) working for the kitchen.</p>

<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the “entry,” but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a drop ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.</p>

<h3>Two prep zones</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and keep it close to the cooktop/oven. By doing this, I <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created two zones for prep</a> on each side of the sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop/oven, and the refrigerator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.</p>

<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the way my apartment “boundaries” were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design, there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and “open” storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a “piano” finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I’m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.</p>

<h3>Consider all possibilities</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I optimistically planned for a “quick” two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor’s work.</p>
<h3>Brighter and more functional home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating my own space as an architect</a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I’m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,  and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they’re coming for dinner.</p>

It can add a point of interest that elevates the design and makes it stand out. But a “pop of color” doesn’t mean the color has to be overly bold. It can be a nicely balanced rich hue that helps define the look of the space. Here, we share examples of Sweeten renovators who added color to kitchens and turned up the overall design of their homes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Blue kitchens for the win</h3>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The use of the color blue has seen an uptick in use in the last few years. As seen in these Sweeten renovations, the shade, placement, and amount of blue may vary, but each project uses the hue to its fullest potential. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s renovation</a> of their Park Slope apartment included a kitchen and bath remodel but it&#8217;s the kitchen where they made the most dramatic choice. They used Lucerne from Benjamin Moore to give style to their entire kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Conversely, Sweeten renovator <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnish</a> wanted his kitchen to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more neutral for resale purposes</a> but still wanted to add some personality. He did so by putting in white upper and base cabinets but using blue (almost black) cabinets in the peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten homeowners wanted a &#8220;classic [kitchen] with flair.&#8221; To achieve this, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracey and Brian</a> incorporated blue when redoing their kitchen—a project that they had dreamed about since they moved into their Pelham Manor home 14 years ago. Blue is Tracey&#8217;s favorite color, so like Laura and Walter, they found a color from Benjamin Moore they liked. However, they were pleasantly surprised when they realized Omega had cabinets in almost that exact shade, eliminating the need for a custom paint color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A long-distance relationship would soon culminate into living together in a 1915 co-op for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim and Ian</a>. With Kim in New Jersey and Ian in Australia, they were relieved that shopping for materials could be done online, including the sky blue herringbone backsplash tile.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Going green in the kitchen</h3>
<p>
<img decoding="async" width="600" height="900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="sea green kitchen cabinets with white countertop and sink with steel faucet after renovation" type="single-slider" link="none" columns="1" size="large" ids="44338,45656" orderby="post__in" include="44338,45656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Laura-Kitchen-3.jpg 1705w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
<img decoding="async" width="600" height="900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-600x900.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="emerald green cabinets" type="single-slider" link="none" columns="1" size="large" ids="44338,45656" orderby="post__in" include="44338,45656" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These Sweeten renovators <a href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/cabinets/styles/green-cabinet-colors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to give green a go</a>. When Keren Richter&#8217;s client hired her to design the <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-williamsburg-studio-goes-boutique-hotel-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> in his Brooklyn home, she was happy he was game to think of the box. &#8220;Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie,&#8221; recalled Keren. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Likewise but in a softer hue, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Tim</a> updated their Queens townhouse kitchen in green. The mint green shaker-front cabinets &#8220;match the feel of the old house but are also clean and modern at the same time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For their kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were inspired by their co-op&#8217;s verdant backyard. They wanted to bring the outside in, so they chose a beautiful shade of agave for the lower cabinets. Similarly, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/designer-duo-renovation-kips-bay-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maggie and Adam</a> chose a light green  for their lower cabinets in order to &#8220;add the layer of color that fit their style.”</p>

<h3>A passion for a purple kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-peninsula-custom-cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33020" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with custom cabinets in open purple and white kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-fit-for-the-lights-on-broadway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marissa</a> used Sweeten when remodeling her bathroom a few years ago. So, when she and her husband, Jeremy, were ready to redo their kitchen, they turned to the renovation matchmaker once again. Their Sweeten contractor was able to help them envision the flow and look of the space. To keep the space from feeling washed out with all white cabinets, they added a deep purple on the nearby walls. The result is a stylish yet classic design that will stand the test of time.</p>

<h3>Not-so-mellow yellow cook space</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-quartz- countertop-black cabinets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33847 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="white quartz countertop over black kitchen cabinet and orange moroccan tiles backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David and Dawn&#8217;s kitchen</a> in their Park Slope loft was badly in need of a renovation. The cabinets had seen a lot of wear and tear, and appliances and drawers were not in the best positions. They wanted a kitchen that they could entertain in. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to reconfigure the layout and then turned their sights on the design details. The centerpiece of the entire kitchen is the yellow Moroccan tile backsplash. “It makes us happy every day,” she said. Another delight: the organic feeling of the small details that blend seamlessly into the rest of their home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-island-separator-blue-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48144 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg" alt="white island separator in a kitchen with blue cabinets and white countertop space along with blue wallpaper and open white shelves" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mollie-After-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="light-brick-wall-narrow-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48148 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg" alt="light brick wall in a narrow living room with plush gray and blue furniture and open metal shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>
