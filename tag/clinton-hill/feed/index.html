</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter, </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartment’s finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry résumé); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Dara</em></p>
<h3>Figuring out the best layout for the apartment</h3>
<p>Our building was originally constructed in 1930, possibly for officers of the Navy Yard located several blocks north. Like many buildings in NYC, it turned into a co-op in the &#8217;80s. The overall layout of the apartment was great, with a lot of natural light, but the configuration of the space in both bathrooms, as well as the kitchen, was awkward.</p>
<p>Mauricio, an architect, and I wanted to open up the kitchen so that all four of us, including our 5-year-old twins, could move around it comfortably while adding counter space and enlarging the existing island. But solving that problem was really challenging. We must have gone through at least ten different layouts.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We discussed everything from a standard galley kitchen layout, to relocating the gas line and stove,</span><span class="s2"> but nothing felt quite right. Then we said, &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">hat if we extend the kitchen by taking a bit of space away from the adjacent</span><span class="s2"> dining room?&#8221; Ultimately, we realized that by </span><span class="s1">moving the fridge and aligning it with an enlarged island,</span><span class="s2"> we could seamlessly expand the kitchen </span><span class="s1">without sacrificing room for our dining table</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p>The kitchen remodel worked, and now we have a much bigger kitchen with a lot more storage and prep space. We even have huge cabinets underneath our island. Most importantly, our dining room is still perfectly roomy.</p>

<h3>Renovation tip to help save time</h3>
<p>We planned for minimal construction and maximum impact.  The access point <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the washer and dryer</a> was moved from the master bedroom to the third bedroom by easily rotating it in its existing space, rather than relocating it. That way, you don’t need to walk through the master to do a load of laundry. It also allowed us a larger shower.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We opened up the “den” off the living room</span><span class="s2"> by removing built-ins along three walls </span><span class="s1">to create a more flexible space as a TV room and an office</span><span class="s2">. We saved money and time tailoring modular closets to our needs rather than building out new closets. </span>Non-layout items we needed to address included fixing the electric panel and installing new hardwood floors since the original wood was as thin as the veneer.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, we kept in mind our 3 R&#8217;s mantra: Things needed to be easily <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repairable, replaceable, or recyclable</a>. Most of our purchases were made from local stores that had minimum to no lead time. We chose not to do anything custom until our kids stopped sharing a bedroom when they get older; we might need to rethink some of the spaces.</p>

<h3>Compromising on style</h3>
<p>In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences. I chose a more eclectic style in the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles. In the master bathroom, Mauricio preferred a more streamlined and minimalist look with grays and whites with a floating white glossy vanity.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the kitchen cabinets, we went with Ikea, that we could upgrade to semi-custom later on. We wanted solid hardwood that was reminiscent in the color of the original floor, but more modern looking. We chose a white oak in wide planks.</p>
<h3>A good-working Sweeten reno team</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor and his dad made a great team. He was very easy to talk to, and his dad was quite resourceful, with many solutions for various problems we encountered along the way. We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through. We could debate different ideas with him, but he was never pushy or non-communicative.</p>
<h3>Avoiding subcontractor issues</h3>
<p>One thing we would do differently is to put all of the renovation items (except finishes) under the contractor umbrella. We bought our countertop slabs from a local store, which encouraged us to use their fabricator rather than using our contractor to oversee the subcontractors. At installation, there were problems with sizing and fit. The fabricator blamed the contractor for moving the kitchen cabinets. Meanwhile, the contractor blamed the fabricator for cutting a countertop that didn’t fit. If the fabricator had been a subcontractor of our contractor, and under his supervision, that would have all been avoided.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re extremely happy with our home. After the full renovation of our apartment, all four of us can have breakfast at the kitchen island with room to spare. Plus, with all of the closets plus the kitchen storage, we finally have enough space to store everything. It all makes us happy on a daily basis. <span class="s1">Now we are gearing up for renovating our rooftop, to create an outdoor space for our family that rivals the interior.</span></p>

<h3>Raising children in the city</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone who grew up in a suburban setting gets this but the city has a lot to offer to children. We owned and had for years lived in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom condo in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. Our 1,275-square-foot space was comfortable, but we wanted our girls to experience life as we had—growing up in a family house. Instead of moving to the suburbs, we agreed that we would look at single-family fixer-uppers if it meant we could afford to move back to a favorite neighborhood, Clinton Hill, and do the unthinkable and renovate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a year-and-a-half of searching real estate listings, we found our <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/townhouse-renovation-guide-purchasing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn-of-the-century townhouse</a>. The square footage was less than 2,000, split among three floors, and the building had been divided into a two-family home. We didn’t want to be landlords, so we would convert the space back to its original single-family state. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42921 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-portrait.jpg" alt="family portrait, dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-portrait-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Finding the right townhouse to call home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started by looking at lots of New York City townhome photos on Pinterest, and thinking about how we could replicate the layouts of those we liked. We didn’t want the space to feel choppy, like it was still two apartments. We wanted to reconfigure our first floor, which had been a one-bedroom apartment, as an open-concept living room, dining area, and kitchen. Our contractor was also a design-build firm that would help with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire design transition and execution</a>.</span></p>

<h3>A townhouse remodel allows for a bigger first-floor</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We realized we could create the flow of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-family townhouse</a> by widening the first-floor apartment’s entryway and leaving it open to the hall and stairway. The rooms on this floor would be joined to create our large living and dining space. We needed more space for the kitchen, and found square footage by bumping into the ground-floor bath, removing the bathtub and turning it into a powder room. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42918 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Ceiling-height kitchen cabinets, green backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-3-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Find a modern mid-century aesthetic</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like in most townhouses, the rooms lacked natural light. We brought sunlight into the now combined living and dining room by adding sliding glass doors leading from the kitchen to the house’s backyard. We also installed new black-framed windows throughout, which updated the house’s facade.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">&#8220;In the end, we exceeded our budget, but we feel like all of the stress and uncertainty was worth the final product and long term investment.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we bought the home, it had been stripped of original details, but during work on the new living room we uncovered the brick fireplace, which had been hidden behind a closet. We had it pointed and we are so pleased that we managed to preserve this one striking original detail of our home. We ordered the black iron fireplace cover from a restoration company. It was made the same year as the house in 1899. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inside the kitchen, we focused on clean lines and chose materials that fit a mid-century modern aesthetic, which I love. The subway tile, walnut flat-panel cabinetry, and light fixtures all come together for a great retro-modern look. The cutout window seat is a super coffee-drinking spot. I tried to maintain that mid-century aesthetic throughout the home with neutral paint colors, natural woods, and lighting and furniture.</span></p>

<h3>Converting the upper-level apartment</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upper floors came next. The other apartment, a second and third-floor duplex, had a large kitchen on the home’s center floor. We’d decided to convert it to a master bedroom and remodel the second-floor bathroom as a master bath. The addition of a floor-to-ceiling window at the end of the second-floor hallway, overlooking the backyard, brings in light where it used to be horrendously dark. The third floor had two separate, large bedrooms for the girls, but no bathroom. We turned one of only two storage closets in the entire home into the girls’ bathroom. This is one place, along with the first-floor bathroom, where we deviated from the mid-century aesthetic, choosing Moroccan tile for a flash of pattern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hidden condition of the staircase shocked us. We planned to have the stairs leading from the first floor refinished with new treads, but our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor in Brooklyn</a> discovered that the 120-year-old wooden staircase was rotten. The construction team built us an entirely new staircase. The contractors gave us peace of mind that the house is stronger and safer now than it was before.</span></p>

<h3>The stress and cost were worth renovating their townhome</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The biggest challenge we faced was living in the home through most of the renovation. It was at times stressful, but I was fascinated, watching each stage unfold. Throughout the process, our Sweeten contractors and Sweeten were of great help.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ll say this: If you are renovating a 100-plus-year-old home, expect a substantial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portion of your budget</a> to go towards system upgrades like electrical, plumbing, heating, and the sewer line. After those things, plan on replacing a lot of worn-out materials—the roof, the stucco, and the windows, for starters. For an older home renovation, you’ve got to budget a much larger contingency. Our job went way over budget, partly because so many things needed to be replaced or upgraded.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, we exceeded our budget, but we feel like all of the stress and uncertainty were worth the final product and long-term investment. It feels gratifying to have crossed a major item—buying <i>and</i> renovating a house—off our bucket list! </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, Jill, Cy, and family, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After four years in their apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops Rita and Mark decided to renovate their kitchen (and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/crisp-white-bathroom-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). They weren’t sold on the kitchen’s footprint (due to the limited countertop and cabinet space) and debated whether or not to reimagine how everything was laid out. The couple also needed additional electric outlets—a common ask in older buildings. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and received matches that best aligned with their scope of work and budget. Rita and Mark </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and got started on the renovation.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38760 size-full" title="oak-cabinets-white-appliances-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets and square tiles on floor and white walls and white appliances before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ultimately the renovators decided to stick with the existing layout and focus on other high-impact details, like cabinetry, countertops, and a backsplash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita and Mark wanted mid-range cabinets, and finding the right style and price-point, at first, proved challenging. “There are many high-end cabinet makers and many low-end ones,” Rita said. They ended up going with Cliq Studios, who they worked with via email and on the phone. The dark wood cabinets they selected are classic and provide contrast to the bright white countertops and tile backsplash.</span></p>

It’s also our food-serving island when we entertain,” Rita shared. This gave them new workspace, without the hassle or expense of overhauling the layout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their contractor took the initiative throughout the project to tackle any budding issues head-on. Since the homeowners weren’t living in the apartment during the remodel either, his team coordinated all the deliveries to ensure they’d stay on track with timing. Not to mention, their contractor and team had a lot of experience <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with co-ops</a> which made this renovation move all the more smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Update old appliances, cabinetry, and fixtures</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sheryl lived in her Woodside, Queens co-op for over 15 years. She plans to stay in the apartment (originally built in 1935 as part of the New Deal initiative) for years to come and wanted to make her kitchen suited for the long haul. “I made the decision to renovate because I want to age-in-place in this home and felt now would be the best time to do it,” she shared. Since she was on board with the layout, Sheryl’s goal was to refresh everything else and add a dishwasher, which would be a first for her. After </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posting the project </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(which also included </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/neutral-bathrooms-spotlight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">her bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to Sweeten, she was matched with three Sweeten general contractors. They all provided estimates, visited her home, and then she </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose the contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that felt like the best fit.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40255 size-full" title="oak-kitchen-cabinets-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets with gray countertop and backsplash and window before renovation" width="775" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-Before-02.jpg 775w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-Before-02-233x300.jpg 233w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sheryl-Dold-Apt-Before-02-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The new kitchen came together seamlessly. Sheryl opted for a neutral palette with light gray cabinets and all stainless steel appliances. She added a slight pop of color and pattern in the backsplash with a row of light blue floral accent tiles. The stainless apron-front sink is deep and wide, perfect for watering plants or soaking dishes—though the new dishwasher can also take care of that.</span></p>

They ended up finding almost everything for the kitchen at one local supplier, which made it convenient for her. The process also helped offset the stress of living in the apartment during the renovation with her cat Lexie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with the work. It was exact, professional and beautifully done,” Sheryl said.</span></p>

<h3>A closed-off Brooklyn kitchen with potential</h3>
<p>A beautiful neighborhood, an optimal layout, and a lot of natural light led Melissa to purchase her corner apartment in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill Co-ops. The literary agent planned to renovate the kitchen and remove walls to take advantage of the light from the living area. Melissa also wanted to reflect the building’s mid-century style in her own space. “I wanted mid-century-Scandi-style-kitchen-meets-’70s-Italian-modern with warmer accents in the textiles and color,” she shared. Nearly 14 years after she bought her apartment, Melissa posted her renovation project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. She was <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a contractor</a> who helped her bring her kitchen dreams to life. The wait was worth it. (Even <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/scandinavian-white-ikea-kitchen-design-remodel-photos-266002">Apartment Therapy </a>thought so, as they covered the transformation as well!)</p>

<h3>Removing walls to create space in the kitchen</h3>
<div class="desc simple-text tt-content">
<p>Melissa worked with her interior designer, Danielle Herman of Persephone’s Spring, and a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a kitchen plan</a> and open up the space. The walls blocking the kitchen off from the living area were the first to go. Fortunately, the impact was instant: the room immediately brightened up. To take advantage of the newfound light, she chose a mix of materials, including matte <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete floor and counters</a>, to balance out the stainless steel appliances. “The goal was to reflect and refract the natural light,” Melissa shared. White Ikea cabinets and floating shelves contribute to the airy and spacious look.</p>
<p>A new peninsula offers additional seating while a built-in nook holds mugs, trinkets, and books. The location of the appliances remained as-is, but without the walls, the cook space <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a better flow</a>.</p>

<h3>The team brings a Scandi-style kitchen to life</h3>
<p>Melissa’s designer worked hand-in-hand with her Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor executing the vision</a> and selecting finishes, paint colors, and other details. Her contractor also had worked on many apartments in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a>, so he knew what to expect in terms of plumbing and support walls. “He knew ahead of time where the bodies were buried, so to speak,” Melissa said. He provided a detailed breakdown of the job, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a>, and timeline, and &#8220;stuck to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her only regret of the project? <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not doing it sooner</a>. Melissa wakes up every day excited “and delighted to return to cook dinner.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A kitchen pares down with integrated appliances in a landmark Brooklyn building</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-custom-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen with custom cabinets and kitchen island with butcher block after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Expanding a cramped kitchen in a Clinton Hill landmark townhouse</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2013, Kate and her husband, Graham, purchased a 4-unit townhouse built in 1890 in Clinton Hill, and moved into it with her two brothers and their families. (They operate the apartments within the townhouse as informal condos and share costs and decision-making.) While they knew that there were changes that needed to be made, they did not consider a gut renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="over-door-detailing-entrance-before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-01-723x482.jpg" alt="over door detailing and entrance before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and white counter before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Four years down the line, after living in the space, they determined that expanding and redoing a tiny kitchen that was tucked into the back corner of their apartment was a priority. It was closed off from the rest of the apartment inside an addition to the original house. The addition had been divided into a small galley kitchen and a second room that was “too small to be a living room or a dining room,” explained Kate. The narrow kitchen had small, outdated appliances and the refrigerator was awkwardly placed in front of a window. It was hard for two people to pass each other in the space. Given that the kitchen did not function at all the way their family needed it to, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a>, Kate and Graham envisioned an open space so that meal prep could be “a family activity and a space for doing homework while dinner was getting made,” said Kate. They wanted to go vertical with custom cabinets and counters to maximize the amount of surface and storage space. While they did need to remove a wall and a closet, they were intent on retaining as much of the original wood and plaster detailing as possible so that the new kitchen would pair seamlessly with the rest of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, landmark townhouse, white cabinets, pendant lights" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-kitchen-space-white-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="white open kitchen space with white kitchen cabinets and brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pantry cabinet next to the sink got a makeover; the glass panels had either been replaced with plywood or painted over, so they had new glass put in. It now makes a nice display for cookbooks and spices. &#8220;We believe that before the addition was put on the back of the house, that door would have been the exterior door to the yard,&#8221; said Kate. Demo revealed that the molding and flooring had continued throughout the original space as they predicted. The new layout also allowed more light into the rest of the apartment.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" title="white-overhead-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="white overhead kitchen cabinets over white quartz counter and open shelves after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="wide-doorway-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="wide doorway to a white kitchen space with white cabinets and pendant lights after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate and Graham chose integrated appliances for a built-in look. Given that the kitchen is now in plain view from the rest of the apartment, they did not want it “to scream ‘kitchen,’” explained Kate. The refrigerator replaces what used to be a closet and looks as if it has always been there, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disguised by a cabinet front</a>. They attempted to minimize stainless steel with hardware and cabinet choices that were “understated, practical, and looked more like built-in furniture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone mb-0" title="white-cabinets-small-white-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Kate-Malinowski-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="white cabinets and a small white counter along with brown dining table after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While quartz was chosen for the backsplash and countertops around the stove and sink for its durability, they softened up the space by topping the oversized island with butcher block. The wood floors were sanded and refinished for continuity with the rest of the home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinetry</a> was the most expensive choice that Kate and Graham made, but they &#8220;were committed to this expense from the beginning because [they] knew it was the only way to maximize storage space and because the cabinets are by far the most prominent feature of the kitchen,&#8221; said Kate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because they did not use an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect</a>, there was quite a bit of &#8220;game-time decision-making&#8221; that slowed things down. Now that the project is finished, however, the whole family loves the space. “The kids show off the fact that the fridge and microwave are hidden behind doors to everyone who comes over. We all spend most of our together-time in the kitchen now,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;And when people come over, it&#8217;s where everyone inevitably ends up hanging out.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: By hiding ductwork behind the upper cabinets, the couple was able to remove the drop ceiling in the kitchen to gain more height in the space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill renovation brings upgrades from the kitchen to a tough wood flooring decision</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British expat Sam and her American husband, Sean, had been living in Park Slope for several years when they made the decision to find a place to buy. While they casually searched in Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods, they also prepared their finances and readied themselves for when it came time to make an offer. A fortuitous series of events led them to bid on—and win!—the first apartment they visited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten <span class="s1">shares</span> their (enviably easy) search and how they transformed a long-empty, rundown apartment into a beautiful home for a growing family.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having heard horror stories from friends who suffered through multiple failed bids, Sam and Sean anticipated a difficult process. They imagined that they might also face rejection, so they jumped into the process with an offer after their first open house visit in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They realized that the space was old and hadn’t been lived in for quite some time, but were able to see past the grimy kitchen and bath, as well as the worn floors and peeling paint in this two-bedroom apartment in the famed Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’re big fans</a>, as you know). The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget for the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style="color: #000000;">Tom Stuart</span> (who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, Sam <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneath—a brave choice for a family bathroom!—Sam reports that they’ve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, the couple’s Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Sean’s preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had done—and are now in the process of doing—was to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: “Go to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors weren’t working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.” The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thanks to Sam, Sean, Ellie, Ernie, and baby Alice, for sharing your home! We hope that you’ll make some great memories in that gorgeous space. (Special thanks to Sam for sending over the list of resources on her due date!)</em></p>

Guest post by Clinton Hill homeowner Brian Kaplan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, we embarked on a six-month-long gut renovation. It included demolishing multiple walls to open the kitchen to the living room, removing rough stucco ceilings and refinishing them and installing new wood flooring throughout. The project occurred before we had our son, although Erin was pregnant for part of the time, which was a motivating factor to get it done! We then took a long hiatus but knew we’d be back at it someday. There are always more projects.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22961 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-Before-01-723x952.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-Before-01" width="723" height="952" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22968 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="1084" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six years later, we turned to the next <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big project</a>: refinishing the only bathroom in the apartment. It was in part prompted by necessity: a leak from an upstairs bathroom ruined our ceiling. And although we had done a large part of the work in our 2009 renovation ourselves, different circumstances this time led us to choose Sweeten to help us get it done. We knew that the project couldn’t be a weekend project, and most of the work—tiling, plumbing, etc—in a bathroom is highly specialized. Our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> was able to assist us in making sure we ordered all the correct things, and coordinated with and supervised the subcontractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fixtures and finishes were typical of ‘80s renovations—functional but tired. A couple of plumbing issues initiated the beginning of the renovation project. We knew we wanted something different from the common renovations in our building. I had spent a lot of time recently traveling for work so hotel bathrooms were the inspiration—however humble our own footprint: the clawfoot tub in the Hotel Condesa DF, the basin sink in the Park Hyatt Dubai, the plumbing fixtures in the Four Seasons in Guangzhou, and the light fixtures in the Hotel Tremezzo on Lake Como.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22963 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22965 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes are fairly simple but employed thoroughly—by selecting a clawfoot tub, the floor and wall tile automatically continue through the space a built-in tub would occupy, enriching the surfaces. We also continued the simple subway tile to the ceiling on all four walls to further enhance its impact. The toilet has a slender and tapered base, and the antique basin table is on legs highlighting the indigo glow of the glazed hex floor tile. The custom-fabricated medicine cabinet allows for display and easy access. We were able to partially recess the cabinet, which is made of red balau wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wall-mounted plumbing fixtures were unusual for our co-op, so it was a bit of a gamble to choose these types of fixtures. We didn’t know what the infrastructure behind the wall would look like. It turned out that the risers needed to be replaced, so we were able to customize our rough-ins.  The coordination with the clawfoot tub was another challenge. We found the basin table online and delivered it home from Hudson, NY, ourselves after a weekend camping and picked up the several-hundred-pound clawfoot tub at the UPS depot under the Kosciuszko Bridge in Brooklyn! A last-second request from our five-year-old son encouraged us to include a hand shower and transfer from the hydrostatic valve (and no, he didn’t actually use that term!). He hated how water got into his eyes with a regular shower, so he asked for his own hand sprayer. And finally, the finishing touch was the bathtub caddy, which reflected the intent of this project to be a retreat from the trials of daily life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22966 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22964 size-chrono" title="Prospect Heights bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-07-723x1083.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-07" width="723" height="1083" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with our co-op was a challenge where access to the plumbing chase and replacement of the aging riser was concerned, but our Sweeten contractor was very professional and managed the process as well as possible. We had difficulties working with our first contractor, and Sweeten saved this project by acting swiftly to help us hire a new contractor who understood the desperate situation we were in—with our only bathroom out of service for weeks already at that point. Our contractor worked with a plumber hired by our co-op, supervised the work, and mapped out where everything should be installed. We credit Sweeten and our Sweeten contractor for saving our sanity and completing our project as we’d envisioned it. Thank you!</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Kristen, Clinton Hill homeowner</em></p>
<p>Before moving to Clinton Hill, I lived in a 450-square-foot studio apartment in Brooklyn Heights for 10 years. I adored that apartment, but was ready to move into a new space after maneuvering around a small home that had few windows and limited space for entertaining. This apartment, a co-op in the Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a complex with considerable Sweeten history!</a>) is nearly twice as large at 800 square feet, and had been converted to a two-bedroom by the previous owners. I closed on this apartment in August 2016, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a>. <span class="s1">I had been looking at the site for a few months even before I found my apartment so by the time I was ready to start construction I had a clear sense of how the process worked. </span><span class="s1">Once I selected a contractor, the team at Sweeten checked in to make sure things were progressing. </span><span class="s2">My <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> and the architect made themselves available to come to the apartment multiple times before I closed so we could discuss the best options for my space. They presented a range of design ideas that addressed my needs/wants and they were always clear and upfront about costs and time frame. </span></p>
<p>I lived in my apartment for about eight weeks before construction began which allowed me to learn a bit about the space before making final decisions. I saw the apartment in the summer, so I knew the potential of the strong, natural light that existed and which areas needed a boost. I could consider how I&#8217;d like to live in each section of the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22489 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg" alt="Kristen-Floorplan" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My main objective was to open up the kitchen. A wall between the kitchen and living room dampened all the light, while a second wall featured a window frame-type of cutout with an awkward shoulder-height countertop. By knocking down the walls, the kitchen would open up into the dining and living areas, allowing those spaces to flow more easily—from workspace to entertaining to relaxation. Additional overhead lighting would brighten up the space even more.</p>

<p>I cook often and my priority for the kitchen was to install a peninsula with large, deep drawers so I could easily store large pots and pans and not keep them in the oven! It would provide substantial work space, and allow for an easy transitional section for entertaining. While they probably seem like minor choices, I think sliding double drawers for utensils and a separate spice cabinet were<span style="color: #000000;"> a</span> good use of space so items are readily accessible. Lastly, my previous building didn&#8217;t allow for a dishwasher, so being able to have one was a massive step up and a life-changing purchase!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My overall vision for the space was a bright, crisp but serene environment. I have worked in commercial art galleries for the past 17 years, so the artwork I own is really what I want to be the focal point of every space. I wanted the surroundings to quietly complement the art on view, and I think the clean lines really set up a solid framework to showcase the things I love.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, I wanted a modern, warm and clean kitchen that could serve as a neutral backdrop for any display of accessories, ceramics, or statement pieces. The previous cabinets were a wood color that dulled the natural light, and I chose instead a classic white shaker-style cabinet that worked nicely with the modern lines used elsewhere in the apartment. More functional than marble, the quartz countertop features traditional light gray veining that goes well with the gray variations of the flooring. Of all the choices to be made, I had the most difficult time finding a backsplash tile I liked; most were too clinical and slick or seemed dated. My Sweeten contractor brought me to a tile vendor for more options, and in the course showed me the material he had recently installed in his own full bath. Although he had used it as flooring, I really responded to the matte surface and the subtle geometric shape. Also on my wishlist was stainless steel appliances. I love that the oven is flush with the countertop with no back panel or raised display, enhancing the kitchen’s clean lines. I decided on brass hardware which doesn&#8217;t match the appliances, but the gold tones of the metal add another dimension without making things busy.</p>

<p>In addition to the kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the storage in the apartment. The interiors of some closets were refinished and cleaned up after years of use, while two bedroom closets were merged into one large one. The bathroom received an upgrade with a new sink, vanity and medicine cabinet. What makes me happiest is now there is a place for everything. In my old apartment, everything I owned had to serve several functions—the coffee table was also hidden storage, the closets were jammed with paperwork, clothing, cleaning products, and pantry items. My current apartment is so well organized; my beautiful bedroom closet makes me want to keep everything in its place.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge was patience. When you start a project like this, it can be very daunting if you have never done it before. I chose to live in the apartment while work was done, and while I wouldn&#8217;t change that decision, I think it took a toll. It was great to see the progress being made every day, but there are only so many nights you can be comfortable sleeping in plaster dust or having dinner behind a big plastic sheet. Doing construction in New York City has its trials—like getting to all the supply stores without a car. My Sweeten contractor and his crew doing the work on a daily basis were understanding and accommodating and that definitely lessened the stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I came into the renovation with many questions about timeframe and finances. I had heard horror stories about contractors abandoning jobs and I was fearful that I&#8217;d end up paying for an incomplete job. The members on my contractor’s team, however each were helpful in different ways. I really benefited from the experience and opinions of multiple people. The job wasn&#8217;t huge overall, but they treated me with respect, and knew this was a significant decision for me. They were all realistic about my options, pricing, and the pros/cons of different materials. It was challenging to keep everything straight, but anytime things went off course they were quickly corrected.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22481 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>On a more personal note, I was a bit nervous that I&#8217;d have a difficult time making so many decisions. There are infinite outlets for design and it&#8217;s easy to be overwhelmed even if you have a clear sense of your own style. Stay true to your goals and make decisions for your space that will benefit you every day. I learned that it pays off to do something bold even if it is small: the kitchen is neutral because it opens up into my living area, but the second bedroom didn’t face the same constraints. I painted it a dark green and love sitting in that space. In the end, I worried less about creating a showplace, and came away with a home that I am proud of and that suits me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Kristen, for sharing your beautiful home, and showing us how you use your space to surround yourself with the items you love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A creative Brooklyn couple came to Sweeten with an enviable problem: they had a gorgeous townhouse on their hands, big on charm and original details, but a little low on the storage and conveniences that a modern, entrepreneurial family needs. <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2016/02/my-beauty-uniform-kavi-ahuja-moltz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kavi Ahuja Moltz </a>and David Seth Moltz, the fabulous duo behind the small batch perfume and cologne company <a href="https://dsanddurga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. S. &amp; Durga</a>, loved the rich wood trim that framed each window and the inlaid wood floors that ground each room, but earlier renovations in the kitchen and bathrooms had replaced many original materials with a hodge-podge of finishes. Seeking the skills of a designer and contractor, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to Sweeten, a free service matching homeowners with contractors, and we found their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4877#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> to re-think space and feel in the kitchen and two bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-island-undermount-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg" alt="White kitchen island with undermount sink and multifunctional faucet facing kitchen with abstract backsplash after renovation" width="1000" height="668" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-07-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span id="more-17681"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill home presented an open kitchen plan with a large center island that had been updated with telltale features in the last decade: subway tile and a mix of wood finishes had been fit into an archway in the kitchen and pre-war moldings with gothic-inspired edges framed the oversized windows and a fridge nook. Storage was limited to two strips of base cabinetry and the butcher block counters added a third wood finish to the original floors and architectural details. Updates in the bathroom were similarly out of sync with the home’s original design, and a mix of modern tile, faux wood finishes, and slim storage left this family without a lot of storage options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor set out to preserve the most striking original floor and molding details and also push elements of the home toward a highly inventive and contemporary aesthetic.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-hardwood-floor-kitchen-bathroom-before" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48518 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown hardwood floored open kitchen and bathroom with tempered shower glass door before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kavi-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
(<em>credit for before photos: <a href="https://www.elliman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</a></em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without destroying any of those gorgeous hardwood floors, he addressed the most pressing of the to-dos first. The base cabinets were completely removed and replaced with a full wall of semi-gloss, flat front, white cabinetry from HenryBuilt with hidden hardware, framing the striking new <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf</a> stove. While they did lose the original wall pocket trimmed in molding that housed the fridge, the new <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HenryBuilt</a> cabinets are far better suited for pantry purposes, and the new fridge was re-located to the right of the stove, camouflaged seamlessly with paneling. White stone composite counters replaced the butcher’s block, and a larger island replaced the former, keeping a similar silhouette with a mahogany base and ample knee space for diners. The stainless undermount sink was also enlarged, with a dramatic multi-functional chrome faucet, a standard workhorse behind the scenes in most restaurants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The backsplash is where the real drama resides. White subway tiles were replaced with a kaleidoscope of black, gray, and white triangular tiles creating quite the abstract pop of modernity to the new kitchen that’s now a contemporary haven trimmed in pre-war luxe.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In each of the two bathrooms, the crew took a related design approach to tie in inspiration across eras, addressing the finishes without changing the footprint entirely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one full bath, tile again takes center stage with cement <a href="https://www.marrakechdesign.se/dandelion.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dandelion tile</a> in Lawn/Milk on the floors. These hex tiles with watercolor edges and abstract white lines depicting sunbursts replaced the previous, more subdued flooring. Simple white hex tile grounds the walk-in shower, and classic white subway tile stacked in a herringbone pattern extends up and around the walls. Frameless glass shower doors, a glossy lacquered double vanity with deep drawer storage, and a heated towel rack perfect this stylish high-low mix of materials. And because no detail was overlooked by this stylish couple, they opted for polished brass light fixtures to offset the muted tones and white on white textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kids’ bath, a parallel mix of white and gray shapes work equally simply to create a clean and bright space. White hex floor tile and contrasting gray grout is echoed with industrial white subway wall tile and more contrasting grout. Their Sweeten contractor made room for a new tub and double vanity, and added extra towel bar storage.</p>

			<h2>An outdated, clunky space gets ready for guests in this Clinton Hill kitchen renovation</h2>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovation of a Clinton Hill kitchen for entertaining and storage<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
<strong>Before</strong></span>: A<span style="font-weight: 400;"> kitchen renovation was some time in the making f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or Sarah, who works in finance, and Becky, who works for a media company. Sarah had been living in the one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops since 2010 (with Becky joining her in 2013) and had her sights set on overhauling the kitchen from the get-go. A previous renovation had tiled-off the kitchen, chopping up the open living space and giving guests a clunky raised border to trip over. White appliances and heavy cabinetry were outdated, and the kitchen’s generous square footage wasn’t all that functional for hosting or entertaining. After seeing successful Sweeten rehabs featured on <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/search?q=SWEETEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Therapy</a>, Sarah <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3621%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her renovation project to Sweeten</a>. “It seemed like an easy solution for such a risky kind of decision,” she said. The couple was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</span></p>

Thankfully, their contractor was up for anything. “He’s really a nice guy, super trustworthy and very patient,” Sarah said. “He was willing to wait throughout that time while I was redesigning things.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new plan was worth the hold-up: they would tear out the L-line of cabinetry and use multiple variations on open and closed storage on each of the walls and in a central island. Plus, they geared up to create a new entry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connecting the kitchen to the hallway, improving the flow around the apartment.</span></p>

Her original vision paired the white stone composite with gray cabinets, but after looking through Ikea photo pairings, a warmer, walnut-inspired wood started to feel like a better match.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HJHiUiD4Kw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="lowest-bid-video-link-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40749 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg" alt="video link image of should i take the lowest bid by sweeten founder" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-LowestBid-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give the Ikea base cabinetry some added oomph, Sarah chose custom doors from Semihandmade. Semihandmade also provided coordinating custom paneling for the new island—a gorgeous detail with the stark white waterfall countertop. The island’s added storage freed Becky and Sarah to be more adventurous with other cabinetry choices. They skipped an upper line of cabinets on the most visible wall and went with slim open shelving made from recycled wood. White globe pendants and sconces are anchored on an intricate porcelain backsplash tile; the tile’s folded paper-style pattern adds another level of visual detail in barely-there-beige. </span></p>

The summer-long process paused when the cabinets beat the doors’ arrival by a few weeks, and delivery of a few additional custom pieces dragged until January. Her advice to future renovators: temper your eagerness to get started, knowing that your patience will pay off with a more reasonable timeline (and with all of your packages in place). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sarah and Becky didn’t love hiding out in their bedroom for a good part of the summer, the new cohesive kitchen was worth it. The couple didn’t just survive they process—they thrived: Sarah and Becky recently got engaged! “It could have torn us apart but in the end it bonded us together,” said Sarah with a laugh.</span></p>
<p><em>Thanks, Sarah and Becky, for sharing your Clinton Hill kitchen renovation with us!</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The kitchen floor now matches the rest of the apartment’s original tongue and groove parquet—thanks to the contractor&#8217;s painstaking work to cut and stain new flooring to match the original (and no longer available) planks.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When a creative Clinton Hill couple came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> to find the right general contractor to renovate their aging co-op, we sent <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a> their way to create a new bath, alongside a new kitchen and hallway. Their original <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project post</a> called for a partial bathroom renovation, but for a couple who both work in graphic design and art, the temptation to work with a blank slate led to a top-to-bottom upgrade.<span id="more-13209"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13219" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before.png" alt="SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can&#8217;t tell from looking at the new sleek space, but the honest truth is that these homeowners poured all of their energy into designing and sourcing materials for their stunning <a href="https://sweeten.com/apartments/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen and flooring renovation</a>. By the time they got around to decision-making for the bathroom, they were determined not to over-design the space or spend more hours looking over tile choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Scandinavian design, they took a simple, clean, and functional approach in finding materials that would create a relaxing environment with no frills. White subway tiles anchored by dark slate floor tiles maximize brightness in the small space and amplify the extra square footage they carved out by doing away with the full-size bathtub. The new glass shower adds significant visual depth to the room, provides continuity for the tile&#8217;s subtle sheen, and gives a little gloss and polish to otherwise simple white and mirrored walls. Kris installed an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S79884333/#/S49023439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA sink cabinet</a> &#8211; a cost-saving piece with deep drawers that provides more storage than the old pedestal sink. Kris&#8217;s team also added a double-wide recessed medicine cabinet and re-located electrical outlets to make them more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Clinton Hill homeowner Diane moved into an apartment in a large, residential co-op on historic Clinton Avenue about a year and a half ago. Diane was no stranger to renovation and hoped to bring lessons learned from renovating a kitchen in a previous home to make the bathroom in her new home more functional and comfortable. The bathroom layout worked for Diane but the small space was in rough condition: large floor tiles covered the walls and were starting to loosen and crack. More importantly, Diane needed to adjust the height of most of the fixtures and add a few other touches around the room to customize the small space and make each element more comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="full-bathroom-with-black-white-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47969 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg" alt="small full bathroom with white wall tiles and pedastal sink with mirrored medicine cabinets and white and black floor tiles and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;My Sweeten contractors were so great &#8211; I could not have found a better contractor. Best experience I ever had.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Diane, Clinton Hill Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved Diane&#8217;s no-nonsense approach to this project. After a series of &#8220;nightmare&#8221; interactions with independent contractors, and after two different contacts walked with Diane&#8217;s deposits, Diane <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a> with all of her bases covered: she had already purchased new fixtures and navigated her building&#8217;s renovation approval process &#8211; two huge time-savers. We matched Diane with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Sean</a> who brought in rave reviews for responsiveness, staying in touch with project updates, and carefully protecting Diane&#8217;s home while work was underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To restore a bright, clean, and classic feel to the space, Diane turned to white subway tiles, an all-time Sweeten favorite for a crisp and easy-to-clean finish. As Sean&#8217;s team gutted the bath and cleared out layers of old tiles, Diane discovered<span id="more-11593"></span> an extra bonus; the work revealed two additional inches in the width and height of the room &#8211; a big win in a small bath!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="black-and-white-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47975 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5.jpg" alt="white bathroom with pedastal sink and mirrored medicine cabinets and bathtub with grab bar and black and white floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-5-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Diane set out to find a taller sink and toilet, a cast iron tub for soaking, and a grab bar for the shower/tub. Diane selected a Toto sink and toilet; the toilet&#8217;s design conceals all of the pipe work and extends to the floor with a seamless surface that makes it extra easy to keep clean. The new sink provides a full six inches of counter surface area behind the Toto faucet, putting daily items well within reach. Diane looked far and wide for a tub with relatively petite dimensions and found a gorgeous Porcher tub that fit the bill. Sean&#8217;s team customized the tub installation with tile work and a bench.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="full-bathroom-with-black-white-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47969 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg" alt="small full bathroom with white wall tiles and pedastal sink with mirrored medicine cabinets and white and black floor tiles and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="bathtub-with-grab-bar" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47974 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4.jpg" alt="bathtub with white wall tiles and grab bar and brushed nickel fixtures after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-After-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With such a sleek and classic finish, it&#8217;s hard to picture the major showstopper that Sean&#8217;s team expertly handled in the middle of the project. Because Diane had done so much prep work with her co-op board and already had all of the materials on site, Sean was ready to knock out the work in less than two weeks. A few days in, Sean discovered that the building&#8217;s stack of galvanized steel pipes behind the bathroom wall was corroded and rotting. Sean and team jumped in to manage the unexpected issue with Diane and the building&#8217;s management and got the project back on track in three days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re delighted that Sean and Diane made such a great team.

<h2>&#8220;Sweeten connected me with an awesome, smart, and honest contractor, which is all you need to make it happen.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Sanaya K., Clinton Hill homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a number of her <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/3-kitchen-renovations-in-brooklyn/">Clinton Hill Co-op neighbors</a>, homeowner Sanaya spent years living with decades-old cabinetry, outdated appliances, and unnecessarily cramped spaces before taking the plunge with a complete <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> renovation of her kitchen. &#8220;The kitchen was incredibly outdated,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;The cabinets were falling apart and I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit that there were cans of food holding up the shelves in one spot!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and her husband, Chris, had to contend with missing shelves and work around what looked like water damage from a prior leak. In addition, the original layout included a wall between the kitchen and pantry, which closed off both spaces and served no functional purpose. &#8220;It was tight,&#8221; Sanaya recalled. &#8220;Totally unnecessary, and made the space feel like a maze of walls.&#8221; Because of the placement of this dividing wall and the location of the refrigerator, counter space was seriously lacking. In her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/736">project post on Sweeten</a>, Sanaya did not mince words: &#8220;…everything must go.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with her Sweeten matches, Sanaya chose to work with Sweeten Expert, Alan, who helped bring together the homeowner’s renovation game plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10914 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/01_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10915 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/02_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10934 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/03_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya took on three unconventional design choices to replace existing finishes: counter tops, the backsplash, and flooring. <span id="more-10886"></span>After plenty of online research, she was originally inspired by wood counters, &#8220;I love wood counters!&#8221;, she explained. &#8220;Alan was very helpful with pros and cons. I swooned over that idea but ultimately decided against them &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to worry about the durability of the counters, near the stove and sink in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan helped to connect Sanaya with other homeowners who had considered similar choices and with an expert at Lowe&#8217;s in Red Hook who helped her determine the new kitchen layout. She ended up going with gray Caesarstone counters that beautifully offset the new, white shaker-style cabinets. For the backsplash, Sanaya chose a luminous blue-gray penny tile. Though they are more often used in bathrooms, here, the penny tile adds visual detail and pattern to the clean lines of the cabinets. Keeping with her goal of transforming and maximizing every last inch, Sanaya selected cork flooring, made in long planks, instead of the more typical square pieces. The natural accent brings warmth to the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10917 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10918 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/05_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10935 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/06_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sanaya and Chris (who, while renovating the kitchen, was simultaneously in the process of opening his second restaurant, <a href="https://www.centannibrooklyn.com/">Cent&#8217;Anni</a> in Crown Heights) were equal parts overwhelmed and happily immersed in the selection of these materials, and in the end, both are thrilled with the results. The new floor-to-ceiling cabinetry has dramatically increased the functional space of the kitchen. With the wall between the kitchen and pantry gone, Sanaya can easily access the additional storage and benefits every day from the counter space that was gained in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10920 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/07_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;There are whole shelves that I haven’t even moved into yet! I feel like I can breathe and cook freely without chopping vegetables on top of my cookbook. I am obsessed with how awesome the deep and long drawers are for pots and pans – it makes accessing them so much easier.&#8221; The project&#8217;s obvious functional benefits also brought along welcome aesthetic benefits, as Sanaya noted, &#8220;I’m so glad that some of the cabinets are glass – we get to look at some of our beautiful things that don’t get used daily, but they’re not in the way. And I am equally glad that most doors are wood – I don’t want to look at my pantry and no one else does either.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10937 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg" alt="clinton hill kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/10_SWEETEN_AMC-SanayaKitchen1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While Sanaya and her husband are still playing with their new storage solutions and reveling in the new space, the completed renovation has left a hankering for more. &#8220;Now, I want to do so much more,&#8221; Sanaya says, laughing. &#8220;I want to rethink our living/dining room and perhaps install built-in shelves there and in the main hallway. And maybe it’s time to repaint our bedroom…the endless project!&#8221;</p>

We&#8217;d love to hear your take on the layout options &#8212; which do you prefer?</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since Billy &amp; Sally came to us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their cramped Clinton Hill kitchen</a> last year, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time Sweetening homes in the Clinton Hill co-ops. One of the most remarkable things about these projects is that they all start with the exact same, 1940&#8217;s bones, but by the end, no two of these spaces ends up anything alike. I personally cannot decide which of these kitchens I love most, but one thing is for sure, they have all come a very long way! Have a look at these three renovation outcomes and let us know which you like best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This is certainly one of those renovations that I have been anticipating with bated breath. Partly because the amazing homeowners, Kyle, an IT professional at a law firm, and Angela, a freelance illustrator, have the style and the je ne sais quoi to totally charm; but also, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I love projects like this one</a>, where the homeowners have lived in the space, dreamed about what it will be one day, and saved up for years towards the goal of making that dream home their real home. It gives all of us who may still be far from that goal, a sense of possibility.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We&#8217;d been living here for eleven years and things were starting to get a bit shabby. When we moved in, the apartment had been freshly renovated with all the cheapest materials available at Home Depot, which was fine back then, but we really wanted to make it &#8216;ours.&#8217; We saved up for renovations all the while and put a lot of thought into what we wanted to do.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;"> &#8211;Angela, homeowner</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the time had arrived early this year, Kyle and Angela (and their &#8220;mean, little chihuahua&#8221;) posted to Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to get started on renovating</a> their 900 sq/ft, 2 bedroom Clinton Hill co-op apartment. The road to selecting &#8216;the perfect contractor&#8217; was made a whole lot sweeter by our three suggestions; according to Angela, “we feel confident that any of the contractors Sweeten selected for us would have done a great job, but we&#8217;re really happy that we chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a>.&#8221; Kris and his team were able to take the homeowners&#8217; dreams of extra counter space for baking and a place that showed off their personal mid-century style, and turn them into a reality, on-time and within-budget!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kris&#8217; team worked closely with Kyle and Angela to meet their main objectives for the project: to create a modern, open apartment AND stay on budget. First order of business was making the &#8216;big moves,&#8217; which meant tearing down the non-structural interior walls and tearing up the outdated and damaged parquet flooring. With just these changes, the homeowners could already begin to anticipate their moment of, “I can hardly believe it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve lived for the past decade!”<span id="more-10713"></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What I love about Kris and his team is that, not only are they exceptional at getting the work done well and on-time, but their custom millwork is always so impressive! They worked with Kyle and Angela&#8217;s mid-century modern aesthetic and came up with this gorgeous walnut custom cabinet system that I assure you will never wear out, but only wear in, as this lucky couple grows into their space. For their backsplash, the homeowners went bold with a bright green mosaic tile, <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R&#8217;ceef 5 in lime green</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Along with opening the kitchen came operation living-room-update-and-integrate. This meant that although that rich orangey/yellowish wall color is one of beauty, it needed to be refreshed and made more current with a clean, modern white. Underfoot, the old parquets were replaced throughout with new flooring in unstained white oak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10722 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/09_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10723 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Although transitioning to a more modern aesthetic, Kyle and Angela wanted to keep a vintage vibe pulsing through their new space. The couple mixed mid-century based furniture, including a set of classic <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eames molded plastic/wire dining chairs</a>, a pair of vintage Heywood-Wakefield side tables, and a period-inspired <a href="https://www.radiusstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elite Four walnut credenza</a> by Radius Innovative Design, with more current pieces like their <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble and stainless steel portica table</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10724 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of tracking home renovations is seeing how people choose to highlight the art and objects that make up their personal collection. Throughout Kyle and Angela&#8217;s living area, the couple showcases their very impressive collection of prints by California-based artist, <a href="https://www.shag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shag</a>, and mid-century album covers by illustrator <a href="https://www.jimflora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Flora</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10725 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Over the dining table, they were able to bring some of that green from their backsplash out of the kitchen in another retro accent, <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rejuvenation&#8217;s Astron Tri chandelier</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10727 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Kyle and Angela could not have been more excited to finally be rid of the outdated (Home Depot-centric) bathroom decor that they had come to love to hate (scroll to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it here</a>), in exchange for their bright new, modern and material-rich space. The deep soaking tub from Kohler is cloaked, like the walls, in super white subway tile, and floating beside it is a dark oak Fresca Vanity with Versa faucet, both from <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a>. I personally love the texture that the carrera marble tiled floor adds to this sleek space.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10726 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png" alt="brooklyn apartment renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13_SWEETEN_FamuratBuilders-kyleangela-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">All in all, this home looks great and I can&#8217;t get enough of the true personality inside. Many thanks and congrats to the happy homeowners, Angela and Kyle! Also, big thanks to Sweeten Expert Kris, Natalia, and the rest of the team for the excellent work in making this home a whole lot sweeter!</p>

<p>Joanna &amp; Mark&#8217;s 1-bedroom loft in Clinton Hill was a perfect place for the couple to spread out and enjoy their work &amp; hobbies &#8211;that is, until the day they found out they&#8217;d be having a baby! With a new addition to the family on her way, the mother &amp; father-to-be needed to make <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some changes</a> at home, including more storage options and, of course, a place for their daughter, while also keeping workspace available for Mark, a composer, multimedia artist &amp; student. So, the expecting couple posted their project to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors and, after meeting their matches, chose a Sweeten general contractor for their renovation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hardwood-floors-and-white-walls"  class="wp-image-38650 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-560x420.jpeg" alt="living room with track lights and white walls and hardwood floors and doors after renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/x-large-4-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Before renovating, the 950 sqft loft had a lot of open space, including an area for Mark to practice music and store his equipment.</p>
<p><span id="more-7500"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="planning-and-building-a-bedroom"  class="wp-image-38651 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-560x420.jpeg" alt="planning and building a bedroom with a curved wall corner next to living room during renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Here&#8217;s that same view right after demo of the master bedroom walls; the workers are mapping out where the new walls will go. More on the design and construction process for this project <a href="/2012/12/06/site-visit-designing-for-a-bk-loft-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-with-curved-wall-corner"  class="wp-image-38652 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-560x311.jpg" alt="living room and hallway with hardwood floors and gray walls and barn door and round wall corner floor to ceiling built-in bookshelves at the end of hallway after renovation" width="560" height="311" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> And here&#8217;s the finished space! The master bedroom stayed in the same location but was slightly reduced in size, and the new baby&#8217;s room is entered from the opposite side, near the bookshelf. Sarah was able to include a small nook for Mark&#8217;s music setup that opens to the living room or can be closed off &amp; out of sight behind a gorgeous reclaimed barn door on sliding hardware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7508 mb-24 " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg" alt="caption" width="560" height="235" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/05_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-300x126.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Looking back at an interior elevation drawing of the planned space before it was built &#8211;it&#8217;s so awesome to see how the design elements translated into real life!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-with-large-barn-door"  class="wp-image-38653 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x356.jpg" alt="open living and dining with a large barn door and gray wall and hardwood floors and track lighting and large window after renovation" width="560" height="356" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/06_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-300x191.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />It&#8217;s also great that Mark &amp; Joanna did not have to sacrifice their living space, yet their new home does so much more than before!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="end-of-hallway-book-shelves"  class="wp-image-38654 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-560x1015.jpg" alt="built-in floor to ceiling book shelves at the end of hallway with hardwood floors and pendant light and gray walls after renovation" width="560" height="1015" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-166x300.jpg 166w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/07_theSweeten_GenAssembly_ClintonHill-2-1-497x900.jpg 497w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />Sarah designed this floor-to-ceiling bookshelf which stores the family&#8217;s book collection and highlights the high-ceilings found throughout the space. Working closely with Joanna &amp; Mark, the designer also planned a future phase of their project which includes more ceiling-high shelving and a library ladder. Phasing their project out in this way gave the couple more opportunity to work within a budget.</p>
