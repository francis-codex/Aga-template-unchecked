<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Building on the success of their first counter-serve restaurant in Chinatown, the founders of Chikarashi develop their hold on a modern interpretation of poke (pronounced poh-</em>keh<em>), a traditional Polynesian dish, with a second location in NoMad. They called on Sweeten to execute the design for the new space, influenced by Japanese minimalism with all-wood paneling and counter seating. The brand is garnering raves (Eater praised their &#8220;chef-driven poke,&#8221;) and is also working with Sweeten on a third location—their flagship—in the Financial District. </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Tell us a little bit about Chikarashi and how the brand began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chef Michael:</strong> The brand began with an idea from Ivy and Selwyn wanting to bring a Polynesian restaurant to Chinatown. They had some ideas considering the food culture and popularity that were going on in the market when I was brought into the project. I thought about the ingredients that are common and used my Japanese training to add to chirashi (a big bowl of rice mixed with fish and vegetables) and to an overall poke concept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of your brick-and-mortar store?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Selwyn:</strong> For our initial location, we were looking to do a nice concept in the Chinatown neighborhood that was not Chinese food. We had always been enamored with Japanese cuisine and saw the bubbling trend of the poke coming up. We liked the concept, but didn’t like any of the execution that was going around, so we partnered with Chef Mike to create our own take on it. The brick-and-mortar space was obviously something that we needed. We had come across a small space that was available and knew this concept wouldn&#8217;t require a full, traditional kitchen build, but could be done quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How does your new restaurant space represent your brand?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ivy:</b> We serve Japanese chirashi and poke-inspired bowls, so in terms of the design, we would naturally lean towards Japanese minimalism. We took design cues from smaller shops in Japan and brought them into our space here. In both the Canal Street and this new location, we brought in a lot of earth tones with the walls paneled in maple wood. You get a similar sense if you were to walk into a ramen shop or a sushi restaurant in Japan, or Kyoto. We decided to not have a large space, but that something roughly 700 square feet was a nice size to work with. It’s a little bit more cozy and mainly for people to come in to take their bowls to go or to sit down. We have eight seats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten and how do you think Sweeten can help business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Sweeten has been really wonderful because it’s almost a one-stop shop, if you will. They offer a lot of guidance and the vetting of their partners is pretty extensive. We felt really comfortable when it came time to select a general contractor to work on the project itself, that the company would fulfill the needs of the build but also would fit well from a chemistry standpoint. I think Sweeten handles that matching process wonderfully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sweeten:</b> Did you have any last questions going into the project that you felt that Sweeten was able to help you with?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Selwyn:</b> Yeah, absolutely. Sweeten was always there to kind of help navigate at every step of the process. Any questions were always answered in a quick fashion and they really offered their years of expertise to make the entire process a smooth renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Now you can have America’s-next-top-chef pro-style quality at home</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone" title="a chef's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Cara_Kitchen-Bathroom-11-723x487.jpg" alt="White galley kitchen with commercial style kitchen appliances" width="723" height="487" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em> (Above)</em> Cara and Jared <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/">kitchen renovation</a></span></p>
<p>When commercial appliances first appeared on the home kitchen scene some 20 years ago, they were the couture of cooking: beautiful, very expensive, and available only to a select few who could manage the price tag and installation. With the renaissance of home entertaining and the widespread popularity of cooking shows, manufacturers have answered the homeowners’ call for a commercial style that can easily fit into a new or renovated kitchen. Looks still lead the way, with shimmering stainless steel and sturdy controls. Function has kept up, too, thanks to improvements in cooking, cooling, and cleaning, to justify that price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Ranges </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s much easier these days to purchase a commercial-style kitchen range for a home. You&#8217;ll find ranges that provide the function you seek, at a size and scale that fits into a home kitchen. Serious at-home chefs covet range features like cast-iron grates, stainless-steel surfaces, and quick-to-heat burners controlled by sizeable knobs. The controls with the <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCS collection from Fisher &amp; Paykel</a> are illuminated, a safety feature that adds an extra touch of glamour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of commercial-style kitchen ranges: they offer flexibility, which home cooks need. One such example is dual fuel, or ranges that feature a gas cooktop plus an electric oven. This provides the immediacy and control of a gas cooktop, with cooking power of up to 25,000 BTUs, and the precise performance of a true convection oven. Modern ranges also have digital panels that help you program correct temperature and cooking times to assure perfect results.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a commercial-style range, there are a few drawbacks you should consider. Some commercial-style kitchen range models have smaller oven cavities than their non-pro-style counterparts, so check the size to make it can handle your Thanksgiving turkey. The self-cleaning feature may also need to be sacrificed if that’s not important to you. Luckily, you’ll make it up in adjustable grates, cooktop grills, and superior simmering capabilities with flames that go as low as 140 degrees. Some brands have unique features. Thermador’s burners, in the shape of the company’s star emblem, disperse the flame heat to more evenly heat the entire surface of a pot. Fisher &amp; Paykel’s racking system allows the rack to extend as much as 75 percent outside the oven cavity, handy when removing a heavy dish, like a roast or a Dutch oven.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Kitchen Refrigerators</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first commercial kitchen refrigerators to capture the imagination came with glass doors. It&#8217;s ideal for a professional kitchen, as many chefs working together simultaneously need to see what’s inside quickly and easily. For the home cook, <a href="https://true-residential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Refrigeration</a> offers a stainless-framed glass door option reminiscent of that commercial version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another key feature of a commercial kitchen fridge is stainless steel. As an external material, it lends a pro-style touch. Also, some manufacturers, like True, offer stainless steel as an interior finish, too. Newer fridge models have black stainless steel for an extra touch of drama. Considering color? <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueStar</a> claims to have more than 750 colors and finish combos to match its cooking products.</p>
<h4>Features inside the fridge</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What’s going on behind cool-looking doors is just as important to the home chef, who may shop once a week and needs all that food to stay fresh. Look for features like individual climate-controlled drawers, adjustable racking systems, and extra-large shelves to hold entertainment platters and pizzas. <a href="https://www.thermador.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thermador</a> has introduced removable bins on the fridge door that can be loaded with ingredients for meals during the week, then removed to the kitchen counter when it’s time to prep dinner.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-style Dishwasher</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Real commercial dishwashers, perhaps surprisingly, lack all the features that homeowners have come to depend on. They basically serve to wash and sanitize, so you won’t find them with adjustable racking systems or garbage disposals. In fact, with a true pro version, you would have to thoroughly rinse the glasses and dishes before placing them in the washer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re set on a commercial-style, dishwasher, start with stainless steel. This sparkling metal says the appliance means business, just like its cooking and cooling counterparts described above. Hefty, architectural handles complete the pro-style effect (unless you prefer a look with controls hidden on the inside panel.) Inside, look for adaptable features like adjustable or removable racks and baskets. As for function, there’s plenty from popular manufacturers to make you happy, including a range of wash cycles, a timer, super-quiet operation, and a childproof lock. Want all the bells and whistles? Spring for a third rack from manufacturers like Bosch, or a built-in water softener from <a href="https://www.jennair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn-Air</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial-Style Kitchen Faucets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucet</a> two decades ago forever changed our impression of this indispensable kitchen tool. Finally, with minimum effort (and splashing), you could spray the entire sink—as well as the inside of a pasta pot. Commercial-style kitchen faucets take this advantage a step further. Many offer single-handle operation, a higher-than-average arc, and a spray that can swivel 360 degrees. Look to plumbing experts like <a href="https://www.isenbergfaucets.com/kitchen/">Isenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/kitchen-faucets/article/CNT125900008.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler</a>, and <a href="https://www.grohe.us/kitchen/kitchen-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grohe</a> for more handy options. There are even options for foot control, for completely hands-free operation, like the pros enjoy. If you love sparkling water, Grohe also makes a pro-style faucet that puts fizz in your tap water when you want it.</p>
<h3><strong>Commercial Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peek inside a commercial kitchen and you’re likely to see stainless steel on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counter surfaces</a>. The sanitary, odor- and moisture-impervious benefits are obvious. However, dings and scratches become pretty obvious. If the patina of usage isn’t for you, check out natural or engineered stone. Professional chefs love it for the same reasons homeowners do: it can take heat without scorching, yet stays cool to the touch. Natural stones such as granite and marble will, nevertheless, show stains, so if you don’t want to risk marring the perfect surface, consider an engineered stone like <a href="https://www.dekton.com/usa/what-is-dekton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dekton</a> or <a href="https://www.caesarstoneus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caesarstone</a>, which claim to resist all liquids, including wine and juice.</p>
<h4>Creating a commercial-style kitchen at home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning a kitchen renovation involves loads of decisions as you work your way through all the choices for appliances and materials. Commercial style kitchens, while at the higher end of the budget spectrum, remains a classic, and a trend with staying power, if you take the time to find those products that sync with your individual cooking style.
