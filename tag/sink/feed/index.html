			<h2>A double sink vanity can introduce extra space to spread out in the bathroom, without skimping on style</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41433 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05.jpg" alt="built-in bath storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you have the space, adding a double-sink vanity when remodeling your bathroom comes with many benefits. This luxury allows two people to simultaneously share the room while having personal space. Time is saved and each has use of their own sink.</p>
<p>Double-sink vanities also offer extra storage space, with options like additional drawers and cabinets. The positive upgrades add up to an increase in home value for many homeowners. Here, we show six Sweeten renovators who chose double-sink vanities when renovating their baths.</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>A double-sink vanity for a touch of luxury</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02.jpg" alt="black tile shower and white barn door" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50861" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Despite multiple hurdles put in Isis and Stephano’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-brooklyn-brownstone-bathroom-gets-its-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovation path</a> for a long-awaited bathroom remodel, the couple persevered. From misaligned measurements to a barn door that was too heavy to be installed, their contractor worked out solutions for each issue. “It took amazing Tetris skills” to also fit the double sink vanity that had gotten cut off. The dream bathroom would serve the family of five well with double sinks, a shower, and laundry.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> If you are thinking of upgrading from a single to a double sink, remember to factor in the cost of additional plumbing.</p>
<h3>Updating for a forever home</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46861 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="Chicago bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Leah and Brian wanted to make their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago condo more modern</a>. It would be a home they planned on staying in—not selling. They focused on renovating their kitchen and bath, moving away from the browns and beiges. For the bath, they kept the footprint the same. They already had a double-sink vanity, so they just upgraded it with a more contemporary one. They replaced the busy brown and white marble with a muted gray-white countertop.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Know your size. Standard single-sink vanities range anywhere from 36-48 inches. Standard double-sink vanities are much longer, ranging from 60-72 inches. Talk with your contractor and check that your space can fit this design.</p>
<h3>A tight—but golden-glamorous—double sink</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44091 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-07-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />For Jenifer Herrmann, a media exec, and her partner, Mitzie Wong, a designer, painter, and co-founder of creative design firm Roar + Rabbit, it was important to have their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home reflect their styles and personalities.</a> They came to Sweeten and found a contractor to bring their master bath in Brooklyn to life. &#8220;Our big goal for the master bath was to add a double vanity—a tight squeeze and ultimately a feat,&#8221; said Jenifer, &#8220;since we didn’t find a 60-inch-wide unit with storage that we both liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vanity they chose doesn&#8217;t have cabinets but luckily their Sweeten contractor came to the rescue. During demolition, he found an extra 6-8 inches in depth between the wall studs, which they used as additional storage space.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Make sure you meet both your form and function needs, like Jenifer and Mitzie. Even though their selected vanity didn&#8217;t have storage, they were able to add it elsewhere. There are many different styles of double sink vanities—free-standing, wall-mounted, floating—so be sure to match your style preferences with your everyday needs.</p>
<h3>A bright, airy, and shareable double sink setup</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-hexagon-floor-tiles-brown-vanity" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44090 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="black hexagon floor tiles with brown floating vanity and white double sink and long wide mirror vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-600x898.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jill-master-bathroom-1-585x875.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Jill and Cy needed more space for their family. Instead of moving to the suburbs, they purchased a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 1,920-square-foot townhome</a>. Jill wanted a master bath that would accommodate their busy lifestyle. It needed to be bright, airy, and functional. She selected a double-sink vanity that she and Cy could share easily with long drawers for storage. In addition, she had her Sweeten contractor custom build the mirror and medicine cabinets above to match the floating vanity.</p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> There are many benefits of a double-sink vanity. A key benefit? Saved time. Two sinks make it easy for couples or families to get through their morning routines without disrupting or delaying each other.</p>
<h3>A dresser produces the feel of a living space</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1.jpg" alt="repurposed double sink vanity table" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47468" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/77981-Liz-Bath-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sweeten homeowners Liz and Kevin planned their new <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom remodel</a> around their love of mid-century design. They purchased a vintage walnut dresser in hopes of repurposing it into a sink vanity. A high-rimmed, shallow trough sink sat on top. The height of the sink raised the low-sitting dresser to standard vanity height. Brass fixtures and orange penny backsplash completed the mid-century look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><strong>Pro advice:</strong> If you lose storage space during the renovation process, vanities can make up for it. There are so many free-standing, double-sink vanities to choose from that have multiple drawers and cabinets to accommodate all your necessities.</p>
<h3>A sink for two with sensory features</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42065" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Ylia-Rosario-Andre-McClure-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For their master <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/fixer-upper-washington-heights-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation</a>, Isis and Andre decided it would look unique, be efficient, and have spa-like qualities. Their architect surprised them with a sketch of an unpredictable infinity soapstone dual sink. They loved it. Black penny tile injects shape and movement opposite 24” x 24” stone-like wall tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Pro advice:</strong> Additional sinks can increase your home’s value. A bathroom vanity with more space and a personal sink is an upgrade for many homeowners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tackling a bigger bathroom renovation project—six ways to make the most of the space you have</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a too-small bathroom?  While some renovators choose to expand the space or reimagine the footprint, those types of changes can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the budget</a>. So how can you make a bathroom appear larger with the space you already have? Read on to learn how Sweeten general contractors undertook bigger bathroom renovation projects. Here&#8217;s how they updated homeowners&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small bathrooms to feel bigger—without changing the overall square footage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1.) Install a floating vanity<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25453 size-full" title="floating vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="floating vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>If having a closet in or next to your bathroom isn&#8217;t an option, consider a vanity with drawers or doors. Some vanities are freestanding, but floating vanities are attached to the wall and do not “sit” on the ground. That extra space means the flooring can extend to the wall, which actually makes the room look larger. Nancy&#8217;s bathroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectly demonstrates that idea</a>, showing off the ornate black and white tile. Since she couldn&#8217;t change the layout of the space due to code compliance, this offered a great alternative in the overall vision of opening up the bathroom.</p>
<h2><b>2.) Or if you have enough storage, try a pedestal sink</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38077 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="black-hexagon-bathroom-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" alt="pedastal sink with black faucet and fixtures and wooden shelves above toilet and black hexagon floor tiles and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">If storage isn’t an issue, a classic space-saving option is a pedestal sink. In Saira and her husband’s East Village apartment, they had two small bathrooms they needed to update to accommodate their family of four. In the powder room, they opted for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/"><span class="s1">classic, white porcelain pedestal sink.</span></a> They used shelving above the toilet and a mirrored vanity for their storage needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp" alt="Black and white bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy and Chris chose a</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pedestal sink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with console legs that show off the tiled walls and floors, and give this classic NYC bathroom a more spacious feel. &#8220;In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets,&#8221; Jeremy shared.</span></p>
<h2><b>3) Stick with neutrals or go tone-on-tone</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33805 size-full" title="glass-shower-door-vanity-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="white farmhouse sink near glass shower door to walk in shower and vanity mirror over marble countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Too much color can be hard to get right in a small space. A safe bet to opening up a small bathroom? Choose neutrals that don’t compete for attention. Jessica and Kevin swapped out pink marble for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bathroom-goes-from-clunky-to-classy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white and gray color palette</a> that lent their space a more spa-like feel.</p>
<h2><b>4.) Opt for a larger mirror</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36996 size-full" title="small bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" alt="small bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina had wanted to renovate her 550-square-foot studio in Murray Hill since she moved in. She knew exactly what she wanted—including tons of bathroom storage space. To achieve this, she </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed a large, mirrored medicine cabinet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The mirror takes up most of the wall, automatically giving the room the illusion of more space, without changing the layout at all.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5.) Take advantage of wall space</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22407 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="recessed storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="Scandinavian white bathroom with storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">Even if your bathroom has a small footprint, you can always build onto the wall, or in Maria and Eric&#8217;s case <i>into</i> the walls. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/"><span class="s1">recessed shelving</span></a> unit tucks in just behind their bathroom door. This minimalist solution boasts more storage without adding bulk.</p>
<h2><b>6.) Ditch the tub &amp; shower curtain for a bigger bathroom</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30666 size-full" title="light-filled bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg" alt="light-filled bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_TaraDowd_Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>A fairly common bigger bathroom renovation project is to ditch the tub in favor of a walk-in shower with <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-new-baths-top-off-a-remodel-odyssey/">a glass shower door.</a> Using glass in place of a shower curtain allows light to flow through the space, which is especially important if the bathroom has a single source of natural light. In one of Tara and Mike&#8217;s bathrooms, they did just that, while leaving the rest of the floorplan as-is.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Gramercy Park bathroom, bathroom renovation, tile, glass divider, tile floor, tile wall, toilet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A glass bathroom door is even more effective when used in an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open shower style</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like in Charon and Lex’s bathroom. Removing the tub altogether opened up the space, making it more comfortable for two people (especially since Lex is 6&#8217;2&#8243;)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another factor that worked in their favor: the use of one color (in different shades). </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Pre-fab cabinetry—like a pantry cabinet from IKEA—can be a simple way to fulfill the kitchen renovation ideas you’ve been dreaming about</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning your new kitchen design is an exciting time. It’s fun to walk through a big-box store like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, or <a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and start brainstorming the look and feel of your space. These types of stores offer pretty much everything you need to build your kitchen, from cabinets and countertops to appliances, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faucets</a>, sinks, and more. Even if you’re choosing to design and sketch out your own kitchen renovation ideas from scratch, it’s good to know what’s out there. Below are five examples of Sweeten kitchens that feature IKEA products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25466 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, pantry cabinet, countertop, sink, and oven range</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to create a contemporary design that would mesh well with the original molding and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwood flooring</a> in their new home, Jerry and Janet chose <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base cabinetry</a>—and a tall pantry cabinet—with molding from IKEA. To give them a modern edge, they had them painted in Balboa Mist and Classic Gray by Benjamin Moore. The gray tones were then incorporated into the design of their geometric backsplash tile and contrasted by a white countertop.</p>

Ursula</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, island, and hood</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ursula transformed a dark kitchen that lacked windows into a lighter and brighter space by incorporating white cabinets with a high-gloss finish. Since the kitchen didn’t offer much in the way of prep space, she implemented a few clever kitchen renovation ideas with an island from IKEA that resembles a dresser and went for a dusky shade of gray to add some contrast. Stainless steel appliances completed the look, including a super sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hood</a> that reflects the light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25469 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Fabio and Melina</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a narrow <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley kitchen</a> that hadn’t been touched in 40 years, Fabio and Melina set out to design a whole new space that matched their personal tastes. They chose black cabinets to cement their strong point of view and included a few glass-fronted doors. A white countertop adds the perfect amount of contrast while a patterned floor tile helps tie the look together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25470 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="487" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-723x487.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
Laura and Matthew</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, countertops, sink, faucet, and microwave</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laura and Matthew realized that the original cabinets in their new home had been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">painted</a> several times over and couldn’t be salvaged, so they purchased all new cabinets in a soft shade of gray. They also found a stainless steel microwave at IKEA that matched the look of their new range for a crisp, uniform appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25471 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="pantry cabinet, kitchen renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregg and Kelly</a>’s IKEA Finds: Cabinets, sink, and faucet</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With two windows nestled in shadowy nooks and dark cabinets in the existing kitchen, Gregg and Kelly knew that they wanted it to feel as light and airy as possible. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knocking down walls</a> filled the space with natural light, and white, high-gloss cabinets with flat front doors brightened up the kitchen even more. Honed black granite countertops provide a pop of contrast against the white backdrop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>To outfit this crowd-pleaser, choose the right spot to build; add a good grill and other outdoor kitchen appliances</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25421 size-chrono" title="outdoor kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg" alt="outdoor kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amagansett_C-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>(Above) This Kalamazoo outdoor kitchen features a built-in grill, weather-tight cabinets, refrigerator drawers, and a pizza oven sitting on the countertop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to eat out more often, but hate spending a fortune on restaurants, you should consider an outdoor kitchen. While you can spend almost as much on an <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/outdoor-kitchen-patio-ideas/">outdoor kitchen</a> as your indoor one, it’ll ultimately add resale value to your home. In a recent study, the National Association of Home Builders reported that outdoor kitchens add at least 100 percent of their value to a home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the most of your outdoor kitchen, consider carefully these points:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enhance your outdoor kitchen space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work with your contractor on finding the ideal location to build out your kitchen. Classic materials like brick, stone, or stucco can work nicely with many architectural styles of a home. These materials work especially well with older homes—and appear integrated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Make your outdoor kitchen comfortable</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allow room for dining and lounging both before and after the meal. You&#8217;ll need a shady or covered area paved with stone or wood to support furniture. You also want to add lighting for the dining and seating area, plus the kitchen area. This way, you&#8217;ll enjoy the space after sundown, while having an <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/entertaining-kitchens/">open plan that keeps the cook near the guests</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pick outdoor kitchen appliances wisely</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buy only what you know you will really use. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Avoid fixtures that serve only one function, unless you will use them regularly</a>. If your family loves pizza, by all means, add the pizza oven. If you entertain frequently, you can use a warming drawer. But do you really need that smoker?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Invest in high-quality outdoor kitchen materials</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything that goes into your outdoor kitchen should be made to work outdoors. But, still, everything you have installed will remain outside year-round, so it needs to be able to withstand changing weather. Buy from brands with national reputations so you can get a customer service person when you need one, including on the weekend. Also, <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/5-ways-care-renovated-home/">check the warranties</a> to make certain the company will back up their products.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expect the unexpected</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point, an appliance or pipe will have to be repaired or possibly replaced. Work with your contractor to design installation so that electrical, gas, and water can be easily reached for repair or adjustment, if needed, without breaking down any beautiful stone surround or concrete foundation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plan the setup and location of your outdoor kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your setup can be built-in or freestanding, depending on its location in relation to the structure of your house. Freestanding is quicker to get up and running, and you can take some features (like the grill) with you, should you move. However, built-in gives a more designed look and allows for optional but important features like a sink. ”If they are relatively close together, an outdoor kitchen can utilize the indoor kitchen’s capabilities, such as prep space and storage,” says Russ Faulk, chief designer and head of product for <a href="https://kalamazoogourmet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet</a>, a manufacturer of outdoor kitchen appliances. “Conversely, a fully independent outdoor kitchen with refrigeration, warming cabinets and cabinetry is more self-reliant, but will require more space and connections for gas, water, and electricity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are also outdoor kitchen appliance “kits” from companies like EP Henry. These include everything—the grill, cabinets, countertop, even bricks for the surrounding structure, plus a sink. Only experienced DIYers should put this combo together and will need to pull all the permits for construction and utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the location of a built-in kitchen, if you place it against an outer wall of your house, you won’t have to run water and gas lines as far as if you were to locate it some further distance within the yard. You will, however, likely need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/">ventilation hood to prevent cooking smells from drifting</a> into your house. Work with an experienced contractor who can help you maximize your budget by finding the best location for easy utility access. He or she will also be able to tell you if you need that vent hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Location (and climate) will also be a factor as to whether your outdoor kitchen grill station should be sheltered or exposed. Even appliances made for outdoor use shouldn&#8217;t be exposed to driving rain or snow, or prolonged, sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Always check to see if a permit is necessary before starting your outdoor kitchen project,” advises Russ. Your contractor can handle this, as he or she should be highly knowledgeable about local codes. These codes would include easement, permeable surface requirements, water restrictions, and height restrictions. Besides getting help with all those permits, learn about the other benefits of working with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed contractor</a> on your outdoor kitchen project.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing the right features</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outdoor kitchen can be as large and tricked out as your space and budget will allow, but to make it fully functional, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">outfit it like you do the indoor kitchen</a>, with designated areas for prep, cooking, and clean-up, as well as dining and hanging out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: The grill</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the center of any kitchen is the stove or, in this case, an outdoor kitchen grill.  Outdoors kitchen grills can be as sophisticated as you want, with two, three, or five burners, plus an accompanying warming drawer, side burners, and pizza oven. Confirm that whatever outdoor grill you choose is from an established manufacturer that specializes in grills and offers a solid warranty.  If you’re in the market for a freestanding outdoor kitchen grill, look at companies like KitchenAid, Dacor, and Monogram. These brands are known for their indoor cooking appliances, and also offer outdoor gas-operated products. Their outdoor products have modern combos of multiple burners and side grills, which let you cook several items simultaneously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturers devoted just to grills, like Weber, also offer plenty of choice for both freestanding and built-ins. Check that the area below the grill can handle the grill&#8217;s weight, and the heat it will emit, as well as any sparks that might fly out. The counter or workspace should be adjacent to the grill and burners. Make sure you can sanitize it for food preparation. “Keep a buffer zone between hot grills, ovens or cooktops and any people,” says Russ, who recommends a minimum of 9 inches of countertop extension behind and to the sides of all hot appliances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: A fridge or freezer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably don’t need a full-size fridge outside. An under-counter version will do the trick to chill protein until cook time, while keeping drinks cold. If you have the room, you could enjoy two fridges, one for food and one for beverages. The most common width for under-counter models is 24 inches, but 21- and 18-inch versions, as well as drawers, are available from major commercial fridge makers like Summit. Expect to pay $1,000 to $2,000 (for a double-drawer version)—as much as a grill. Make sure the model you buy is UL-listed and rated food-safe for outdoor use.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Sinks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sink, while not mandatory, makes outdoor entertaining much easier. You&#8217;ll be able to rinse hands and wash dishes, so you don’t have to take dirty dishes back into the house, or fill up a water pitcher. You&#8217;ll just need a water line connected to your home water supply, or a hook-up through a hose if you just need cold water. You’ll want weather-resistant 16-gauge stainless-steel for the sink. Then ask yourself, single or double basin? Splurge on a bar station that includes a sink, plus condiment trays, and an insulated ice bucket from Home Depot. Or, supplement your cook station with a modular side burner and sink combo from Master Forge. Wondering about a dishwasher? Demand is low so they are hard to find. Best to rinse dishes in that sink and cart the load to the house to finish inside.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outdoor kitchen appliances: Lighting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For comfort and aesthetics, outdoor lighting is a no-brainer. It’s also necessary for safety. As with the indoor kitchen, you want the prep and grill areas well-lit. Dining and seating areas can get by with softer, ambient lighting, but make sure pathways are lit so no one stumbles at night. Your contractor can help you determine the appropriate outdoor options for spotlights focused on task areas, as well as pendant, post, or string lighting to illuminate the dining and lounging areas, and lantern or path lighting for groundcover. Again, you want fixtures made to be operated outdoors, but look for LED versions. This option is preferable because LEDs give off little heat, can handle temperature swings from -40F to 180F, and last up to 10 years or for 100,000 hours of continuous use. You’ll find the widest range of selection at box stores where you can see the lights illuminated to help you decide if you like the effect.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Tip: Keep convenience within reach</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your contractor is running lines for utilities, ask them to include electrical outlets for small appliances, like a blender, portable stereo, and space heaters. Your contractor will know the correct type of outdoor outlets, which should be ground fault circuit interpreter (GFCI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooking on the grill is a great American pastime, whether entertaining friends or feeding your family. Maximize your enjoyment by adding some sizzle to al fresco dining with a beautiful, super-functional outdoor kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24658 mb-10 size-chrono" title="utility sink" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink-723x471.jpg" alt="utility sink" width="723" height="471" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink-723x471.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink-300x195.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink-600x391.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Utility_sink_Laundry_sink.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br /><span class="img-label"> <em>A utility sink like this one from American Standard can be functional and commercial-chic.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry room</a>, most of the thought goes into the washer and dryer. They do most of the hard work, right? And they are big purchase items. Nevertheless, there is one feature that, while it plays a supporting role, is indispensable: the utility room sink or laundry sink. Manufacturers are designing these basins specifically for the laundry room, offering many features with benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What distinguishes a utility sink from other sinks? They are extra deep to allow vigorous scrubbing or spraying of water with minimum splashing outside the basin. These sinks typically start at 10 inches and go up to as much as 25 inches deep versus a bathroom sink of six to eight inches deep. They come in a square or rectangular in shape, putting every inch of the basin to work. However, not all utility sinks are made alike. To determine the right choice, you&#8217;ll want to look at style and materials, taking into account what tasks will take place there and what sorts of cleansers or liquids the sink will be exposed to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Placement plays a factor in your decision, too. Keep the wet zone intact. The sink should be near the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/the-washing-machine-is-more-than-spin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer</a>—right next to it, if possible. This allows you to keep the plumbing lines together. It also means you can transfer soaked or pretreated items with a minimum of a drippy mess. The location may lock you into a particular size, and prevent you from getting that vintage double basin you had your eye on. That’s okay. Since a utility sink can come super deep, your choice will have the capacity to soak a grass-stained soccer uniform or a gravy-smeared tablecloth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the extra features available in some versions, such as a drainboard, or a second basin, you really can get a lot of use from it. Here’s what to consider before committing.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Choose your utility sink style</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with bathroom sinks, the laundry sink comes in a variety of styles for installation. What you choose from the list below has to do with personal taste, as well as any extras you may like.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wall-mount utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good option if you want to keep the floor area clear, as there is no need for a structure, such as a cabinet or legs attached to the bowl, to hold up the sink. You’ll find vintage designs, like white enamel-covered cast iron, from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.americanstandard-us.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Standard</a>. Cast iron is strong and it won’t dent, and the enameled finish resists scratches and chipping. <a href="//www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> offers a double basin that almost looks like a trough. <a href="https://www.elkay.com/us/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elkay</a> makes an institutional model out of stainless steel with a built-in drainboard.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Freestanding utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, this style stands on its own, supported by integrated or bolted-on legs or held in a washstand-style support of a stainless-steel frame with legs. You can find models with built-in drainboards as well. The advantage of this type of sink is its portability. You can move the entire unit wherever you want, even the garage, as long as you have a hookup to water. Like the wall mount style, the pipes are concealed, and you don’t have to replace a cabinet for support below.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-rimming or drop-in utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the simplest and thriftiest choice, this sink drops into a countertop and the sink is complete once the plumbing and faucet are hooked up. There’s no seam around the sink’s perimeter to catch grime.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Undermount utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good choice when you want a seamless, smooth appearance for your countertop. The sink rests below the counter surface and almost disappears.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Apron-front utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This style was popularized in country-style or vintage-style kitchens and the look carries over well to the laundry room. The apron front is nice for deflecting water splashes when you&#8217;re standing before the sink—much like an apron.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Agitator utility sink</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some personal items may be too small for the delicate cycle of your washer or require just a quick swish with detergent. <a href="https://mtibaths.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTI</a> makes a laundry sink with a micro-jet (like a whirlpool tub) that gently agitates the items for you.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is the best material for a utility room sink?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with style, the selection here is informed by personal taste. However, each material offers its own pluses.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stainless steel</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This material won’t stain. It also won’t chip or fade and has a little give, so anything you drop inside it—like a vase—is less likely to break than it will on enameled cast iron. All in all, a smart choice if you like the look of steel.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Enameled cast iron</strong></span></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enamel—a baked, powder-coated finish—coats cast iron, making it one of the strongest sinks available. This type of sink resists scratching, chipping, and staining. The enamel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives the super-rugged cast-iron surface a warmer-looking finish. Though impervious to water and resistant to stain, prolonged exposure to harsh bleach could blemish the surface. If you drop something hard on it, the enamel will chip or crack. It’s also the heaviest sink, so make sure it has sufficient support before you install it.</span></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Solid surfacing</strong></span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stain-resistant, durable, and warm in appearance, solid surfacing can stand up to a wide variety of tasks. Dings and scratches can be gently sanded out, but enlist a professional to do this, or the abraded surface will show. It can stain, too, despite some manufacturers’ claims, so best to use it for washing only.</span></p>
<h3>Adding a utility room sink to your home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits to a dedicated utility sink in the laundry room of your home. That said, washing machines come with gentle and delicate cycles, so despite all the conveniences, is a utility sink truly necessary? That’s why it’s called a utility sink; there are a lot of uses besides laundry. To name a few: handling cut flowers; potting plants; bathing a pet; washing dirty hands (or shoes) after garden or garage work; rinsing a mop; running water for crafts projects. You get the idea.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m so attached to the pedestal sink in my bathroom that I was a bit surprised when a client I&#8217;m working with requested a wood vanity cabinet for his bathroom. Why would someone want a vanity?</p>
<p>The most obvious reason is that vanities provide storage that we all need, especially in small New York City apartments. And even the simplest wood vanity adds warmth to a bathroom finished with tile floors and walls and ceramic fixtures. It makes the space feel less utilitarian and more like a real furnished room. Now, after doing a bit of research, I&#8217;m entirely convinced.</p>
<p>Designers sometimes repurpose old night tables and chest of drawers to serve as vanities. Conversely, a lot of vanities are designed to look like antique furniture. I like this kind of &#8220;themed&#8221; vanity in Powder Rooms or Guest Bathrooms, which aren&#8217;t used every day. Can you imagine using <a href="https://www.bathgems.com/" target="_blank">this vanity</a> everyday? I think it was once used by Napoleon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY TRADE WINDS EMPIRE" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4768146788_a83322bd45.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank">vanity</a> was made from an old Chinese trunk. It&#8217;s a dramatic, fantastic look that would look great in a discotheque.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY COLE AND CO CHINESE CHEST" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4767507037_9a3820def2.jpg" /></p>
<p>One trend now is to use &#8220;vessel sinks,&#8221; bowl-shaped sinks that rest on top of a vanity like a washbasin. I like these but water often splashes over the edge of the bowl and it constantly needs to be wiped down. But vessel sinks have a very pretty look, like this <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/onlinecatalog/detail.jsp?prod_num=2200" target="_blank">low, round sink</a> that&#8217;s set on a wood stand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY KOHLER BELL" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4767507175_607f6b5059.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of handsome, simple vanities. There&#8217;s the basic style with two wood doors below, the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd_192257-444-NR24-JVO_0_?productId=1226361&amp;Ntt=vanity%2024&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;Ns=p_product_price%7C0&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?Ntk=i_products$rpp=30$No=480$Ntt=vanity%2024$Ns=p_product_price%7C0$identifier=" target="_blank">platonic ideal</a> of vanity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd_192257-444-NC24D-JAV_0_?productId=1268663&amp;Ntt=vanity%2024&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;Ns=p_product_price%7C0" target="_blank">This simple one</a> has three stacked drawers. It&#8217;s straddles the line perfectly between traditional and modern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY LOWES JAVA CREST" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4767506231_07fe25f918.jpg" /></p>
<p>This pristine <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank">white wood vanity</a> would look perfect in a country home.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, there are a lot of Shaker-style vanities. <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/sagehill-designs-al2421-24-bathroom-vanity-cabinet-with-open-display-shelf-from-the-allure-collection/p1121879?source=gba%7C1121879&amp;CAWELAID=437563236" target="_blank">This one</a> has an open rack below for towels.</p>

<p>This terribly elegant vanity was inspired by Federalist style furniture. But it&#8217;s clean, fine, ladylike lines alos have a luxurious 30&#8217;s modern kind of style. I can imagine a very spirited and beautiful young woman a la Katherine Hepburn preening in front of this piece. I guess that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called vanities.</p>
