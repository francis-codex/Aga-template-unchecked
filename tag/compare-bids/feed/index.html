										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Check these boxes before hiring your contractor: experience, competitive bids, and support during your renovation</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" title="narrow-passageway-staircase" class="alignnone wp-image-49342 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4.jpg" alt="narrow passage way with staircase and white floor during renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sweeten_RefFriend-4-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="p3">What’s the best way to find a contractor for your renovation? Who will make the most trustworthy recommendation? It’s tempting to turn to friends and family, as you would when looking for a restaurant or babysitter. Before you decide to just use your friend&#8217;s general contractor, there are a few vital questions you should ask yourself. We outline these questions, with the possible pros and cons, in this guide.</p>
<h3 class="p3">How much experience is the friend/family recommendation based on?</h3>
<p class="p3">Has your friend done one renovation with this general contractor? Two? How are they able to compare their contractors to the dozens or hundreds who may serve your area?</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We benefit from the experience of over 2,000 successful home renovations. We’ve worked with hundreds of general contracting firms, many for several years. We also benefit from a founder and team members who are trained architects with extensive industry experience. We know how to evaluate general contractors!</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">How similar was their renovation to the one you’re planning?</h3>
<p class="p3">The best contractor for a bathroom remodel might not be the best choice for a full-house gut renovation. Similarly, the best contractor for build-only renovation may not be the best choice for one that requires design or architecture services.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors have performed every kind of renovation for every kind of home. We know every detail about the general contractors in our network: specialties, budget ranges, design services offered, experience in specific buildings, and even communication styles. We can match you with contractors who are perfectly equipped to succeed at your project.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">Will you get a competitive bid?</h3>
<p class="p3">Will your friend/family be able to recommend more than one contracting company? This is all that most non-professionals are able to offer. Unfortunately, without multiple contractors competing for your project, you’ll have no way of knowing if your bid is competitive—or even reasonable.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We match you with a curated shortlist of appropriate general contractors. We make it easy for you to connect with three or more, and to solicit bids from each. This allows you to make an informed choice, and to hire with confidence.</p>
<hr />
<h3 class="p3">Will you get expert support?</h3>
<p class="p3">You&#8217;ll probably have some questions. How do I prepare for a site visit? What should I ask each contractor? How do I get the most accurate bids? How do I compare bids that are organized differently and include different line items? What design or architecture services I’ll need?</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">We’ll happily answer all your questions. We even offer a call dedicated to comparing your bids. We don’t charge for any of these services.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What happens if something goes wrong during the renovation?</h3>
<p class="p3">If you use a friend&#8217;s general contractor, and the contractor turns out to be a problem, your friend/family will not be in a position to help.</p>
<h4 class="p3">Why Sweeten?</h4>
<p class="p3">With our vetting criteria in place, we start with prevention: all of our contractors have met <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our standards</a>—they’re fully insured, they meet all required state and local licensing requirements, and they’ve been in business long enough to earn solid reputations. We’ve interviewed them, interviewed their previous clients, and in many cases, we’ve been working with them for years.</p>
<p class="p3">In the unlikely event of a problem with your Sweeten general contractor that you can’t resolve on your own, we will step in and help.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Sweeten can help</h4>
<p class="p3">Sometimes you need your best friend … and sometimes you need a team of trained architects who have facilitated thousands of successful renovations and who offer financial protection.</p>

			<h2>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s needed to secure accurate bids for your project from general contractors</h2>

<h3>Connect with the right contractors to meet</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the start of a renovation project, meeting with several general contractors will be one of your first tasks. Make the most of your site visits by preparing as much information for your contractor to write up an estimate for the scope of work. To ensure you get accurate bids from those professionals, here are some points to begin a conversation with each contractor. Having a list of vetted and licensed general contractors is the first step on how to start a home renovation.</p>
<p>We can get you started by matching your project with <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contracting firms specifically for your remodel. For the right fit, these contractors will service your local area and have experience in your type of project. Schedule a phone conversation to narrow down your choices to a few and have three estimates to compare.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Jump on the phone first</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A site visit on your property with a potential contractor is crucial. It’s also time-consuming for both parties. Therefore, contractors recommend a phone call first to explore <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatibility and positive signs</a> of being a good fit. “I like to just go over the basic scope and get an idea of the budget. A call makes sure we are on the same page,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor P.J.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How far a contractor’s base is from your home is important to find out early on, according to Daniel Bawden of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). A two-hour commute for the contractor and team could slow down the project. Also, they may not be familiar with the local suppliers when additional material is needed. “Instead of four or five general contractors walking through your house, it is smarter to do a really good phone interview first,” Daniel said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Know your renovation budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps to have a ballpark figure of what you are willing to spend. That figure needs to be realistic and is key to how to start a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home renovation</a>. Sometimes online quote generators can give the wrong impression for the cost of the job as well as a timeline. There are many other aspects to take into account. “Real-world construction, especially getting permits, where every local jurisdiction is different, can vary so much,” said Connie Leipard from the National Association of Women in Construction. If you&#8217;re looking to work with a women-owned contracting firm, check out our five-part series on <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women contractors</a> in our network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get an idea of the average budget, these <a href="https://sweeten.com/remodeling-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remodeling cost guides</a> are based on geography for budget, mid-grade, and high-end <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen projects</a> and bathrooms. For example, a budget bathroom in New York City starts at $18,000, while a budget kitchen begins at $24,500. In Houston, expect a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mid-grade bathroom</a> to start at $24,500, and a mid-grade kitchen to begin at $35,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost of a bid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some general contractors will charge a few hundred dollars for a bid. Others charge an initial fee that gets deducted from the project total if a contract is signed with them, according to Daniel. Some, including Sweeten general contractors, don’t charge at all. Make sure the cost of a bid is discussed during the initial phone call.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Review your building’s alteration agreement</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For condos and co-ops, Sweeten contractor P.J. advised checking the requirements of your building’s alterations agreement early on. These agreements might stipulate what updating is required when your apartment undergoes a renovation. For example, it may instruct that the circuit panel or shut-off valves be replaced in your apartment regardless of the scope of work. Essentially, your renovation triggers the requirement that these items be updated. “These are rules meant to bring the apartment and the building up to current standards,” said P.J.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Gather your renovation ideas</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve nailed down a final list of general contractors, a meeting and a site visit to your property is scheduled. They don’t need to know everything about your renovation, but the more information you can give them the better. Visual aids are helpful whether they&#8217;re a rough sketch of what you want to full-blown blueprints drawn up by <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a designer or architect</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Images of your style and preferences<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>cabinets<strong>, </strong>flooring<strong>, </strong>faucets<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>go a long way. Inspirational images gathered on websites like Pinterest or blogs are a good start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A step beyond that is picking specific materials that you may want. When potential general contractors put together their bid, they often include approximate dollar figures for items like tile or cabinetry. This is commonly referred to as an &#8220;allowance,&#8221; since the material has not been chosen. These items can drastically vary in price depending on your final preference, according to Daniel. If you already have a good idea of what you want to use, the contractor can input more accurate costs rather than a guesstimate. “If material research and shopping have at least started, the renovation can begin sooner,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;There will be fewer delays because all of the product is in hand.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Will you be living there?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are not gut-renovating all at once, there’s a good chance you might opt to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stay in your home during the renovation</a>. The earlier you make a decision on this the better. The contractor can then factor into the bid if they need materials to separate you from the renovation, according to Connie. This becomes very important for older buildings that could have asbestos or lead issues. “You have to make a lot of preparation so that dust doesn’t get to the other end of the house, especially if there are children,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depending on the contractor and the scope of the project, it can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to prepare an accurate bid. </span><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

			<h2>Our free bid-leveling call helps translate contractor estimates</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/demo-site-architecture-floorplans.jpeg" alt="Demo site and how to compare remodeling estimates" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-56432 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/demo-site-architecture-floorplans.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/demo-site-architecture-floorplans-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/demo-site-architecture-floorplans-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key part of choosing a contractor for your renovation is how to compare remodeling estimates. At this point, you have interviewed contractors and received their proposals. Estimates can vary drastically in terms of look and format. However, all estimates should include at least two things: a detailed scope of work and a price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you compare them when one is five pages long while the other is just one? Or when one is grouped by room, and the other is grouped by task? A note on terminology: “bid,” “estimate,” and “proposal” refer to the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post your project and you’ll have access to our bid leveling services to help make sense of the various construction estimates in front of you, including both <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and non-Sweeten. </span></p>
<h3>How many contractor estimates should I get?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/white-ikea-high-gloss-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting at least three contractor bids</a>. This allows you to understand the price of the work. You’ll have a low, a medium, and a high bid and likely some differentiation in the services offered by the general contractors. Getting multiple estimates also gives you the chance to experience different personalities and communication styles. These are subjective factors important in your decision-making process. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great rapport with your general contractor</a> goes a long way in achieving a successful renovation.  </span></p>
<h3>Breaking down how to compare contractor bids</h3>
<h4>Similarities and differences in contractor estimates</h4>
<p>Even though bids may come in a variety of formats, major work categories (like demolition, plumbing, electrical, etc.) are usually called out specifically. To begin, find the biggest categories of work in each bid and see how those costs compare. You&#8217;ll get a sense of how your candidates are thinking about the work and the time/skill needed to complete it.</p>
<p>There may be spots where bids diverge significantly. Some categories may be in some estimates but not others.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the inclusion of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">skim coating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole apartment remodel</a> can increase the budget dramatically but not in all cases. One contractor may have included it, while another has not. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your site visits with individual contractors may include ideas or suggestions that didn’t come up with other candidates, making a line-by-line comparison even more challenging. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each contractor may vary slightly in their approach to completing the work. Avoid major discrepancies in scope by confirming the work that you would like to bid out after the visit. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Including your HOA requirements</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check to confirm any requirements for renovating with your co-op/condo board or HOA. Factors like site/hallway protection, access to parking and service elevators, and work hours can impact the efficiency of labor and therefore the price of the job.</span></p>
<h4>Post-site visit follow up</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should feel free to follow up with your candidates to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarify any particular costs</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">give them an opportunity to provide a price for an idea that may not have come up during your site visit</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">ask for their input on areas where taking another approach might help you achieve what you want at a lower cost</span></li>

<h3>How material choices factor into the bid</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assumptions are built into bids in different ways. Site visits give you a chance to meet with candidates and explain a broad overview of what you want to do. But if you don&#8217;t know the exact materials you plan to use, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-renovation-bids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors will provide “allowances”</a> or educated guesses about what you will choose to spend on the materials based on the finish level you discussed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might suggest you want very basic tiles, and out-of-the-box cabinets, nothing fancy. A general contractor might price with the assumption that you will buy budget-friendly materials. Or, you might suggest you want a luxurious countertop material and unique backsplash tiles to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recreate the kitchen</a>. The contractor might price assuming you’ll purchase mid-grade, high-end, or luxury materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for you to understand the assumptions underlying the allowances. Anything in excess of the allowances in the bid, you’ll have to pay for out of pocket. That said, some contractors leave allowances out altogether. It would be left to you to cost analyze within your <a href="https://sweeten.com/remodeling-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole remodeling budget</a>, plan for, and purchase your finished materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for places where major material purchases (and permits, if applicable) are or are not itemized in the pricing. Does it vary across bids? The goal here is not to negotiate a particular price down but to clearly compare your options. Don’t walk away from a great contractor because a price that looks high specifies materials that aren’t included in another bid. Get clarity on assumptions about materials before you make your decision so you aren’t surprised when it comes time to buy items that weren’t in the bid.</span></p>

<h3>How Sweeten&#8217;s bid-leveling call helps you</h3>
<h4>Sweeten walks you through how to compare contractor bids</h4>
<p>At this point in the pre-renovation process, you’ve <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted your project</a> and met all of your contractors. You should have three or more estimates (from both Sweeten and non-Sweeten contractors).</p>
<p>To get a clearer understanding of the bids, set up a 30-minute call with us on how to compare contractor bids. This call can be extremely helpful in learning more about each contractor and deciding <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/sage-green-kitchen-remodel-in-kips-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who suits your project best</a>.</p>
<h4>Answers the questions you’re afraid to ask</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most importantly, Sweeten renovators have reported that the call was a chance to ask all the questions they were afraid to ask, including construction terminology. Homeowners felt more comfortable making a decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prep: Prior to your scheduled call, share the bids you’ve received and are considering—including from contractors who are not affiliated with our network. We will review the bids prior to the call and come prepared to share our observations. </span></p>
<h4>Get the inside scoop on Sweeten’s recommended contractors</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work closely with our contractors and can share our experience working with the recommended contractors.  Once we understand your goals, preferences, and feedback, we can weigh in on who we think could be a good fit in terms of collaboration, style, and services offered. We can also discuss how they performed for other Sweeten homeowners during their renovations.</span></p>

<h4>Discuss best practices for hiring and kicking off construction</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s good to reflect on general best practices before choosing a firm, signing a contract, and starting construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can discuss some of the things you should be thinking about and asking about at this point in the process. For example, getting to a place where you are really comfortable with the scope of work document and draft contract, what is included and excluded, and what the process for a change order is if that arises during construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can coach you on next steps and follow-up questions you should ask your general contractor. Our goal on this call is to help you lay the groundwork for an excellent partnership with your general contractor. It will set you up for a satisfying renovation process in addition to a great finished product!   </span></p>
