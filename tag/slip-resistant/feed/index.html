										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Whether granite slabs or a full-on marble bathroom, natural stone offers durability, resistance to bacteria, and the flexibility to match every style</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20725 size-chrono" title="natural stone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg" alt="natural stone" width="723" height="496" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Laura and Peter&#8217;s bathroom features <a href="https://Sink, shower, wall and floor tiles in marble shower" target="_blank">floor-to-ceiling marble</a>, including radiant heat flooring</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">When it comes to the bathroom, nothing says luxury like real stone. Covering a wide price range, it makes it an easy go-to when designing the bath space. </span><span class="s1">Greater accessibility to quarries, wider distribution, and competition from dealers have all made this possible. An impervious (or nearly) surface also makes it suitable for almost every surface from walls, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floors</a>, countertops, and tub surrounds. Not all natural stone is alike, however. Some are more durable than others but with thoughtful attention to use and placement, you can enjoy this classic material in the bath. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choosing real stone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Typically, the most common reason to choose one stone over another is to achieve a specific aesthetic,” says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank">Sweeten contractor Phil</a>. “There are just some specific nuances that people look for that can only be found in a specific stone.”</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b></b>The most popular choice for stone in the bath is marble, thanks to its timeless appearance. Before you make your decision, consider other natural elements each with their own distinctive qualities. </span><span class="s1">Granite, travertine, and slate are all hard stones that hold up well to water in the bath, and each offers a particular look. Shop around as every slab is unique.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Think about where you would like to see it used. Will it be used to cover vertical and horizontal surfaces, or as an accent? If you’re working with a strict budget, you can enjoy a small application of stone, as a border around porcelain tile or behind the sink, or as a slab for the countertop. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Marble</span></span><span class="s2"> <b><br />
</b></span><span class="s1">A classic and versatile option, marble works in both traditional and contemporary settings. Distinguished by rich veins, it comes in many shades of white, as well as subtle grays, pale gold, and black. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Among the most popular are the white marbles: Calacatta and Carrara. The veins on Calacatta tend to be bolder than those on Carrara. Calacatta Gold, as its name indicates, includes gold-colored flecks. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Crema Marfil offers a creamier tone, almost like ivory. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Bardiglio is a deep gray stone with a blend of paler gray and black veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Nero Marquino is a black marble with white veins. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">All of these marbles take a polished or matte finish. On a floor, use a matte surface or a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank">mosaic</a>. The smaller pieces, with lots of grout lines, help prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Marble is one of the more porous materials. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it. Ask the fabricator to recommend a sealant product. “Homeowners can seal stone themselves, and there are many easy-to-use solutions on the market,” says Phil. Seal the stone first when it’s installed, and twice a year or so. “The frequency can vary due to use and location,” he says. </span><span class="s1">If you use it in the bath, be prepared to seal it several times a year, and you may have to tackle mildew if you place it in your shower pan, where water is likely to hit it daily.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Granite</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>For many years, granite was a favorite countertop for kitchens. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder than most stones and nonporous so it can take moisture in the bath.</span> The pattern tends to be more granular than marble making it easier to coordinate with other designs. It comes in many more colors—whites, grays, and browns, as well as blues, greens, and reds. Install it as a slab as a countertop, or if you want to go all the way, apply slabs to the walls and tiles on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Travertine</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>Like marble, travertine conjures luxury. Think ancient monuments and historic buildings (Sacré Coeur in Paris). The surface pattern combines subtle veins and fine granular patterns for a rustic look. Honed or tumbled finishes soften the effect. Colors range from cream or ivory to earthier golds and browns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2">Slate</span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b>A fine-grained stone, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank">slate</a> comes in variations of blues, greens, browns, and grays for an elegant yet rustic look. When finished, it’s not as smooth as marble or granite. This makes it more naturally slip-resistant but still needs to be sealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Check for variations<br />
</b></span><span class="s1"><b><b><br />
</b></b></span>Stone is mined from a quarry, not manufactured, so each piece is unique. Color can vary by a lot, so if purchasing stone tile, ask to see the identification on all the boxes and be sure they go together. Buy an extra box in the case of repairs so the replacement tiles match.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Choose the finish</b></span></p>
<p>Marble and granite can take many different finishes—polished, honed, tumbled. There are a couple of new finish treatments called “leather” and “flamed” that polish the surface to a matte effect while playing up some of the grain.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Caring for your floors</b></span></p>
<p>Every natural stone requires sealing before it is installed and then periodically afterward. Frequency depends on the stone type and the amount of traffic received. If your bath sees activity every day, particularly from shoes, put down an area rug to catch grit and scuffs. Make sure the rug is rubber-backed so it doesn’t slip.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Consider the pros and cons</b></span></p>
<p>If you want natural, unique surfaces in the bath, stone makes a great choice.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• It resists water, bacteria, odor, and fire. Wet areas, like the shower, will require </span><span class="s1">a waterproof membrane underneath. Factor in regular maintenance, such as sealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• As hard as stone is, it’s also at risk from scratching, so lift furniture instead of sliding it, and sweep regularly to remove grit.  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Cracking can occur without proper installation, so make sure your contractor prepares an even subfloor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• <span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing a damaged area can be difficult and costly. This is particularly true if the area is large. Play it safe with tiles or mosaic on the floor, where damage, if any, is more likely to occur from a dropped item. The smaller-sized tile and mosaics make it easier to replace a piece or two.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">• Naturally cool, the material is a bonus in summer, but not so nice in winter on bare feet. Since natural stone transmits heat well, installing radiant heating before the tile is set may be a nice perk.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>Faux stone and alternatives</b></span></p>
<p>With the recent refinements in high-definition printing, the look of stone is convincingly reproduced in porcelain tile. Porcelain is fired with a glaze making it impervious to water and less likely to scratch. This means it doesn’t have to be sealed regularly. At 3/8-inch thick, it’s also thinner and lighter than stone. The lighter weight makes it cheaper to ship, bringing down the cost.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Check out quartz, like Dekton and Caesarstone. This man-made material incorporates finely ground stone in a high-pressure manufacturing process to produce a surfacing material that is as hard as the real thing and claims to be impervious to stains </span><span class="s1">from liquids like wine and cooking oils. This super-hard quality requires less maintenance than real stone and contributes to the recent growth in popularity of quartz. Because it is a man-made material, you have more control over the appearance. </span><span class="s1">Manufacturers offer faux stone looks as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and colors, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Stone in the bath is an investment of time and money. Your payback is a unique yet timeless look that, with a little attention to regular maintenance, will afford you with a room that you can enjoy for your lifetime.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>

<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
