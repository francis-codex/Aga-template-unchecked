<h3>Revamping a dated, bland small kitchen in Queens</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28605 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;">Deva and Sam&#8217;s small kitchen in Queens functioned just fine. It was also incredibly bland with a floor at the tail end of its lifespan. “We wanted the kitchen to feel bright&#8230;to be modern and clean, but in a way that wouldn’t feel quickly dated,” said Deva. The couple saw the storage potential in the hallway connecting the kitchen to the rest of the apartment. The two Ikea butcher blocks they had there were only handy for additional food preparation space; with no power outlets nearby, a long, awkward extension cord was needed to plug in the coffee machine. But, after living in the apartment for six months, what really motivated them to renovate was getting that life-changing mechanical device called a dishwasher. Sam and Deva often have friends over for dinner on Friday night, which meant piles of dirty dishes that hung around for half the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28602 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Adding functionality to a small Queens kitchen in a cost-effective way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize the space, Deva and Sam spent a lot of time measuring their kitchen. “We didn’t want to change the footprint too much in order to stay on budget,” said Sam. One problem area was the refrigerator, which ate up plenty of cabinet and counter space while casting a shadow over the oven. Their contractor, who they found through Sweeten, suggested <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving it to a corner</a>. “It was hard to picture at first,” said Deva, but concluded, “it was absolutely the right choice.” The hallway now features extra outlets where the coffee machine sits full-time along with drawer storage for other countertop appliances. Their formal dishes—previously stowed in storage—are now showcased in new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass-front cabinets</a> above. The couple also tried to keep all their appliances both cost- and environmentally conscious. In the end, due to the new layout, they had to bring in a smaller stove but were able to keep their refrigerator.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28606 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen and dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28603 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28607 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hiccup occurred when a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op policy</a> caught Deva and Sam off-guard. As they were renovating, they were required to replace their old 1940s fuse box with a modern circuit breaker. That, in turn, meant they had to rewire much of the apartment. And that became Deva&#8217;s best advice to renovators: “Know what your co-op board requires, in detail, before you get started.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28604 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sam_Kitchen-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation queens ny" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: A friend was renovating her kitchen around the same time and gave Deva and Sam her old dishwasher. The only catch was it needed to be picked up. While the couple was struggling to maneuver it into the passenger seat of their car (because it didn’t fit in the trunk), a stranger jumped in to help. “He simply said ‘My kid’s in the car, and I want him to know that when someone’s having trouble, you help them,&#8217;” recalled Deva.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24030 size-chrono" title="Induction cooktop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf-723x510.jpg" alt="Induction cooktop" width="723" height="510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf-600x424.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SM_CI365TF_PIK_122116_subzero_wolf.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a>Photo: Sub-Zero/Wolf</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much talk today about creating a “smart home”—since the kitchen is usually the busiest room of the house, it has the opportunity to be the most intelligent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choices for kitchen appliances are driven by how the cookspace is used on a daily basis, what minimizes labor, and what cuts down cooking time. Take into consideration the steam oven cooking 3x faster or the dishwasher that packs more in a single cycle. Whether you are a gourmet chef or simply someone who likes good meals with minimal effort, the following features will help you to work smarter in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combination convection-steam oven</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to consumers’ desire for healthy meals that can be prepared in shorter-than-usual times comes the steam-assist oven. Usually combined with a convection feature, this oven circulates air for more even cooking and emits steam for juicier results with meat, chicken, and fish. Together, these functions can also reduce cooking time by as much as a third to a half, and that means a lower energy bill. This oven is great for reheating food the next day without drying it out. If you don’t want to commit to the triple-thousand-dollar price tag or switch out your present oven at the moment, there are countertop versions available from companies like Cuisinart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Induction cooktop</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not brand new to the scene, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank">induction</a> continues to innovate, ensuring its place in the working-smart kitchen appliances category. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Precision cooking</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Induction works by connecting to the size of the pan, heating only where it’s needed. This reduces energy waste from an open gas flame or an exposed electrical element that emits heat outside of its center of contact. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay safe</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area around the cooking zone also stays relatively cool, as opposed to electric coils or the grate above a gas burner. So you don’t have to worry about an accidental burn. Look for added safety features such as automatic turnoff in the case of extreme heat or if a cooking zone operates for a particularly long time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save time</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some manufacturers, like Thermador, offer an induction cooktop with memory, so if you move a pan to another area of the surface, all the programmed settings will be transferred to the new location of the pan, eliminating the need to re-jigger that perfect heat adjustment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Fridges with climate-controlled compartments </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication centers that take and send messages, and software that stores and transmits recipes are getting a lot of attention right now, but one factor remains constant: among the top complaints homeowners have for their refrigerators is food waste. Not that it’s the fridge’s fault, but the greater the capacity—and capacity is a major factor in selection—the more likely the cucumbers will get shoved to the back of the drawer, only to be discovered when they have become a slimy mess. To answer this, manufacturers have fine-tuned climate control with drawers that include dedicated convertible temperature settings so the cheese stays fresh and the lettuce crisp in their neighboring compartments. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refrigerator drawers such as those from Fisher &amp; Paykel offer subtle climate control for maximum flexibility when you toggle between the need for extra fridge or freezer space, or even to perfectly chill wine for a party.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24091 size-chrono" title="dishwasher" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-723x542.jpg" alt="dishwasher" width="723" height="542" /></a>Photo: Bosch<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bosch_079_rev3_PAGE_1C_jw_v12-noglow-e1495678384366.jpg" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Third-rack dishwasher</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the operation of a dishwasher is surely a science, the loading of the dishwasher is something of an art. The range of contents—dishes, pans, flatware, mixing bowls, hinged utensils—can require imagination and strategy to place them effectively for the best wash. With the addition of a third rack that can be adjusted to customize loads, many of those odd and oversized items, like sheet-cake pans and serving trays, can be cleaned at the same time as a complete load of dinner dishes, saving time, electricity, and water. Another option: twin removable trays that can be positioned to allow long-stemmed wine glasses on one side while stowing all the flatware in a rack atop the salad bowls on the other.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hands-free faucet</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have two options here: a motion sensor in the shank of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-trends-kitchen-faucets/" target="_blank">faucet</a> that detects the wave of a hand to turn on the water, or a touch-sensitive version that operates with gentle pressure from the back of the wrist or elbow. The benefit is time (and water) saved in clean-up since you don’t have to wash down the handles repeatedly during the course of preparing a meal.</span></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Take your smart kitchen one step further with a seamless, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank">integrated design</a> to keep your space clutter and chaos free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Make a Brooklyn kitchen feel inviting</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snug like a ship, a galley kitchen will maximize function in the smallest of spaces. Renovating an efficient galley layout can be as simple as upgrading appliances, lighting, and architectural details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The room was earth-toned and hardly the apartment owner’s style. Its dated ceramic floor tile was a drab-looking tan and had been laid with wide grout joints that collected dirt. An uninspired backsplash with ugly, inexpensive accent tiles came down onto a counter that looked like mud-speckled granite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The owners love cooking and entertaining, so they worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to remodel not just for function but also to make the kitchen more welcoming. Walls have been brightened with white paint, as has the old radiator cover beneath the window. New white cabinets are taller than the former ones, and a small soffit conceals the leftover space above, simplifying the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisp white subway tile updates the backsplash, and floor tiles were replaced with resilient material. Under-cabinet lighting supplements new halogen track lighting in the center of the ceiling. The stainless steel stove has a stainless combination hood-and-microwave above, and the new dishwasher is a pleasant addition. Cabinets now surround an efficient stainless french-door fridge; its freezer drawer conserves the cool air that otherwise would be lost when you open the door of a side-by-side model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a bonus, creative space planning allowed the owners to repurpose an adjacent windowed alcove as a second bedroom.</p>
