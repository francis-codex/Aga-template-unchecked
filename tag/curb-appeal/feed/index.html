<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A ranch-style Georgia home with appeal</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We bought this 1958 home in Atlanta’s Buckhead section with plans to renovate right away. Nothing was wrong, per se, but we knew we wanted to remodel. The plan was to improve the layout and exterior façade and update the kitchen and bathrooms. A big project would also turn the primary bedroom into a true master suite.</span></p>
<div></div>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg" alt="Den with fireplace, couches, chairs, grand piano, and hanging fan" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are Jenna and Hagan, now parents to two daughters: Clay, 2, and Sloan, 7 months. Henry, our dog, lives here, too. When we found the house, we were still expecting our second child and I was working from home due to the pandemic. More space and some rooms to relax in were all we could think about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>A mid-century remodel focused on good bones with potential</b></span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our ranch-style home, in the Chastain Park neighborhood, comprises 3,000 square feet. It has a backyard with mature trees, and the house benefits from pretty views and lots of natural light. The interior was traditionally styled, and we liked it. We felt, however, that we could make it work better for our family, and set out to do that. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and the team quickly sourced four quality contractors for us to consider. We soon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6751#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a general contractor</a> who inspired our confidence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg" alt="A view of the white painted brick fireplace from behind the tan couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52192" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg" alt="The grand piano in the renovated den with a large plant" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52191" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We brought floorplans to our meetings, as layout changes were the most challenging part of the project. Our house had a lot of storage space that we saw a potential to put to better use. These would include the bedroom areas as well as more useful spaces for the kitchen area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the den, our contractor removed a large built-in shelf that had started to separate from the wall. We also painted this room and stained the floor dark brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg" alt="View into the two doors to the living areas from the entryway" width="1000" height="1545" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-194x300.jpg 194w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-20-583x900.jpg 583w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;The contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A new bay window brightens the kitchen</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The plan for the kitchen included putting in a bay window in the existing breakfast nook and installing Dolomite marble countertops. We ordered a new kitchen sink and added a subway tile backsplash. We kept the existing cabinets, switching out the knobs for a fast refresh. To increase function in this section of the house, we turned to old closets. Opening up the boxed-in space of the four lining the back hallway made space for a butler’s pantry with a second fridge. We also built a laundry room in this area in a follow-up to the larger renovation. </span></p>

<h3>Transforming closets for a master suite</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the back of the house, closets (again) and one of the offices gave their square footage to enlarge our master suite and another bedroom. For the master suite, we imagined a large, open bedroom area looking out into the backyard. We would also add a walk-in closet, a big bathroom, and a powder room. The remap worked brilliantly. An existing door was repurposed as a sliding barn door and leads to our master walk-in closet. The contractor built a secret door at its back that lets us quickly get to the kids’ bedrooms during the night. It has come in handy!</span></p>

<h3 class="p4">Three bathrooms with new tile</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations came next. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-save-on-home-remodeling-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We did them economically</a>—as in almost simultaneously. Each bath got new tile, though we retained usable fixtures and hardware</span><span class="s1"> where we could. At one point, we had three bathrooms torn up. The one in use had a shower only, and our two-year-old was terrified of showers! We were pleased when the child’s bathroom, replete with new tub and penny tile floor, was finished—not to mention the other three. Our beautiful master bath, with a freestanding fluted bathtub, a glass-walled shower, and double sinks got the full marble treatment. The color palette was a mix of gray and white, including sleek large-sheet floor tiles</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg" alt="Bathroom with light blue walls, white floors, white shower curtain, and decorative mirror" width="1000" height="668" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52186" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/71023-Hagan-Home-15-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Whole-house improvements for curb appeal</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Much of the house had hardwood flooring in need of refinishing. From the bedrooms to the living room, den, foyer, and kitchen, the contractors sanded and stained them. In another global redo, the contractor replaced the windows top to bottom to improve insulation. We could see early signs of rotting wood in the old windows. The new kitchen bay window </span><span class="s1">looks great from the inside and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/curb-appeal-goes-a-long-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhances the home’s curb appeal</a>. The house would also get a new coat of exterior paint. </span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A Sweeten general contractor to count on</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Through it all, our Sweeten contractor was reliable and competent. He was diligent with the permitting process, a delay-ridden challenge during Covid. (Key takeaway: Be 100 percent sure you need a permit and factor it into your timeline!) Our contractor was transparent on costs, and his efforts resulted in a pleasing final product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">It’s been a feat, but finally, we feel settled. Jenna and I waited so long for our master suite—it feels magical to have our own space. The girls, and Henry the dog, are happy. We are home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First impressions make lasting impressions, and this is as true of your home as it is of anything else in life. Let’s begin with the front door. It’s the focal point of your entry and the feature upon which pretty much everything else hinges—literally. You can go dramatic or understated, but you want a door that works with the style of your house while also keeping it secure and free from drafts. The right choice will set you well on your way to the kind of curb appeal that also gives a boost to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-is-home-equity-and-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the value of your home</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s plenty to consider when selecting from front door styles. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers a rundown of front door styles—materials, colors, accessories, and add-ons—to help you navigate the process.</p>
<h3>When should you upgrade a front door?</h3>
<p>In short: security, energy efficiency, and good looks. The appropriate door performs on many levels. It’s also a good investment. The National Association of Realtors advises that homeowners can expect as much as an 80 percent return on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">window and door upgrades</a> at closing. If you’re not moving, this enhancement makes you a better neighbor and a happier homeowner with a prettier front entrance. Prices across front door styles can range from $200 up to $2,000+ if you add on sidelights, transoms, or different finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also seize the opportunity to upgrade security with a newer, more secure lock system. Additionally, you could also get an energy-efficient door that reduces air leakage and cuts your utility costs!</p>
<h3>Finding your front door style</h3>
<p>The choice is yours, and you can have whatever you want—windows or a solid panel, sidelights, or a transom. To maximize curb appeal, you should stick with a door that fits with the architecture of your home. Today’s houses, especially new construction, can often be a hybrid that includes features from different eras. For example, you&#8217;ll see Tudor plus French Revival, or Spanish Colonial plus Craftsman. Consult with a professional (an architect, your contractor, or a door company sales rep) who has experience pairing the right door with a particular house style. You can also research architectural home styles online, like on manufacturers’ websites, and compare what you find with your home. <a href="https://www.thermatru.com/inspiration/doorways-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therma-Tru Doors offers the DoorWays app</a>, which allows you to try out different doors on an image of your own front entrance.</p>

<h3>Front door systems and configurations</h3>
<p>You’ll find that entry doors are often referred to as “door systems.” This means they come pre-hung in a frame and pre-drilled for both doorknob and deadbolt, not just a mere rectangular slab. The system should also include the door’s bottom edge, which interlocks with the threshold. It will also likely have weather stripping encircling the door’s perimeter. This setup is convenient and sensible. This way, you purchase all the door features from one manufacturer to ensure everything functions well together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re replacing an existing door, you will want it to be the same size as the previous one, unless you are taking apart the entire entryway for a dramatic change. Changing the dimensions of the door (like adding sidelights or a transom) involves reframing the opening. For this type of involved job, you want to work with a general contractor. Before committing to a particular door, consult with your own contractor to ensure the door will fit. (Do this before it is paid for and delivered!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other terms you’ll encounter are “flush” and “paneled.” Flush doors are flat and smooth on both faces. Paneled doors have rectangular recesses framed by horizontal rails and vertical stiles. Originally, panel construction was meant to minimize cracking and warping on wood doors. They do this by giving the panels room to shift with changes in humidity. The “look” caught on, and it can now be found in other door materials. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>Front door material choices</h3>
<p>When you see the word “door,” you may automatically think “wood.” However, there’s more to materials nowadays, including fiberglass, steel, and wood composites. In each of these categories, doors are typically made of more than one material. Other materials are incorporated to enhance stability and energy efficiency. A wood door may have a steel interior, a steel door may have a wood exterior, a fiberglass door may have a wood frame—all for stability and strength—and most will have some type of foam insulation to fill the interior voids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the materials has its pros and cons, and the versatility to achieve different styles, configurations, and finishes, including the look of woodgrain.</p>
<h4>Fiberglass front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fiberglass doors are a practical choice for most climates, particularly harsh or humid weather. They resist wear and tear extremely well. Available in smooth or embossed woodgrain texture, they can mimic the look of wood and take paint or stain. These doors are dent-resistant, require little maintenance, and typically come with a long warranty, from 20 years to a limited lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Can crack under severe impact.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $1,500</p>
<h4>Steel front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Steel doors are positioned as the strongest of doors. They will not crack or warp. Coated with a baked-on polyester finish, steel doors will require periodic repainting. Higher-end versions come with a vinyl finish for greater weather resistance. Some manufacturers offer a wood veneer or wood composite coating that can be stained.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Not as weather-resistant as fiberglass or wood doors. They are easy to dent, and dings are hard to fix. Scratches on steel doors may rust if not treated promptly. In extremely high temperatures, the surface can be hot to the touch.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Both steel and fiberglass doors should come with a thermal break that separates the inside and outside door skins. This prevents the transfer of outdoor heat and cold, which can cause frost to form on the inside surface.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $2,000</p>
<h4>Wood front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fans of wood front doors are drawn to its heritage of warmth and the versatility of different species. Wood resists cold and heat. Some wood doors are composed of veneer skin over an engineered wood core. This protects the core from moisture that causes shrinking, swelling, and warping. It’s also the least likely material to dent, and scratches are easy to repair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Solid doors can be made through a millwork shop, lumberyard, and some door manufacturers, but they are expensive and time-consuming to complete. They also require regular upkeep—painting or varnishing to maintain their appearance—and a protected area in the shade or under an overhang.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $175 &#8211; $2,600</p>
<h3>Decorative details for front doors</h3>
<p>The hardware—hinges, door handle—are practical, while also complementing your door style. Manufacturers will offer further options for customization with decorative glass, grilles, metal trim, and clavos (AKA, decorative door studs). Sidelights and/or a transom also lend visual interest while letting in more light. There’s plenty of choice within the glass category, too—clear, rain, satin, and geometric to name a few. And don’t forget the door knocker, even if you have a doorbell!</p>
<h3>Front door styles: Colors to consider</h3>
<p>A contrasting or complementary door color adds a touch of wit and drama to the entry. Try matching it to the window frames or shutters, if you have them, for a truly coordinated look. Or just go for it with one bold color for the door. Many manufacturers offer color as part of the door selection process, which saves you the trouble of painting. These finishes are formulated to be fade-resistant, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Picking the right front door can feel like a big commitment, and it is. But as with all the right relationships, it’s one that you can depend on and enjoy for many years.</p>
