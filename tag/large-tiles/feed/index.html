<h3>Making old bathrooms new again</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this Chicago homeowner, updating her bathrooms was important. Plus, time was of the essence: she was living in the 1,500-square-foot condo in Bucktown (located on the northwest side of the city) and wanted to sell. However, she knew that putting some money into refreshing the place with a renovation would <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the resale value</a>. So, that’s exactly what she did. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned her attention to the primary and hall bathrooms since they were the biggest concern. They felt outdated, with an early 2000s brown-hued vibe. (A well-designed, new bathroom is one of the top aspects that appeal to potential homebuyers.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not the homeowner’s first time renovating and knew a good general contractor would make all the difference. She posted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and found a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in her area</a> who was in sync with her goals.  </span></p>
<h3>A more modern aesthetic to appeal to buyers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Size-wise, the homeowner was in luck. The primary bath had plenty of square footage and just needed some TLC to make it more attractive and functional. The hall bath would be a straightforward rip-and-replace, with no plumbing moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with her Sweeten general contractor, the homeowner focused on sourcing and buying materials and accessories. She wanted to redesign the bathroom with similar features that other new properties in her area were featuring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-1.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with bench and marble tiles on walls and recessed shelves and glass door in Buckstown resale renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47484" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first: get rid of the old jet tub. Although seen as a luxury in the early 2000s, the jet tub now seemed outdated. Plus, it was awkwardly placed next to a shower stall. To help the flow and the look of the bath, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower replaced this configuration</a>. The trend of large-format tile perfectly suited the new oversized shower. Two niches inlaid with hexagonal tile brought a nice contrast to the stacked wall tiles. And, of course, a new primary bath wouldn’t be complete without a long bench. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg" alt="double vanity sink with marble countertop and walk in shower in Buckstown resale renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47486" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vanity also got a much-needed refresh. Another double sink version replaced it, but one with a more modern aesthetic. She updated the hardware and matched the finishes to the overhead sconces. The contractor installed a quartz countertop along with a new backsplash. “It looks great,” says the homeowner. “Bigger, brighter, and more modern.”</span></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span class="img-label"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-47485 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-01.jpg" alt="hall bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></span></p>
<p>The hallway bathroom&#8217;s rip-and-replace received all-new fixtures and materials from tile, tub, and toilet to lighting and sink vanity.</p>
<p>All in all, the renovation took approximately five weeks, but then COVID hit Chicago, which curtailed the homeowners&#8217; plan to sell. Luckily, the renovation still <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resale value</a> of her home. She&#8217;s also hopeful that once things settle down, buyers will consider the new baths a real <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling point</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“[My contractor] was super helpful and responsive.”</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the overall renovation experience? “[My contractor] was super <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful and responsive</a>,” she says. “He really went out of his way to help make the process easier and save us money, including picking up all the materials we purchased at Home Depot to avoid delivery fees.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Tip from the Contractor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> The general contractor recommends having all your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials either already selected or ordered</a> so you don’t experience delays. Contractors work within a detailed timeframe. Make sure you have your materials on hand to help avoid delays and frustration for all involved. </span></p>
