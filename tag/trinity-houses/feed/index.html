										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Read up on licensed general contractors in Philly, the EZ Permit system, and historical landmarks</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49252 mb-24 size-full" title="Philadelphia historic homes" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled.jpg" alt="philadelphia rowhouse remodel" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/18505-Nel-House-11-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" />(<em>Above</em>) &#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kingston Ko for Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/trinity-home-renovation-philadelphia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nel&#8217;s rowhouse</a> in Bella Vista</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two cities are exactly the same when it comes to renovating, and this absolutely the case for Philadelphia. As one of the oldest municipalities in the U.S., Philadelphia&#8217;s individuality can be seen in its broad mix of housing types. According to Sweeten founder and CEO, Jean Brownhill: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Philadelphia has a unique architectural mix, from historic rowhouses and trinities to modern condos.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>However, with a unique housing supply comes a unique set of rules and regulations. Philly homeowners considering remodeling should be aware of these before starting a project. In this guide, Sweeten outlines what to know about renovating in this historic city: upsides, challenges, and remodeling tips specific to the region.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">In Philadelphia, a licensed general contractor can file your permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike New York, where an engineer or architect must file building permits, a licensed general contractor can do the job in Philly. If a contractor files the permit, actually the most likely scenario here, the contractor will need a commercial activity license and a contractor&#8217;s license from the City of Philadelphia. A contractor license requires a certificate of insurance, at least one supervising employee to have completed OSHA 30 training and a tax clearance form, which proves the contractor filing the building permit application does not owe the city any money. (If they are in debt to the city—i.e. with taxes—the application will be rejected.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a contractor is doing more than $500 worth of work for you, they will need a contractor’s license. Why is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a general contractor with </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the wise choice? (Well, the easy answer is: it would be illegal not to have one!) But it’s also for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your project, as it ensures the contractor <a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-licenses-and-inspections/permits-and-certificates/contractor-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knows how to run a safe worksite</a> and has adequate insurance.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-point screening process</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sweeten makes sure any contractor in its network not only has a license, but also has experience with your type of project and budget parameters, and is local. To check if there’s a Sweeten contractor near you, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click </a></span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></em></p>
<h3>Smaller Philadelphia remodeling jobs may qualify for EZ Permits</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other cities might require building plans for even the smallest jobs, Philly doesn’t. The city’s </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/services/permits-violations-licenses/apply-for-a-permit/building-and-repair/get-permits-without-plans-ez-permits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EZ Permits </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">system allows some building, electrical, and plumbing permit applications involving single-family homes to be submitted without plans. Projects that get the EZ Permits go-ahead include installing flooring, replacing roof coverings, putting in certain pools and spas, or adding a rear deck that is less than 216 square feet. (Take note: any buildings on the <a href="https://www.phila.gov/departments/philadelphia-historical-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Historical Registry</a> will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> qualify for EZ Permits, regardless of the project’s scope.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your project does not fall under EZ Permits, and the budget exceeds $25,000, three sets of building plans must be submitted—all signed and sealed by a design professional registered in the state of Pennsylvania. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Structural Design Criteria </span><a href="https://business.phila.gov/media/structural_design_criteria.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also required if your renovations are substantial, such as moving a load-bearing wall and reframing windows and doors.</span></p>
<h3>Are you renovating a landmark or in a historic district in Philadelphia?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you purchased a landmarked home in need of TLC, the city’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical Commission</span> has strict regulations to follow. Y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou most likely already know if your home is a landmark or in a historic district. But if you want to double-check, </span><a href="https://www.phila.gov/historical/register/Pages/RegisterofHistoricPlaces.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you altering the outside of your home (the roof, back, sides, and/or front)? In that case, your historic home project will need the blessing of the commission. This is different from other cities, where only renovations on the street-facing facade of a historic building are subject to additional approvals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your project involves a historic home in Philly, then a general contractor, engineer, or architect who has some experience working with the Historic Commission will be very helpful. (This will come in handy, as they will likely be filing the paperwork!)</span></p>
<h3>Tips for renovating Philadelphia&#8217;s rowhouses</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pride of the city&#8217;s real estate is its rowhouses. The side-by-side homes are more numerous than any other building type in the city. Many are now multi-family housing units. One common type of rowhouse is the three-story trinity, (tiny, three-story homes built for factory workers in the 1700s). You&#8217;ll also see larger, Victorian-style rowhouse structures, which were historically occupied by more affluent locals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowhouses are so important to Philadelphia&#8217;s identity that the city actually created a </span><a href="https://urbanrowhouse.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/the-philadelphia-rowhouse-manual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manual for those who own them! </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual outlines why they are significant and how to renovate them. For example, it encourages rowhouse owners to consider the impact of facade renovations on the look of their neighborhood. (This even applies if the building isn’t a landmark or in a historic district.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual shares a few more rowhouse-specific renovation tips. For example, it recommends using a modified asphalt—a specific type of material—for the gently sloping roofs, which most rowhouses have. The manual also covers serious construction changes, like adding a garage under the home. (Another upside: there’s plenty of general renovation advice in the manual that can relate to non-rowhouse owners!)</span></p>
