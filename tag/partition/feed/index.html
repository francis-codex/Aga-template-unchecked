<h3>Deciding to stay and renovate—or move</h3>
<p class="p2">Ilene and Neil have lived in this enviably located West Village condo since buying it in 2004. “We’ve always loved the building and the neighborhood,” Neil said of the 1906 structure’s history as the Henry Siegel department store. The 14th Street building was rehabbed into condominiums around 2001.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p2">There was a point where they considered moving on, Neil said. “We went through a period where we looked at other apartments,” he recalled, for more space to live in. Ultimately, though, they realized it would be hard to beat what they had. Instead of moving, they decided to renovate. Ilene, a retired CEO of a global nonprofit<span class="s3">,</span> and Neil, a retired attorney, wanted to go full-scope on the renovation and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brought in Aaron as their partner</a>.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48976 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Screen_Divider-07.gif" alt="Image of a sliding room divider" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Finding an architect for the West Village condo renovation</h3>
<p class="p2">“Our challenge,” Aaron said, “was to make smarter use of the space in a way sensitive to how Ilene and Neil live day-to-day. It also needed to be flexible for when their children and grandchildren visit.” The building, having been designed and constructed as a department store, features large windows and high ceilings, making it ideal for residential use.</p>
<p class="p2">Ilene and Neil completely re-envisioned the space. On their fearless To-Do list: Relocate the apartment’s front door; shrink and move the living room and partition an “L” pass-through space into a room with the help of sliding doors; create an all-new, contemporary kitchen; to shift the dining area; install a new primary bathroom, replacing the bathtub with a walk-in steam shower; and add walk-in closets throughout the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48971 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06.jpg" alt="Image of a full wall bookshelf with library ladder and storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Library-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">“We wanted a more modern look with cleaner lines and more functionality,” Neil said. “We wanted the apartment to feel more ‘feng shui.’”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Dividing the floor plan to create more rooms</h3>
<p class="p2">After conducting vision and planning meetings with his clients, and obtaining a plan approval from New York City’s Department of Buildings, Aaron and the couple hired their Sweeten contractor. As first-time gut-renovators, Ilene and Neil’s biggest questions involved how long the project would take. They sublet a small apartment in the building so they could drop in and check on progress daily<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48968 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Image of kitchen countertops, wall of art and dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48969 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen peninsula and kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">They began by refinishing the original wood flooring, which runs throughout the apartment. A new room would take shape with the installation of sliding door panels to close off the base of the<span style="color: #333333;"> former “L” space, just outside the bedroom. The installation of the German-design kitchen was also a key development. “It let us envision the ultimate look and feel of the revised space for the first time,” said Neil.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #333333;">Neil was happy about the moving of the couple’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer to a small space</a> near the primary bathroom, making room for a kitchen pantry. The renovation brought added functional spaces. For Neil, the emergence of a living room that would accommodate a 65” smart TV was a</span> revelation. “Our architect and contractor both consistently came up with design and storage solutions that enhanced the project,” he said. “We were excited about everything.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48966 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11.jpg" alt="Image of a living room area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Den-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<blockquote><p>“Our architect and contractor both consistently came up with design and storage solutions that enhanced the project,” he said. “We were excited about everything.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Navigating the renovation bumps</h3>
<p class="p2">One challenge was when the building’s architect refused to approve Aaron’s plan for the steam shower. “The building’s architect claimed—in the face of data to the contrary—that steam showers create mold,” Neil said. “Actually, being completely enclosed, they generate less discharge than regular showers.” After more discussions with the condo board and management company, the couple discovered that seven other units in the building already had steam showers. Ilene and Neil settled the issue by signing an indemnification promising payment for building problems the shower might cause.</p>

<h3>The architect turns a house into a home</h3>
<p class="p2">The duo said that one of the best moves they made was to choose an architect and general contractor who welcomed their participation, and engaged them when problems arose. <span style="color: #333333;">Aaron felt excited to work with clients who were focused not just on “the idea of a new home, but also committed to the process. They wanted to be intimately involved in and understand each design decision.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48959 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18.jpg" alt="Image of bathroom with stone floor, steam shower and teak bench" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48962 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21.jpg" alt="Image of a white double sink vanity" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bathroom-21-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #333333;">In addition to the condo’s owners, Aaron had other occupants to consider. “Ilene and Neil have amassed an <a href="https://stylebyemilyhenderson.com/blog/ideas-for-how-to-arrange-and-hang-wall-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing collection of objects</a>,” he said, “each with a specific story to tell about their lives.” Every one of their belongings, he remarked, has significant meaning. “Our goal,” he said, “was to let the architecture get out of the way and stay muted and neutral.” <span class="s3">That would let Ilene and Neil’s prized possessions make the space.</span></span></p>
<h3>A general contractor who communicates</h3>
<p class="p2">The contractor’s crew, they said, worked steadily, coordinated well with the building’s superintendent, and stayed on top of every aspect of the project as it unfolded. &#8220;<span class="s1">I’ve said it before and will say it again &#8211; our contractor will be my first call when looking for bids on the next project,&#8221; said Aaron.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The team also made cost-saving suggestions. “The Sweeten contracting team was truly professional—they were problem solvers and genuinely nice people to work with,” Aaron said. “Communication was frequent and clear, and the scheduling and billing were transparent.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48963 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16.jpg" alt="Image of a master bedroom with art collection and ceiling fan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Bedroom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48965 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17.jpg" alt="Image of master closet with organization and shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aaron-Closet-17-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Their Sweeten contractor finished the project with a very manageable punch list. Ilene said, &#8220;My gratitude to our contactor and to Aaron is boundless.&#8221; The results pleased everyone. “The difference in our living space is like night and day!” Neil said. “It feels like a totally different apartment.” Months after moving back into their home, he declares, “We still love waking up here every morning.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A glass shower door brings light and transparency to any space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While shower curtains can add flair to your bathroom, they aren’t always ideal for smaller spaces or a more streamlined look. Enter the glass shower door: it immediately makes a room feel more spacious, modern, and clean. They’re also easy on upkeep—a quick swipe with a squeegee and you’re good to go. These glass panels come in a variety of styles, can be framed with metal or rimless for a “floating” look, and can be fixed, sliding, or made to swivel on a hinge. Take a look below for some favorite bathroom renovations done by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deeksha and Joe&#8217;s</a> windowed wall and guest bedroom.</p>
<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A sunny guest bedroom &amp; spare office space emerge with help from interior windows</h2>
<p>The alcove has long played a supporting role in many post-war city apartments &#8212; a flexible, windowed nook off the living room that can pass for an office or a nursery, or turn a studio into an almost-but-not-quite one-bedroom. Lots of possibilities, but typically one big compromise: leave the alcove open and lose the privacy of extra sleeping space, or close it off and lose extra light and views. For a family moving from Washington, DC, to Washington Heights, a Sweeten renovation transformed a living room and alcove with some of the loveliest space-saving solutions we’ve seen yet. Read on down to see how this family of three made the move work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19997 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> <em>Guest post by Deeksha Gaur, Manhattan homeowner and co-founder of <a href="https://www.show-score.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Show-Score.com</a></em></span></p>
<h3>A young family finds their first home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In November of 2014, Joe and I moved back to New York City from Washington, DC. When we last lived in Manhattan, we were a young couple who had just moved in together, renting a place in Chelsea and living the New York dream. Three years later we were back, married, and with a three-month-old in tow. We hoped to buy our first home as a new family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before our move, we came up to NYC to explore our options and see just how unrealistic our wish list was! After a long and disappointing day of showings, we drove up to a co-op building in Washington Heights. The building was warm, unpretentious and full of families. The apartment itself was spacious, well-cared for, and had the most gorgeous views of the George Washington Bridge. The manager told us that the building was home to musicians, actors, and all sorts of artists and creative types. Now, I was pinching myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the aesthetics of the apartment weren’t to our tastes, it was easy to imagine a set-up where the living area could be light and airy, a perfect palette for the art that makes our house a home wherever we happen to be living. We could imagine the perfect first bedroom for our son and we envisioned ways to make the dark kitchen a little brighter. In other words, it was clear that with a little work, this was the perfect first home for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19926 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01.jpg" alt="deeksha_living_room-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Deeksha_Living_Room-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a double-duty space for guests and work</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, while we were lucky to have found a great two-bedroom apartment, we regularly have friends and family come from across the globe to spend extended periods of time with us. We knew we could create a spare room from the foot of our L-shaped living room, but that part of the house has great light and views, and we didn’t want to lose it behind opaque drywall. So, we needed a unique solution for a partition that could afford both privacy and openness. Our dream solution was a sort of hybrid window wall that was partly opaque partition and partly interior windows—but, we had no idea if this was remotely feasible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Second, we have a lot of books and not a lot of storage. Plus, we needed a primo spot for the television. I have always been a big fan of the floor-to-ceiling built-in bookcases you see in old NYC apartments, and adding that kind of a feature seemed like the perfect solution—both practically and aesthetically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to dealing with these large carpentry projects, we had undertaken a few small updates and renovations—a widening of a doorway here, some paint there, fun wallpaper for our son’s first room, etc. We had been really unhappy with our contractor and so we were extra-nervous about jumping into an even bigger home improvement. This negative experience had left us paralyzed. We wanted to make the changes but didn’t know where to go next. Then, a friend told us about Sweeten. She’d had her kitchen redone and was beyond thrilled. (You can see her Sweeten renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/clinton-hill-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) So, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and crossed our fingers.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t have enough words to communicate just how seamless this process was. We were connected with three people, all amazing! They were consummate professionals and visionary designers. We knew we would be in good hands with any of them. But in the end, we were thrilled to work with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. It was clear from the very beginning that he was a perfectionist and would help shape and execute our vision beautifully and with great care. And both he and his wife, Rachel, were very helpful and responsive to all of our questions and concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got to visit him at his workshop in Peekskill, NY, and see the impressive array of projects he was working on. But best of all, he grasped our needs right away. He was able to take our nascent design ideas and turn them into computer renderings that allowed us to see our vision come to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a few alterations, we signed off on the design and our contractor got to building. A couple of weeks before the install, he worked with us to pick our own cabinet and drawer pulls for the bookcase, as well as the doorknob for our new third bedroom, all of which we got from Anthropologie. The install itself took a little under three days, and our contractor&#8217;s perfectionism came to the fore, as he perfectly placed each doorknob, and touched up every nick and scratch. He was so great, in fact, that we recommended him to our neighbors, for whom he also created a part-glass wall partition and built-ins.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor&#8217;s amazing work transformed our house into a home. When I walk into the house and sit on our couch and read or watch TV, there’s nowhere else I’d rather be. With the partition of interior windows, we&#8217;ve kept the gorgeous views that made us fall in love with the place to begin with. Now we just need to install some window blinds to give our guests some privacy when they stay!</p>
