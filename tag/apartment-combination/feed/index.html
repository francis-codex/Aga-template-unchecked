										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Outdated units merge into a family home in Manhattan</h2>
<p><i>Megan and Zack thought a one-bedroom apartment would be sufficient space for them—and maybe a child down the line—when they purchased their home in a 1928 co-op building in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan. A year of living in the space, however, changed their perspective. The good news? Luck was on their side, as a one-bedroom next door became available. They set out to combine the two apartments and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885"><i>posted their project on Sweeten</i></a><em>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. </em><i>With their contractor by their side, they reimagined a home fit for them and (spoiler alert!) their little one.</i></p>

<i>Guest post by homeowner Megan</i></p>
<p>When Zack and I came across a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op building in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, I convinced him we could “Marie Kondo” our lives and one day raise a child in the minimalist 600 square feet. As we went through the process of buying the apartment, sharing our entire financial histories, tax returns, and hopes and dreams for the future with each other (and the bank and co-op board), we began to affectionately call each other tenants-in-common.</p>
<p>The first time we entered our new apartment after closing, Zack proposed in the living room. Months later at City Hall, we discovered that it’s easier to get a marriage license than a mortgage.</p>
<p>A year into living in our new place, it became clear the apartment was in dire need of a renovation, and space would be tight if we ever had a child—even if we committed to the life-changing magic of tidying up. When we discovered the one-bedroom apartment next to ours was available, our “it’s so crazy, it just might work” plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combine the two units</a> went into action, and we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project on Sweeten</a>. Before finding Sweeten, the sketchiness factor of finding a contractor was a bit high for our comfort. In contrast, Sweeten’s process felt legitimate and professional. We were impressed with the three contractors we matched with and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this general contractor</a>.</p>

<p>Our original apartment had only one street-facing window, a single light in each room, and was very dark. Plus, it had bold wallpaper and flashy light fixtures that just weren’t our taste. The second one we bought hadn’t been touched in decades. Combining both of them would allow us to rethink the space to suit our needs and lifestyle. The new layout and recessed lighting allowed us to brighten up the space.</p>
<p>We made one kitchen bigger and eliminated the other to create a living room, and the former living room became our master bedroom. Our old bedroom became a nursery, although we called it a “guest bedroom” for the first few months so future grandparents wouldn’t get their hopes and expectations up. I found out I was pregnant about four months into the renovation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted a clean, modern, and bright space. I grew up in a house with white walls and dreamed of the day I would have my own place with HGTV-inspired fun accent walls and bold colors. Yet somehow we ended up with white walls, which probably means I’m turning into my parents. The best money we spent was on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof windows and soundproof walls.</a> We used to be able to hear everything happening outside on the street, and the lack of noise transformed the space. Now, when we’re eavesdropping on people’s conversations outside, it’s on purpose.</p>

<p>The kitchen is beyond our wildest dreams of anything we ever expected to have in New York City. We wanted it to be completely uncluttered, so we built spaces in the cabinets for the microwave, dishwasher, and trash. The gigantic kitchen sink brings me joy on a daily basis. Originally, we were thinking a medium-sized sink, but our contractor pushed us to consider something bigger, and we’re glad we did. The sink has all sorts of inserts—a cutting board, colander, tub, drying racks, and Murphy bed (just kidding about the last one) so it becomes any type of prep-surface we need.</p>

<p>We took advantage of an awkward corner to install a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in breakfast nook</a>. It’s become our go-to place for eating meals and working. Plus, it’s a natural gathering place and a cozy use of an oddly-shaped space. For the pantry, we used an Elfa system to create a miniature sewing room with a designated desk and outlet in there for my sewing machine.</p>

<p>The ice and water dispenser on the door of our refrigerator also has an outsized impact on our daily lives. After wasting years of our precious youth waiting for water to drip through a Brita filter, it feels like a miracle to have ice and cold water tumble effortlessly into a glass.</p>

<p>Both bathrooms stayed in place, though the one in the original apartment became our master bathroom adjacent to our new bedroom. My parents are updating their own house to be “aging-in-place” so we decided to put a walk-in shower instead of a tub in the guest bath, and used door levers instead of knobs throughout the apartment. We also installed hand showers in both spaces.</p>
<p>An image on Pinterest inspired the walls of hexagon tiles in our guest bathroom.  I loved how the classic shape was being used in an unexpected way. As someone who hates to scrub grout, using dark tile and gray grout in the shower seemed like a win-win for laziness and classiness.</p>

<p>In our new master bedroom (formerly our original living room), we wanted to maximize the minimal natural light. I read that light colors can make a dim room seem smaller, so we decided to paint the walls and ceilings a rich navy. That, combined with the blackout shades, makes for a very cozy sleeping environment. Along with the kitchen lights, the master bedroom lighting is voice-controlled. Having smart lights started out as a novelty, but became so useful once we had a baby to carry around. We may not have a flying car, but lying in bed and telling a robot to turn off the bedroom lights is our version of living in the future.</p>

<p>Our former bedroom is now the guest room and nursery. The neutral color palette, mixed with fun prints on the walls, makes it the perfect space for both. An architect friend suggested barn doors for the office to let more natural light into the whole apartment too.</p>
<p>We’ve watched enough home improvement shows to know that the unexpected is to be expected. Sure enough, we discovered pipes in a wall that needed to be re-routed and had to change our plans for the guest bathroom toilet when we found a floor beam in the way of our plumbing. With each surprise, our contractor kept us updated and came up with workable solutions. He was very upfront about what our options were and what the changes to our original scope of work would cost.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor has a really good eye for design, and anytime we were in doubt about a decision, we followed his advice. From the soundproof windows and tile selections to the kitchen counters and a square toilet (surprisingly comfortable!), he never steered us wrong. We also appreciated how our contractor kept us updated; he set up a WhatsApp group chat which allowed us to easily communicate throughout the whole project, and we had weekly meetings face-to-face.</p>
<p>Having started this project as a couple and finishing it with a baby in tow, we can say that it’s faster (and cheaper) to create a human life than to renovate an apartment. That said, keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There is a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family.</p>
<p><em>We hope you love your new home, Megan and Zack!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the deal fell through on a new, larger apartment, Zoe and Arvid decided to stay put in their Lincoln Square building in Manhattan and make their 700-square-foot one-bedroom work. But two years later, the cramped space won out, and they went on the hunt for a new home. Zoe, who admits to an unhealthy relationship with HGTV, dreamt of buying, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining</a>, and renovating an adjoining apartment. They decided to send letters to their adjacent neighbors and, to their surprise, one was looking to move, so they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What Zoe, who works in finance, and Arvid, a 3-D designer, wanted most was extra space where they could spread out and finally be able to sit down at a proper dining table instead of crouching over the coffee table. For style, the couple would need to compromise. Zoe liked mid-century modern and rustic looks while Arvid preferred clean, modern lines with a dash of industrial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor they chose</a> to combine their apartments set out to remove the two existing kitchens, rip out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and demo some internal walls to create a third bedroom. They moved into a sublet during much of the work.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few “must-haves” as the couple thought through the design. Since they’re a “<span style="color: #333333;">shoes-off household,</span>” said Zoe, they needed a storage solution near the entrance. The answer, literally, was hidden in a structural column close to where they broke through the two apartments. At first, the duo tossed around ideas about how to make the column “purposeful.” Their ideas ranged from a gas fireplace to a wine fridge. Instead, they chose &#8220;practical,&#8221; she said, and created a hidden shoe closet. “Our contractor really worked with us on hardware—concealed hinges and push-open latch—and hand-sawed the baseboard to get a wider angle for the slide-out racks,” she explained. The shoe slide-out from Elfa fit the space, and to give it a sense of design, it was painted a deep accent color for some contrast and to hide dirt on the push-open door.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. &#8216;We decided to make lemonade out of this.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When they opened the wall that would be the spot for the<span style="color: #333333;"> dining room</span>, the mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. “We decided to make lemonade out of this,” said Zoe and thought about how to turn it into a design element. They settled on a “partition” type of structure that took the least amount of space while letting the light through. They found Blacktable Studio to walk them through the process. As a 3-D designer, Arvid took the lead on this fun project, creating the designs and submitting his sketches. The panels were delivered two weeks later. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They also liked the idea of having an extendable table for extra guests. “We never had a proper dining area before, so the prospect of having one definitely prompted a lot of imaginary dinner parties,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the couple’s time was spent looking for <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a></span> because it was the most prominent backdrop in the apartment and would set the tone for everything else. They wanted wide 7” to 8&#8243; European-style planks that were not too light or too dark. Arvid spent a lot of time finding the right hue, saturation, and wood grain. “It turned into a bit of an obsessive pursuit and we finally agreed on a natural color that&#8217;s very rustic with knots and saw marks. It&#8217;s a bit of a risk, but most people seem to love it,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33719 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, there was an AC/radiator below the window. More than 50 years of painting had “made it a big sad mess,” Zoe said. They wanted to cover it and also make it functional. Their Sweeten contractor listened to their input, and, she said, “we just designed it on the fly. One weekend Arvid used leftover black sample paint to paint over the heating elements behind the built-in.” This created more contrast against the outside white paint. Now the built-in&#8217;s horizontal slats look crisper, and you can barely see the mechanical elements behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other detail they focused on was smart light switches. The commonly available ones didn’t look good and the modern looking ones were way out of their budget. They took a chance on Noon Home, a start-up company selling ones around $100. “We couldn’t be happier,” she said. “The product looks modern and the app works great.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33701 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bedroom, accent wall, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33702 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-white-glass-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" alt="blue wall and a white glass door and light brown floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compromise their style preferences, they invented a design hybrid they called “Scandinavian mid-century” with a lot of black and white and plenty of geometric shapes. They learned the importance of taking time to plan a renovation. “Do a lot of showrooming and Pinteresting; both help you to know what you like,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33714 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33700 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, chevron tile, glass shower door" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once the work starts, there is little time to decide,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” Zoe measured the maximum size of her pots and condiments and knew the drawer heights she needed. The only shortfall of planning too well is that you might become too attached to certain choices. She suggests being prepared for changes and understand that sometimes, you’ll have to go with the second choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33705 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, glass shower door, chevron tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of some permit delays, the apartment was not ready for move-in after their sublet ended. For three weeks, they began an Airbnb-hopping adventure. “It&#8217;s a lot of stress, but we discovered different neighborhoods and lifestyles. We now know for sure commuting to New Jersey is not meant for us,” Zoe said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on-site</a> for the second half of the project was a big challenge and meant being around a lot of dust and living out of suitcases. Now that it’s completed, she said their new home makes them feel “happy!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Two units become an oasis—and include a fireplace</h2>
<p><em>When the search for a 3-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side left this homeowner disappointed, he decided to improvise. He purchased two units in a newly converted co-op building and planned to combine them, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting his project on Sweeten</a> to find the right <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor</a> for the job. Six months later, he had the home he’d been looking for, complete with a light-filled great room, premium appliances, and a state-of-the-art fireplace.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-01" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30712" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/floorplan_before-723x1085.jpg" alt="floorplan_before" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
The building this homeowner decided to move into had been newly converted from middle-income housing to condos. While looking for a 3-bedroom apartment, he discovered that the available units that met his criteria were too small. When he approached the building’s management to see if there were any 2-bedroom apartments that could be combined into one, he learned that none of the units were eligible because of their shared walls. Instead of giving up, he asked them to double check with their architect. The architect came back with good news; units in the F and G lines could be combined. The homeowner bought units 22F and 22G, which are both located at the end of a hallway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartments had been renovated in a style that he felt was acceptable, but not as sleek of an aesthetic that he had in mind. He set his sights on creating an efficient and modern home that was highly functional without sacrificing any comfort. The apartments were to be combined at the end of the hallway and through the walls that aligned with each unit’s kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30716 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-08" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30715" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After realizing that designating one of the two entrances as the main entrance would create an awkward flow, he purchased 50 square feet of the hallway between the apartments to build a new entryway. “It was expensive,” he said, “but worth it.” Moving the entrance to the master exposed old wiring belonging to an outdated intercom system which was apparently still in use in a few of the much older apartments in the building. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Sweeten contractor had to hire</a> an expert in this kind of wiring to reroute it, which he deemed a nuisance but not a huge deal.</p>
<p>For the main living space, he envisioned an open-plan kitchen, family room, living room, and dining room that would give the space a loft-like feeling. The major elements of the renovation included opening the walls to combine the apartments and demolishing the two existing kitchens to build a completely new one. He also expanded the size and layout of the master bedroom and bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30717 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30719" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner, who likes to cook, found out that moving the gas line in the kitchen to accommodate a Wolf gas stovetop would be too big of a challenge, so he opted for a Wolf convection <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stovetop</a>, which he’s grown to love. “It&#8217;s modern, sleek, and boils a pot of water in seconds,” he said. He also wanted to convert part of one of the old kitchens into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laundry room</a> and install stackable washer and dryer units, noting that the overall process was seamless and easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30724 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-16" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30718 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-15-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-15" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30729" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-11-12" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, he wanted to create a mini spa with a walk-in shower, slate floor tile, and marble walls. One of the challenges he faced was converting the bathtub into a walk-in shower because it required raising the floor underneath for the drain pipes to meet the code requirements. He expanded the bathroom by utilizing a nearby closet, which became difficult because he was placing a wet space over a dry space, and had to move the wiring to the main electrical box to make it work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30721 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30723 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-06" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30720" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-03" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, he wanted to incorporate interesting design and architectural lighting. The fact that the building is postwar—built in 1971—meant that he couldn’t drill into the slab. To solve this problem, he decided to drop the ceilings in most of the apartment by 4” to 6” inches to allow for recessed lighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To warm up the family and living room part of the great room, he decided to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> that wouldn’t require board approval to install. His search led him to a company called Hearth Cabinets, which has a patented technology that uses sterno-like gel to create a very realistic-looking fire. The fireplace meets all required codes and didn’t require any sort of approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30727" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-13" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While renovating, he said he learned it’s important to dot your &#8220;i’s&#8221; and cross your &#8220;t&#8217;s.&#8221; “Don&#8217;t be casual about what fixtures you choose or what you allow the contractor to do without input, especially if, like me, you want to do a very custom, high-end project,” he said. Also, be nice to your neighbors. “One of mine complained about the noise and construction was shut down for two weeks.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30731" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Andrew_Apartment-17" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With construction starting in November of 2016 and finishing in April of 2017, the obstacles he encountered extended the job about two months. While he said he wouldn’t choose to live through another renovation, he’s thrilled with the end result of this one. Because the space is on the 22nd floor, it gets great natural light. The terraces, located on each end of the great room, provide a feeling of indoor and outdoor living. “Being in the room,” the homeowner said, “feels like living in a peaceful oasis above the city.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In New York City it&#8217;s tough to find an apartment with enough space, and near impossible to find one with extra. So, when the apartment next door went up for sale in the O&#8217;Neill Building, these Ladies&#8217; Mile homeowners had a great opportunity to combine the apartments, and double the size of their Manhattan pied-à-terre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re excited to introduce one of theSweeten&#8217;s newest members, Virtus Design, owned by interior designer Frederick Wildfoerster. Virtus specializes in apartment combinations and townhouse renovations, and they have a special interest in classical and traditional interiors, which made them a natural fit for these homeowners&#8217; combination in the historic O&#8217;Neill Building (c. 1887).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9757 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Virtus Design team collaborated with architect and tS member Peter Lombardi on this combination; their objective was to design the combined apartments to look, feel and function as one unit. The biggest issue in combining apartments is often the structural limits of the building&#8217;s original design, and for this reason, many of these renovations end up with an awkward layout. Since the O&#8217;Neill Building was originally a department store with an open floor plan, it made reconfiguring the units much easier.<span id="more-9755"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9758 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the combination, the homeowners&#8217; original apartment was in very good condition, however, the neighboring unit needed a lot of work; it had an outdated &#8220;single guy&#8221; design, with river rock stone in the bathrooms and a rather dark, brooding color palette. The entire project took about 9 months to complete and, in addition to joining the units, involved renovating the two bathrooms in the new space, replacing some of the flooring, building new closets, and creating a gym, an office, additional storage and display areas for the owner&#8217;s artwork and antiques.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9761 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="792" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-227x300.jpg 227w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completely redesigned entrance space features a curved wall, echoing the oval &#8216;turret&#8217; area of the main living space, and is now the center axis that extends to all the rooms. The designers&#8217; use of Belgian limestone in both the entry and kitchen brings the disparate flooring together to create visual unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9759 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="739" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above, recessed wall niches display and protect two antique, hand-carved sculptures. The well-traveled homeowners were Virtus&#8217; design inspiration for the new apartment; the combination was designed to showcase their art and antiquities collection. Each room serves as a reminder of their travels and tells a story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9760 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="648" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-278x300.jpg 278w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two feature walls were built into the renovated bathrooms; LED light strips are concealed within a 4&#8243; cove to frame the wall with a soft glow. Throughout the apartment, sculpted white walls and accent lighting make it easy to showcase both smaller framed artwork and large pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9762 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg" alt="Interior design photography" width="600" height="756" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_Virtus-Design_Ladies-Mile-Residence-238x300.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space itself is a work of art; we can&#8217;t wait to see more from the Virtus Design team!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A big thanks to Virtus Design for sharing their amazing project with us, and special thanks to Alex Kotlik Photography for the beautiful photos.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Working with Olga was fun and easy. She has endless amounts of patience and good ideas, and is a very creative problem solver.  I am very grateful to Sweeten for making the connection.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Erica S., Brooklyn Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brooklyn homeowners Erica, documentary filmmaker, &amp; Spencer, photojournalist, have a few unique things in common — they both travel &amp; document the world for their work, and they both come from families of antique collectors. It seems no wonder that they also share a mutual interest in maps. A little over six years ago, during a long search for their first home, the couple walked into a one-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace to find a giant map covering an entire wall. They took the map as a sign and made the purchase. A few years later, with the arrival of their daughter, Vivienne, the family started considering options for a larger space, and were eyeing the adjacent one-bedroom for an addition. It turned out the neighbors had a similar idea in mind for themselves, but weren’t positioned to do so yet, so they agreed to sell. For help designing their new home, Erica &amp; Spencer posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/657" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their project</a> to theSweeten. Architect &amp; tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olga Bakic</a> proved to be the family&#8217;s perfect match — read on to learn about their beautifully renovated home!<span id="more-8943"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9015 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="801" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/floor-plans-LAYOUT-copy-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s original apartment was 900 sqft, and their neighbors&#8217; space (in grey above) was 750. The homeowners&#8217; main objectives in combining the units were to take down the dividing wall (&#8211;the time had come to part with the map), open up their existing galley kitchen, combine their bedroom &amp; bathroom for a master suite, create a wall of built-in bookshelves, and tear out the second kitchen, which they turned into an office with a built-in desktop.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Olga is extremely patient and dedicated, not to mention a wonderful person.  She listened to and accommodated my opinions, but was also honest enough to (in retrospect) save me from some mistakes.  She has a great design sense.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8972 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walking in the front door of the renovated space: here, we have a split view of each of the two original apartments &#8212; the closet on the right is located where the neighbors&#8217; entry hall used to be, and everything to the left of it was originally a part of Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s home. The map-covered wall that separated the 2 apartments used to be right down the center, along the axis of the dining table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8973 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/03_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spencer &amp; Erica&#8217;s shared love of travel &amp; antiques is expressed in their eclectic collection of artwork, maps, artifacts &amp; furnishings.  The dining table &amp; chairs are all antique; above the dining set is a mirrored chandelier by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjrhU8yTOmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Ogden</a>, an artisan who collects vintage parts from flea markets, factories &amp; junk yards, and combines them by hand to create beautiful, original pieces. When designing with Olga, the homeowners expressed their interest in adhering to the home&#8217;s existing &#8212; at times quirky &#8212; pre-war style, rather than doing anything too sleek or modern. One of the most prevalent design outcomes of this is the archway openings that were used throughout the new construction to match the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8975 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/05_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A map in the living room caught our eye and makes a wonderful accent to Erica &amp; Spencer&#8217;s leather Chesterfield sofa, which they picked up at a tag sale in Connecticut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8976 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/06_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the sofa, the family can take advantage of their new open kitchen, and admire its charm! Like the dining room chandelier, the pendant lamps are crafted by Robert Ogden, as well as the stools which he produces for his separate line, <a href="https://lostine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lostine</a>. The wooden bartop is custom made of reclaimed pine from <a href="https://ogtstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olde Good Things</a>. Cabinets from the original kitchen were re-used in the new design, and a new backsplash was added in <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Lantern-12-1-2-in-x-12-1-2-in-White-Porcelain-Mesh-Mounted-Mosaic-Tile-FKOLB10/202101830#.UcM2PPa17fY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merola Lantern tiles</a>, available at Home Depot.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the master bedroom which features a curated array of vintage furnishings &amp; accessories for a nostalgic, dreamlike space. The antique bed has been Erica&#8217;s since she was a child, but her favorite piece is the star chandelier which belonged to her grandparents. Spencer collects old trunks, so they have a nice, big trunk for the foot of the bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8978 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg" alt="combining-apartments-brooklyn" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/08_theSweeten_OlgaBakic_EricaCombo-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowners had long wanted a whole wall of bookshelves, so Olga helped them design a built-in unit for their new family room / library. This space could also double as a guest or third bedroom &#8212; a great luxury in the city! Overhead, an antique-inspired pendant from <a href="https://www.rhbabyandchild.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=rhbc_prod389109" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a> hangs from the ceiling.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We do not miss the wall &#8211; or the map &#8211; we are thrilled with the space, the layout, the new lifestyle.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome job to Olga for helping to make a new home that is just right for this young, adventurous family &#8212; thanks so much to Erica, Spencer &amp; Vivienne for sharing their unique space!</p>
<p>6/20/2013 UPDATE:</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment, Virginia! It looks like they have a pretty handy vertical bike rack. Will look into the source!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;TheSweeten is brilliant. There really is no other way to properly access the best providers to address a renovation&#8230; I valued [GSDO&#8217;s] honesty and integrity the most. You have to trust the people that you are working with.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Paul K., East Harlem Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apartment combinations are a common project we see at theSweeten, and we have several of them to share in the next few months &#8212; starting with this week’s site visit up in East Harlem. A couple years ago, homeowners Paul (photographed above) &amp; Teresa relocated from Union Square to a newly renovated building in the more family-oriented, uptown neighborhood where their young son could enjoy the park and have a little extra space to play. Then, last year, the family was also able to purchase the apartment adjacent to their own, so <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Condo-combination-New-York-NY-awarded-to-contractor/420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted to Sweeten</a> to find an architect to draw up the plans for a legal combination of the 2 units which were connected by the elevator corridor. From their matches, Paul &amp; Teresa chose to work with Adam Glickman &amp; Lauren Schlesinger of tS firm <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSDO</a> to design their spacious, 2,800 sqft version of a “classic 8.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="family-room-with-ceiling-beams" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48047 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem.jpg" alt="family room with large windows and white walls and hardwood floors and exposed ceiling beams after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From 2009-2011, the historic building underwent a complete renovation by a local developer who not only brought it up to date, but also up to LEED Gold rating. Paul &amp; Teresa loved the modern edge that the developer brought to the 1920&#8217;s building through the updated construction details, and wanted to follow suit with the combination project.<span id="more-8674"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="hallway-with-hardwood-floors" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48056 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-1-1.jpg" alt="white entry hallway with hardwood floors and recessed lights after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-1-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Straight ahead is the former apartment entrance &#8212; now a threshold into the expanded entry foyer that connects the home’s 2 wings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="foyer-with-wallpaper-carpet-flooring" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48057 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-8.jpg" alt="foyer with carpet flooring and striped wallpaper and tray ceiling and chandelier after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original front door was actually re-used for the new entry, and was specially installed by the contractors onto the existing elevator door frame. Before the renovation, the corridor ceiling was illuminated with a lighting cove, but the architects re-designed the lighting feature to give it a more residential character; we love the new <a href="https://pelledesigns.com/collection/bubble-chandelier-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubble chandelier by Pelle Designs</a> that was hung in place of the lighting cove. Lauren &amp; Adam helped Paul &amp; Teresa select new materials, which lead to a unique application of upholstery on the walls, after the homeowners fell in love with Maharam&#8217;s &#8220;Ruban by Kvadrat&#8221; textile.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="stainless-steel-door-lock" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48053 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-5.jpg" alt="stainless steel door locks with white and black door knobs on either side of the door after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to secure the upholstery in place, the contractors wrapped the material onto large panels of plywood, then mounted each panel to the wall and built the trim out around the new surface. The result appears impressively seamless along the corridor walls, but we get a peak at the layered construction in the profile of this opened fire exit door.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" title="carpet-hardwood-flooring" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48054 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-6.jpg" alt="patterened carpet and hardwood flooring with a seperator after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Silk-screened floor tiles are a nice, subtle compliment to the upholstered walls. Tiles are <a href="https://www.bardelli.it/detail.asp/lingua_1/idp_0/idlinea_36/linea_bardelli/marcel-wanders-iris-1-rivestimenti-piastrelle-ceramica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iris 1 from Ceramica Bardelli</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="open-living-room-with-partition-wall" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48050 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-2.jpg" alt="free standing partition wall living room with hardwood floors next to kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second living room becomes a less formal media room with fun furnishings and pops of color, like this red sofa from <a href="https://www.gusdesigngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gus</a> and the no-shed shag rug from <a href="https://delaespada.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De la Espada</a>. The pair of ottomans are from <a href="https://www.cb2.com/ottomans-benches/furniture/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CB2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-countertop-with-farmhouse-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48055 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-7.jpg" alt="white quartz kitchen countertop with undermount farmhouse sink with white faucets and oak cabinets after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tucked behind the media room, a former kitchen has become a multi-use space; part pantry, part satellite office, and potentially, part wet-bar – this little space looks like it would come in handy for informal entertaining!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="carpet-hardwood-flooring-combo" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48051 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-3.jpg" alt="textured carpet and hardwood flooring in two rooms after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Glickman-AptComboEastHarlem-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What a great new space! Many thanks to GSDO, and to Paul &amp; Teresa for sharing their home with us!</p>
