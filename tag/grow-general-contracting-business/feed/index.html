			<h2>203(k) loans come with strings attached. Understand how they work, and when they can<span>—and can&#8217;t—be used.</span></h2>

<p>In addition to cash, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, many homeowners pay for their renovations with Federal Housing Administration 203(k) loans.</p>
<h3>How do 203(k) loans work?</h3>
<p>These federal loans come with strings attached: they can only pay for specific categories of work, they release funds in two lump payments, and they often require the client to hire a HUD consultant. They pay a maximum of $35,000.</p>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans can be used to:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li>Improve a home’s functionality or attractiveness</li>
<li>Eliminate health and safety hazards</li>
<li>Rehab the plumbing or sewer systems</li>
<li>Install or repair the roof, gutters, and downspouts</li>
<li>Install or replace the flooring</li>
<li class="li1">Improve major aspects of the landscaping<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ensure accessibility for a disabled person<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make a home more energy-efficient<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>FHA 203(k) loans<span class="s1"> can’t be used to:</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make structural repairs or improvements<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Work on a rental property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new construction / room additions<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build new swimming pools<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build tennis courts, gazebos, or bathhouses<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Build other “luxury items”<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Payment schedule</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The FHA will pay the homeowner a partial sum when the 203(k) loan is approved, and the remainder at the conclusion of the project, typically after all required inspections. You won’t be able to negotiate for payments in-between these official ones.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to handle 203(k) loans</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, decide if you’re willing to accept them at all. You’ll get more work if you do, but you’ll have to be ok with the payment schedule, and possibly additional paperwork. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether you choose to accept 203(k) loans or not, bring up the topic early in discussions with a potential client, before submitting an estimate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the client plans to use a 203(k) loan, this will put hard constraints on the project scope, the budget, and the payment schedule. You’ll have to figure all of this out before you draft the contract. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You absolutely don’t want to have a signed contract in hand, and then hear, “By the way, we’re paying with a 203(k)!”</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication is key to a happy client, a good review, and building goodwill</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48336" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-10-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes a job a success? A happy client—and ideally, a great review and great portfolio pictures, to help you win more jobs. Sweeten outlines how to aim for that happy client and glowing review.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Think about your end game at the beginning</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">When negotiating your contract, ask for permission to shoot “after” pictures.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Be 100% clear about the punch list and schedule. Don’t leave room for misaligned expectations.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Define “completion” in the contract. Be explicit. If you promise to leave the space “broom clean,” explain clearly what this means. If the client would like you to hand over the space in more pristine condition, this is the time to negotiate.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate—and reduce—the client’s stress level</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Remember that the client probably hasn’t done this before, and doesn’t know what to expect. Tell them clearly about your process and what they’ll experience.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any delays, any days when no one will be working at the site, any problems.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Notify the client ASAP about any damage—even if you plan to fix it right away. You don’t want them visiting the site and getting upset because they discovered some spilled paint!<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that permits might remain open for several weeks after completion and that this is normal.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask for a review</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ideally ask at a late milestone, like when reviewing the punch list<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask in person, and make it clear that it means a lot to you<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Follow up </span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Check in with the client a month or so after completion<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Thank them for the review (or ask them again if they’d consider leaving one)<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Ask how they feel about the work, now that they’ve had a chance to live with it (Chances are high that they’ll be happy, and you’ll just be building good will. If the client has complaints, this is your chance to fix them.)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Check-in with Sweeten</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Debrief your account manager on the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Are you especially proud of this project? Ask if Sweeten will consider it for the blog.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">In summary</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipate what you’ll want at the end of the project, and start working toward it as early as possible. Anticipate your clients’ concerns, and start taking care of them as early as possible. These are the secrets to success! </span></p>

<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="orange-living-room-during"  class="alignnone wp-image-50681 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg" alt="orange living room in the process of renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GC-post_juggling-clients_-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Sweeten knows that as a general contractor, you handle multiple jobs simultaneously—you sometimes bend your schedule to accommodate delivery delays, permit snags, sick subcontractors, and whatever else tomorrow brings.</p>
<p class="p2">But your client probably doesn’t know any of this. Here are our tips for setting expectations—the key to happy clients and great reviews.</p>
<p><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Be upfront and transparent about how you work</h3>
<p class="p2">Explain early that you have <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-to-talk-about-your-client-renovation-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crews working on multiple jobs</a>, and that it’s normal, say, for the electrician to run off to work on a different project. And that it’s normal for there to be hours—or even days—when there are no workers on site. Explain that some work may have to wait for materials to be delivered, or for adhesives to dry.</p>
<p class="p2">Make it clear that circumstances often force schedule changes. Then let clients know ASAP any time there’s a delay or if work has to pause. An informed client is a happier client.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Be patient and open-minded during client conversations</h3>
<p class="p2">Remember that your client has probably never done this before. Questions that could seem insulting often just come from a lack of understanding about construction, or anxieties about their home being jackhammered. Please don’t take these questions personally! Answer as patiently and clearly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Emerging Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">If <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-general-contractors-does-sweeten-work-with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’re new to Sweeten</a>, you might feel tempted to bend over backward to make clients happy. We’ve seen GCs perform work outside of scope without creating a change order, etc.  Please don’t go crazy—you’re a business, and you need to treat clients as clients.</p>
<p class="p2">Stepping outside the bounds of the contractor-client relationship can lose money for you, and can create false expectations. Clients who think you’re a friend doing them a favor can feel betrayed when you start acting like a business!</p>
<h3 class="p2">Tips for Established Contracting Firms</h3>
<p class="p2">Be patient and clear when explaining why you can’t comply with a request. If it’s a technical or a code restraint, the client will be much more satisfied if they understand. Don’t let them think you’re just inflexible. You might be able to work together to find a compromise.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Remember your Sweeten Account Manager</h3>
<p class="p2">If you’re having trouble communicating something to a client, talk to us! We can always jump in and help.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with an average of $80,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pay Only-When-You-Win business model</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You only pay us when you win a job. Sweeten doesn&#8217;t charge you to sign up with us, and we don’t charge you for leads. Our fee is a small percentage of the total contract value. Most contracting firms consider it a business development expense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is this important? We only get paid when you get paid. It doesn’t serve us to waste your time by sending you dozens of low-quality leads, or by sending the same leads to dozens of random contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten cares about your success—we consider you a partner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Highest Quality Projects</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We only send you legitimate, transformative renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-renovations-does-sweeten-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects that require multiple trades</a>. We won’t waste your time with single-trade jobs or handyman tasks. Our minimum budget is $15,000. Our average contract value is $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All leads we send you are vetted for readiness and appropriate budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Vetted Leads, Matched to You</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we send you a lead, it will match your geographic service area, the types of services you offer, and your preferred budget range. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Streamlined Competitive Bidding Process</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll compete with just 2 to 4 other contracting firms for each job. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">If you and the client express interest in each other, we give you tools to help with messaging, site visit scheduling, video site visits, and hiring. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">On the client side, we help them understand and compare estimates, to help them make the best choice—even if it’s not the lowest bid.</span><span class="s1"> </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We minimize the time you spend on unpaid work. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Services to Help Contractors Grow</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten also helps contractors by giving you a dedicated account manager to help with business development and marketing. They&#8217;ll also help make your Sweeten profile and portfolio as competitive as possible. We offer opportunities for free photography and social media promotion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We stand behind your work, by offering financial protection to your Sweeten clients. They’ll be able to hire you with confidence and peace of mind. </span></p>

<p>When it comes to the many types of renovations, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> has seen it all! Whether a single-room remodel or adding square footage to a house, Sweeten helps homeowners envision their dream spaces—and then turns them into reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors are skilled in many areas of construction. <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-does-sweeten-vet-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We check their licenses</a>, insurance, quality of work, and customer service skills—all so we can ensure your remodel goes smoothly and you get connected with the right team for your project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support— for free. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some types of projects Sweeten contractors have completed. </span></span></p>

<h3>Entire Homes</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40095 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="house exterior" width="1000" height="847" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-01-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether an apartment, brownstone, or standalone house, Sweeten contractors can take any space and make it uniquely your own. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/tudor-style-house-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandra and Nelson</a> wanted to update their Brooklyn home to fit their new needs. Their kids were grown, so they wanted to focus on the house. They wanted a more convenient living space. With the help of their contractor, they remodeled the kitchen, dining, and living room. Plus, they turned a small office into a beautiful sunroom.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten also transforms apartments for open-concept living or more personal space with walls or partitions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/home-remodeling-tips-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitzie and Jenifer</a> (<em>below</em>). created a seamless flow from one living space to another.</span></p>

<p>Kitchens &amp; Baths</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37769" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg" alt="New Jersey, Jersey City, renovation, two family, remodel, one family, kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Carol-Sainthilaire-Home-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchens and baths are the sweet spots for our contractors. No matter the square footage, each space comes with its own unique set of requirements. Bathrooms and kitchens can be rip-and-replace projects, where the floor plan is not altered or they can be of a larger scope. These types of projects can entail reworking/upgrading electrical and plumbing like was necessary for two smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baths combined as one</a> (<em>below</em>) or Carol and Jon&#8217;s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-one-family-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten kitchen renovation</a> (<em>above</em>).  For these changes, an experienced contractor will call in the right pros to help.</span></p>

<h3>Garage Conversions / ADUs</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26067" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg" alt="garage renovation after" width="990" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1.jpg 990w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-600x404.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-01-1-723x487.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /></p>
<p>Commonly known as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADUs</a> (accessory dwelling units), these converted spaces have become more and more popular. They are a great way to add valuable square footage to your home and create additional, functional spaces. Sweeten contractors converted <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle&#8217;s garage</a> (<em>above</em>) and turned <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime&#8217;s garage</a> into a studio office (<em>below</em>). Each includes bathrooms and kitchenettes.</p>

<p>When you have a big project, such as updating the exterior of your home or putting on an addition, having the right renovation team is key. <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-home-addition-plan-allows-a-family-of-5-to-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia&#8217;s</a> Sweeten contractor added 1,000 square feet to the back of her house (<em>above</em>). Rosaire turned her garage into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/southampton-home-renovation-transforms-garage-into-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a> with a pantry (<em>below</em>).</p>

<p>Molding and Built-ins</p>

<p>Sometimes a room needs a small decorative touch such as trim and millwork. Built-ins are an investment that offers a finished look and functional storage as in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura and Walter&#8217;s den</a> (<em>above</em>). Trim and molding also set a polished look for every room.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to set realistic expectations on your client</span><span class="s1"> renovation timelines</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg" alt="Tom Raber Contractor Fight" width="2000" height="1334" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/TomRader-Q_A-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When owning your own contracting business, day-to-day questions or larger issues will come up where answers are uncertain or the path forward isn’t clear. A contracting community as a sounding board can be helpful in your goal to keep your business moving and growing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this second of two blog posts, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> gets advice from Tom Reber, founder of <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">The Contractor Fight</span></a>, on what stats to focus on, what he tells his coaching groups to initiate change, and how to sell for a higher profit. You can also hear more on his podcasts. <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/how-do-i-grow-my-general-contracting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read Part 1</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important stats for contractors when they’re looking to grow their business? </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First off, don’t be intimidated by the numbers—it is just scorekeeping. Think of it like fantasy football stats &#8211; you need to run the plays that get the most yardage. Using data will help you make better decisions. Like fantasy football or baseball, work on your “stats” weekly and be objective. How many times did the phone ring? Where did your leads come from? What was the size of the job? How much did you spend to get that lead? What is the close rate of all the leads from that source, how many closed?</span></p>
<p>The numbers tell you where to focus. Don’t shy away from them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>Note:</em> Tom discusses more about stats on <a href="https://thecontractorfight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">his podcast.</span></a> You can also <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/general-contractor-performance-stats-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">monitor how your business is doing</span></a> when you are part of the Sweeten network.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the top three things you encourage GCs to start doing when they join your program?</span></h3>
<h4><span class="s1">1. Engage with a like-minded community</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may sound remedial but, first and foremost, I encourage general contractors to join our online community. The first step is to get engaged—don’t be a wallflower. It is like joining a gym, and then not going—that won’t get you any closer to your goals. Get in, ask questions, engage, be present. This is a like-minded community, so share your story and listen to the stories of others. If you follow the system, it will work for you. </span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">2. Define the first problem</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get clarity around the very first issue you want to fix. You need to define that first problem. Focus on one issue and go all-in on that. Use the frameworks provided to double down and knock down that first domino. You have to dedicate time and energy to the problem, which means you won’t be able to fix everything at once.</span></p>
<h4>3. Focus on your first problem every day</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Once you have defined that first domino, build consistent habits around tackling that problem, so it always stays top of mind. Then create a checklist of three things and do it every day. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the most important things to do when looking to start selling jobs with a higher profit? </span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a hard look at your numbers</span></h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">First off, you need to give yourself a reality check (via the job-costing exercise). At least 75% of general contractors do not know or understand their own numbers. In my program, when we take them through their numbers, it is an eye-opening experience. It&#8217;s possible to sell jobs with a 50% profit. It doesn&#8217;t sound possible but it can be done.</span></p>
<h4>Sharpen your communication skills</h4>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Get your sales process in order. How you communicate with a prospective client makes a huge difference. Most contractors think it is about the scope of work or price, but it is absolutely about human connection and understanding the homeowner’s motives. Practice by role-playing with the online community. Oh, and listen when people talk; don’t just think about what you plan to say next!</span></p>
<h4>How to build trust with clients</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lastly, “mind the gap”—this is the time between the sale and the work being done. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t go silent:</strong><span class="s3"> Continue to add value during this time by educating them so they feel great about their decision to hire you. This builds trust and makes it a great experience.  </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Do what you say you will when you promise to do it:</strong><span class="s3"> Being trustworthy and having integrity is critical to this business and being able to charge higher prices. </span><span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><strong>Don’t blame customers for being cheap: </strong><span class="s3">Ask yourself first “have I done everything I can to make sure this customer feels heard?”</span><span class="s1"><i><br />
</i></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten matches general contractors</a> </span><span class="s1">with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the easiest way to start job-costing?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> A lot of general contractors overcomplicate this. It is as simple as doing the math on a regular basis. Ask yourself, “What am I spending per day to do this job?” “How many guys worked today, and what did I pay them?” “What did we spend at Home Depot?” Most people are just afraid to do the math, but if you do it daily or even weekly, it can be a lot less overwhelming.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you recommend GCs discuss profit and overhead with clients? </span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> On occasion, a customer might ask, “How much profit do you make?” I typically respond with “That is a great question! We make X, which allows us to attract top talent, pay good salaries, benefits, and allows us to honor warranties.” Don’t skirt the question or get defensive—answering honestly and openly shows that you are transparent, run a tight shop, and have integrity.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s3">What are the most common issues facing GCs in your coaching groups? What do you recommend to address these issues? </span></h3>
<h4>Problem: Limited access to new ideas</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> Hands down, the number one issue is just looking at the symptom, like not making enough money or poor employee retention, and not figuring out the root cause. This problem is caused by how you think &#8211; they [contractors] get advice from their other unsuccessful contractor buddies, which continues to limit their thinking. </span></p>
<h4>Solution: Expand your network</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> You are the average of the five people you spend time with. Make sure you surround yourself with people who can help you, rather than hold you back. </span><span class="s1">By joining our group, you get access to different ways of thinking, including the Daily Challenge, which encourages you to test and learn. You will get comfortable with the uncomfortable—and <em>that</em> is when real change can happen.</span></p>
<h4>Problem: Not tackling the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> issues</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>The second biggest issue I see is a lack of clarity and consistency. As I mentioned in a previous answer, you need to get clarity on your biggest issues and then consistently attack it. You dug this hole over time, so don’t expect it to be solved overnight! You need to have grit and stick with those good daily habits that lead to progress.</p>
<h4>Solution: Focus on the numbers</h4>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Tom:</strong> </span>One of my favorite suggestions is to install KPI Fridays. This means dedicating some time at the end of the week to focus on your numbers, whether it be job costing or goal setting and tracking. It may seem remedial, but that is where most people need to start.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45300 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit.jpg" alt="virtual site visit using laptops" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DanKen-Renovator-VirtualVisit-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is a virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit, simply, is a site visit conducted over video. It lets you safely review renovation projects while maintaining social distance with homeowners. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit helps you achieve two primary objectives:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Appraise site conditions and the project scope, so you can prepare a working estimate for the project.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">Sell your firm’s qualifications. This means building rapport with the client, sharing your proposed ideas for the renovation, and highlighting your firm’s strengths and experience..<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">The two types of virtual site visit</span></h3>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: this is most common, and makes sense if the client already lives in the space being renovated. They’ll be onsite, and will walk you though the space by video.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: this works if the client hasn’t yet moved into the space. You can go to the site and see it in person, while the client watches on video and directs you.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to prepare:</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s important to make a good first impression. Review the project information that’s been shared with you. Prepare questions for the clients about their project vision and what they’re looking for in a general contractor. This will help the conversation flow. Remember that this could be their first renovation; they won’t necessarily know all the questions that need addressing. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Video Technology</b></span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Confirm with the client that they can get a strong enough signal at the job site.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Agree on a backup plan, in case your video quality breaks down during the call. Will you move to a regular phone call? Or, if you think you can resolve the connection problems, will you reschedule a video call?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p6"><strong><span class="s1">The Sweeten Video tool:</span></strong></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">Sweeten&#8217;s in-platform video tool for virtual site visits makes it easy and organized to work with a potential client. It will run on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. No outside video apps or other downloads will be necessary. Save time on dealing with Android/iPhone compatibility issues. </span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">All parties will receive a link to the video meeting in an email.</span><span class="s4"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Your Sweeten account manager can give you a quick tutorial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"> If you use a third-party video app:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">You and the client must agree in advance on which video chat app to use.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Many clients favor Zoom or Facetime. If one or both parties use an Android device, you won’t be able to use Facetime.</span><span class="s6"><br />
</span></p>
<ul class="ul3">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Zoom is free, but limits the calls to 40 minutes, unless you have a commercial account, and you host the call.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Download any necessary software ahead of time, and try using it with a colleague, friend, or family member beforehand. Familiarize yourself with the software’s functions and quirks.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Prepare Your Questions</b></span></h5>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">These should include:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">How quickly is the client looking to start the remodel?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What qualities or services are most important to the client in a contractor?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Will an architect, designer, or the homeowner be choosing the materials? Remind the homeowner that ordering and delivery of materials to arrive on time is critical for preventing delays.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">Is the client planning to live in the space during the renovation?<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li8"><span class="s6">What constraints are there on site access, work hours, parking, etc.?<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The actual visit</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Successful virtual site visits usually have three parts: introduction, walkthrough, and discussion.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This your opportunity for a casual hello—a stand-in for a handshake. Let the client know you’re excited about the project. Share a little bit about yourself and your renovation experience. Agree on a backup plan, if there are video problems.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Virtual Renovation Site Walkthrough</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Client in the space</b>: the client will be on-site, while you watch on video remotely. Ask the client to show you the spaces that they’re planning to renovate. Have them walk through with the camera pointed away from them. As they move through the space, speak clearly; politely ask them to slow down, back up, turn left or right, point up or down. Take screenshots, or ask the clients to send photos of specific features in a followup email, if you think it will be helpful. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Contractor in the space</b>: you’ll visit the job site, while the client watches remotely. You can accomplish the same social distancing, with the added benefit that you can see the site firsthand and make actual measurements. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">With this method, some of the roles are reversed. You’ll be walking through the site, pointing your phone’s camera, while the client guides you from afar.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is your time to shine, so talk up your experience! Offer to send examples of similar projects you have completed, so the client can see evidence of your abilities. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Spend plenty of time addressing the client’s concerns. Ask them to review the project with you. Ask all the questions necessary to ascertain the project scope. Cover all the other questions you’ve prepared. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Finally, be clear about your plans to follow up. Tell the client when they can expect to see your bid. Encourage them to follow up with any questions, and tell them the best channels for reaching you.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Followup, Estimate, Ongoing Discussion</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit will usually give you enough information to draw up a “best effort” estimate. If you need more information, contact the client as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Be sure to manage expectations. Make it clear that this initial estimate should be considered “commercially reasonable,” but may need to be updated once you’ve made in-person measurements or seen inside the walls. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">And be sure to stay in touch. This will be a new experience for most clients—probably an expensive, disruptive, and scary one. The best way to put them at ease is with clear communication. Ask them their preferred channels for updates, and make sure they always know what’s going on and what to expect.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How does a virtual site visit compare with a physical site visit?</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re able to conduct a “contractor in the space” visit, to an uninhabited site, It should be just as effective. Communication is a bit more cumbersome, but you can see everything you need to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a “client in the space” visit, where you survey the site by video, you should be able to gather enough information to make an initial estimate. According to Long Island-based </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6806#overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor Robi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I truly believe a virtual site meeting for most projects will be enough to send an estimate for the labor cost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one item that is held up is the material selection process.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re a design-build firm and are assisting with design and materials</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “then even the design process can be done virtually in order to get the price of material selections.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077282363"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I get my deposit through Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>

</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077312433"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are there any fees for using Secure Pay? What about credit card fees?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You pay no transaction fees, even on credit card payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077332269"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How do I know when the client has paid?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll get a notification by email when the client approves a payment. You’ll also see payment status on your deposits dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077357578"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How is this faster than a paper check or cash?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">&#8211; Clients can respond much more quickly to your deposit request—they pay digitally, right from their Sweeten dashboard, with a few clicks. In addition to convenience, Secure Pay offers them the confidence of a trusted 3rd party payment network. They’re less likely to hesitate.<br />&#8211; Payments through Secure Pay clear faster than a check, and don’t require mailing or in-person delivery. <br />&#8211; As far as cash, homeowners are unlikely to keep enough under their mattresses! No one likes the danger and inconvenience—and the lack of financial protections—of procuring and delivering thousands of dollars in cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077370721"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay give me a competitive advantage?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">71% of homeowners on our platform have said that they’d prefer to be able to pay digitally, directly through Sweeten’s platform. 78% said they’d prefer to pay by credit card. You’ll get badges on your profile showing that you take Secure Pay for credit cards and ACH, which will distinguish you from firms that don’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077405447"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does Secure Pay build trust with clients?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Homeowners are often afraid that contractors will run off with their money. Paying through a trusted 3rd party fosters confidence and peace of mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077422125"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Can I use Secure Pay to receive all renovation payments?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Right now it’s only available for deposits, to get you hired and started as quickly as possible. But we’re working on making it available for all payments. Stay tuned!</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077439580"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Secure Pay create additional steps in my process?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">You’ll be paid directly by the client. Sweeten saves you the headache of having to open up an account with a payment processor, negotiating a rate with them, and paying a fee for each transaction. By being a part of the Sweeten network, you get access to this free service.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077456948"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Do I need to have a signed contract before requesting a deposit?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, for now—you’ll need to upload a signed contract to Sweeten before you have access to Secure Pay. In an upcoming release, we’ll allow you to request deposits earlier, so you’ll have the flexibility to use the deposit as part of the contract signing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077476640"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>How does this work with Quickbooks?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">As long as the bank account linked to Secure Pay is the same account linked to Quickbooks, you’ll see deposits come through as you would any other ACH payments.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077498635"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Why should I trust the safety and privacy of Sweeten Secure Pay?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Payments are handled by our trusted 3rd-party banking partners, Stripe and Dwolla. These are leaders in the financial industry, with rock-solid reputations for privacy and data security. Your transactions and financial information are protected by the highest level of end-to-end encryption. Sweeten cannot see or store any of your financial information.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1637077515270"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Does Sweeten’s fee get deducted automatically?</strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Absolutely not! You’ll continue to receive a separate invoice that you can pay by ACH or credit card within 30 days.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Estimating overhead and profit are important parts of any project bid. However, underestimating overhead costs on a project often cuts into the profit. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines how to manage the cost of your business within a renovation project estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h4>How does Sweeten work with general contractors?</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Contractors pay only when they win a project. </span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 1: Estimating Overhead</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Indirect overhead</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ongoing, or indirect, overhead items keep a business running long term.  There are a number of indirect or ongoing costs. These may include: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Salaries and benefits for employees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Office costs, such as rent, utilities, supplies<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Vehicle costs<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Insurance<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Marketing costs, including Sweeten fees<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Professional services including accountants, attorneys<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Software licenses<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of these expenses as the &#8220;cost of doing business&#8221; as they allow you to get in the game and operate a successful business. For that reason, many general contractors spread these costs evenly over a number of projects by incorporating them into their overhead and categorizing them as marketing. Others build it into their overhead on a project to project basis. It’s a key decision a contractor needs to make when they’re running their business. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a personal decision! The important point is to treat these fees as business expenses, and not as a reduction in profit. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct overhead costs are costs for specific projects. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Equipment rental<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Job site utilities<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Additional insurance, when required<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Manpower for non-labor charges, such as accepting deliveries and ordering materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">Project marketing expenses</span>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s3">For example, the fees for Sweeten’s services provide </span><span class="s4">business development and marketing, opportunities for free photography/blog and social media promotion, peace of mind, and consumer protections for clients that are designed to help our GCs win.</span><span class="s3"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Include anything that does not fall under materials or labor that affects the project.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 2: </span><span class="s1">Presenting P and O Estimates</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some contractors lump profit and overhead costs together. However, separating the two offers an opportunity for the contractor. Most clients don&#8217;t understand the expenses of running a business. Many people assume the profit and overhead number is mostly profit—and they will try to get the GC to reduce it. Separate the two, and it could lead to a better understanding of what is behind the estimate. It explains the cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One helpful strategy is to list some of the overhead items that benefit the client.  They will appreciate the transparency and help them understand what they’re paying for. Offering this could separate the contractor from other firms bidding on the project. The client should know if the GC will purchase more insurance or special equipment to make the project successful. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 3: </span><span class="s1">Estimating Profits</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many GC&#8217;s use a standard profit percentage for their renovation project estimates. </span><span class="s4">It is a fairly common practice for GCs to increase or decrease the percentage based on different job factors. A contractor might reduce their profit margins if it looks like the project will run very smoothly. Perhaps a client already has materials on-site, so changes or delays due to delivery issues are unlikely. Some of Sweeten&#8217;s GCs will give a small discount on profit to lock in the job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the reverse is also true! Projects that appear more difficult for some reason. For example, projects where the clients have a difficult time making decisions and you anticipate delays.  Those types might include a higher profit margin in the bid. This will give you a cushion to fall back on when problems crop up. </span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Project Estimating Tip 4: </span><span class="s1">Change Orders and Options</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Changes happen on many projects. Account for your cost by including profit and overhead items in the change order procedure. Above all, be sure to be upfront with this practice in the initial contract you sign with the client.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same is true if options, or add-ons, are included in the estimate. Include the profit and overhead in the renovation project estimate for the add-on. In those cases, the profit and overhead are combined with the estimated costs. </span></p>
<h5>Beat the competition with fair, profitable renovation project estimates</h5>
<p>We hope our guide to adding profit and overhead costs to your renovation project estimates was helpful! Knowing how to do this strategically is a crucial step in growing your contracting business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>What does Sweeten consider when vetting general contractors? Here&#8217;s everything you need to know.</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47745 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sweeten-Screens-GC-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sweeten wants general contractors who can do all of the construction work for every type of renovation project, right? Actually, wrong! While prior construction experience is great, many factors go into the process of hiring general contractors and adding them to the platform. Want to know what goes into vetting general contractors at Sweeten? Here, we outline the key factors <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> considers when vetting general contractors and approving them. (Plus, there&#8217;s a breakdown highlighting the difference between a general contractor and subcontractor!)</p>
<h3><b>What is a general contractor? </b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general contractor finds and manages experts to complete a construction project. Sometimes, the contractor themself may have background experience in construction. Or, the contractor may actually do some specialized work, like framing a room or doing tile work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kind of general contractor you&#8217;ll need depends on the type of project you’re doing! If you’re starting a ground-up project for a brand-new office building, you’ll need a contractor with experience in commercial construction or office buildings. If you were starting a luxury home bathroom project, you&#8217;d want a contractor who specializes in luxury bathrooms. (Luckily, Sweeten does this homework for you by expertly matching individual projects with the right type of contractor!)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>General contractor vs. subcontractor</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>General contractors</strong> organize experts from other trades and then bring them together to complete a project. For example, for a bathroom remodel, a general contractor would find experts in electrical, plumbing, and potentially painting work for the job.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Subcontractors</strong> are the experts specifically trained in a trade. In the bathroom remodel example, subcontractors would do the actual electrical, plumbing, or painting work. MEPs (Mechanical, electrical and plumbing) are the most frequently subcontracted trades, mainly because these trades are highly skilled and require special licenses or registrations. General Contractors may choose to subcontract out various trades depending on the scope of the project.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How does Sweeten choose general contractors? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten considers several factors when reviewing contractors: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That they have proof of insurance and licenses in Sweeten&#8217;s service areas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photos of previous work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">References from previous projects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s online presence, from professional websites to reviews or social media business accounts </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication style </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Length of time in business (a minimum of 6 months)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have insurance?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors are required to carry insurance.</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a contractor is in a state that doesn’t require them to carry insurance, (Texas, for example,) Sweeten still requires that they get a certificate of insurance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Sweeten offers up to $50,000 in financial protection, that coverage is in addition to the separate insurance policy required of all Sweeten contractors. </span></li>
<li>The three most common types of insurance carried by contractors are general liability, workman&#8217;s compensation, and auto liability insurance.</li>
<li>Workman&#8217;s compensation is useful for projects that require a crew to be on site.</li>
<li>Auto liability insurance is useful for when a general contractor is parking on your property.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Do Sweeten general contractors have licenses?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yes. All Sweeten general contractors carry licenses when available for residential renovation projects where they work. </strong></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that different states have different licensing requirements? It&#8217;s true! Fortunately, Sweeten checks licenses at both the state and/or county level. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Sweeten actively monitors the expiration dates of general contractor licenses. In fact, any general contractor with an expired license is not matched to new projects. This does two things:</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensures Sweeten contractors are staying up-to-date with their licenses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevents Sweeten contractors from working on projects until their licenses are up-to-date</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What kinds of contractors work with Sweeten? </b></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, Sweeten works with general contractor teams of all sizes! From single-person firms who subcontract out labor to contractors with dozens of employees on their payroll. </span></li>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Three main performance categories to consider for your contracting firm</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What’s the best way to grow your business in the new year? What are the proven strategies? What’s the most effective way to set goals?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are three performance categories to consider: <strong>Opportunities</strong>, <strong>Conversion</strong>, and <strong>Responsiveness</strong>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opportunities</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most general contracting firms need to find new clients each year. Even repeat clients rarely bring a steady stream of projects. To win an acceptable number of new clients, you need exposure to the right number of prospective clients. You will also need exposure to the right <i>kinds</i> of prospective clients. You want clients who have projects suited to your services, who have an adequate budget, and who are serious and prepared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting your firm in front of the right clients saves valuable time—you’ll spend more time doing paid work, and less time discussing projects and making site visits that go nowhere. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversion</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Of the prospective clients who see your profile, how many ask for an introduction?  Looking at your Introductions, how many clients request a site visit? Of the jobs you bid on, how many do you win?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Working backwards like this will show you what numbers you need, as well as where you might want to improve your performance. Tracking these numbers will also help your Sweeten account manager make valuable strategy suggestions. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Responsiveness</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">How quickly do you respond to new matches? To messages from prospective clients?</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow responses are one of the most common reasons prospective clients give for declining a general contractor. Quick, enthusiastic, professional communication inspires a homeowner’s trust. Slow or unengaged responses suggest that you’ll be hard to work with or that you’re not interested in the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the easiest ways to get a jump on your competitors: respond more quickly than they do. At Sweeten, we’re constantly improving our communication tools, to make responding as fast and easy as possible.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/my/performance"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47210" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Performance-Page-Blog-Button.png" alt="" width="331" height="48" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Performance-Page-Blog-Button.png 331w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Performance-Page-Blog-Button-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The 5 factors general contractors should consider when picking a site to partner with</span></h2>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48301 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Now is the time to be careful about which jobs you consider, estimate, and take on. Whether you’re looking to grow your business, provide consistency, or focus on niche projects, it’s important to have the right tools to help prioritize your funnel and be more efficient with your time. We encourage you to consider the unique needs of your general contracting business when evaluating the different kinds of business development sites/lead generation for contractors (of course we’re biased and think <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> is the best!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are the top five factors to consider when choosing a lead generation site to partner with:</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1"><b>1. Does the site charge you upfront, or only if you sign the job?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three basic ways that lead generation platforms can make money: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-to-play: The platform charges you for every potential client they send your way. Costs vary depending on the size of the potential project or quality of the lead. Sites like HomeAdvisor and Porch operate with this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-for-placement: the platform charges you for better or more frequent placement on their site. The platform typically also charges either an annual/monthly fee or a fee for every potential client they send your way. Sites like Houzz and Angi follow this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win: The platform charges you only when you sign a contract with the potential client. The fee is typically a percentage of the project value. Sites that follow this model are considered true marketplaces, because money doesn’t change hands unless there’s a sale of services. Sweeten is one of the only sites that takes this improved approach.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win platforms tie their success to their contractors’ success. These platforms are incentivized to help their GCs win more jobs, as opposed to the other models, which make their money whether or not you succeed. With Sweeten, you only pay when you win a Sweeten project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tip</b>: Make sure you keep track of your return on investment (ROI) with any lead generation platform you may be considering. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>2. Does the site focus on serious renovation projects that require a general contractor, or on handyman tasks?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before signing up with a platform, find out the average size of its projects. Look for a focus that aligns with the work you do, and the work you’re seeking. Many platforms specialize in projects that average just a few thousand dollars. At Sweeten, our average project size in 2019 was $126,000. About 50% of our contracts were over $50,000. Our minimum project size is $15,000. We can win you the kinds of leads that are most profitable, rather than stretching your resources thin with distracting singe-trade work. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>3. Does the site focus on the quality or the quantity of remodeling project leads?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask a representative how many leads you would typically see from the platform in a month as well as how they qualify those projects. Sweeten prescreens</span><span class="s2"> every project to make sure its scope and budget align with rates in your area</span><span class="s1">. We also educate potential clients on cost, scope and process, in order to manage expectations from the start. In addition, we support your firm on the project from introduction until the punch list is complete—because your client is our client, and your success is our success. You’ll have a dedicated Sweeten account manager who can offer support during project milestones, and help with any communication problems with our shared clients. And you’ll have access to your Sweeten dashboard, with digital tools for scope support, estimate creation, e-contracts, and digital payments.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>4. Does the site vet its contractors?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Look for a platform that cares about quality and is committed to improving the renovation process for all parties involved. If you carry a home improvement or general contractors license, insurance, and other certifications, look for a platform that sets you apart from less qualified tradespeople. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we vet every contractor who applies to our network. We accept fewer than 20%. All qualified contractors carry the proper licenses and insurance for their service area, and have a proven record of quality craftsmanship and successful projects. As a Sweeten partner, you’re part of a group of highly-qualified, talented, experienced professionals.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>5. Does the platform encourage healthy competition?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How many contractors does the platform send to each lead? Are contractors segmented by skill set, company size or services offered? Look for a platform that helps differentiate your firm from the pack! Sweeten matches each project to 3-5 general contractors who are a strong fit, based on the project type and scope. Clients love this because it offers them a manageable number of relevant choices, rather than bombarding them with dozens of questionable ones. Contractors love this because when we match you to a project, you’ll probably find it attractive. And you’ll have a genuine chance of winning. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What sets Sweeten apart from the rest?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten’s digital platform makes managing projects easier</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten’s combination of smart technology and client service means real renovations with real budgets. Our advanced matchmaking service matches each prospective project only to the most compatible general contractors. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten gets to know you and your firm’s strengths for the best fit</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a Sweeten general contractor, you won’t be thrown into a large pool of firms fighting for one project. You’ll get only qualified leads specifically suited to <i>your</i> firm. Sweeten is the best lead-generation source because it provides viable leads, a “pay only when you win model,” and dedicated support to help you succeed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Grow your contracting business by following these easy steps on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44674" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1000x667-SocialGraphic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having social media business pages enables business owners like yourself to easily grow your contracting business. These accounts will help you to establish a custom online presence in communities where your past and potential clients already spend their time. Whether you have already created pages or you are looking to start from scratch, business pages allow your audience to easily find your company, increasing the credibility of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, </span><span class="s1">a service that connects qualified <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/signup/expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors, builders, and remodelers</a> with homeowners and design professionals with renovation projects, offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this guide to help you establish an online presence. When speaking with clients, frequently referenced sites include Facebook and Instagram. Pulling together cohesive messaging and showcasing past projects on these platforms can help give your firm a leg up. Ready to grow your business’s presence on social media? </span></p>
<h3><strong>Facebook Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your profile</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before creating a Facebook business page, you must establish an individual profile on Facebook if you do not have one already. You can use an existing individual profile to create a page for your contracting business or start a new individual profile specifically for the purposes of setting up your company page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that there is some overlap in login information between company pages and individual profiles, so if you want team members to have access, it may make sense to start an individual account that is solely for business purposes. </span></p>
<p><strong>Create your business page (or clean it up!)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established an individual profile, “Create a Page” for your business. Upload a Profile Picture and Cover Photo &#8212; pages with cover photos typically get more page likes and visits! Choose photos that showcase your work and that you’d be proud to have potential clients see. This is where you want to show your best work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a profile, take some time to remove any content or posts that don’t support or strengthen your business profile. A good gut check is to ask yourself, would I show this photo to potential clients? If the answer is no, take it off your business page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Describe your services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description: Write a brief description that will appear in the search results. This is where you can let people know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they should engage with your business and what neighborhoods you operate in. What are your specialties and in-house capabilities? How will you help clients achieve their goals? Evaluate this description once a year and consider using it across your online profiles including in your Sweeten company description! </span></p>
<p><strong>Use quality pictures that showcase past work</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should choose 3 or 4 projects (like you did to join Sweeten!) that showcase your strengths and the beautiful work that your company does to get your business page started. In general, post valuable content that will resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an awesome project underway? Post photos of in-progress projects or completed projects so your audience can get a taste of your work experience. Pick a few photos and write up a few sentences to describe the scope of work that you accomplished for each project. Again use that gut check, if you wouldn’t show the photo to potential clients &#8212; don’t upload it to your page.</span></p>
<p><strong>Promote your page</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have a Facebook business page that will give potential clients a feel for your firm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When people like your page, it&#8217;s easier for others to discover it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use your other channels like your website or Sweeten profile to promote your page. You can even connect it with your firm’s Instagram account so you can update both simultaneously. Linking the page can be one way of minimizing upkeep, but remember to check in on the account at least every 6 months to make updates and add new photos of recent work.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> Updates to Grow Your Contracting Business</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Establish your account </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the Instagram app as there are many features not available on the desktop version of their site. Pick a username or “handle” that represents your business. Try to use some combination of your company name or initials and keywords for the industry (think “home,” “remodeling,” “GC,” “contractor,” etc.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you just signed up or already have a handle, switch the account to “professional” and review the privacy settings to set your account as public so potential clients can easily find your account. </span></p>
<p><strong>Define your business and a company bio</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add your company name so clients can identify or search for your firm. Write a brief company bio and try to stick to the 150 character limit. Include where you are based, and highlight your firm’s strengths, goals or accolades. </span></p>
<p><strong>Fill up the grid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick at least nine photos that you are the proudest of to get your profile off the ground. Once you’ve filled up the initial grid, you’ll have a great base to build off of. If you already have an account, consider deleting any posts that don’t support the services you are trying to convey.</span></p>
<p><strong>Provide captions for your photos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a short caption for each posted photo to let clients know why that photo is significant. Don’t be afraid to use hashtags in the caption or tag other accounts in the photo. Engaging with other accounts through hashtags, tags, and comments can help others find and follow your account. You can also add geotags so potential clients can see the general location of any projects that you post. These features can be edited or updated at any time, so they’re ideal you’re looking to refresh old posts with photos.</span></p>
<p><strong>Follow others in your industry</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sweeten_home on Instagram</a> and then follow any industry contacts that you might have, including designers, architects, subcontractors, or showrooms.

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47748 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ContractorsGuide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The process of signing a new client contains multiple steps. In addition to finding the client, you, as the contractor, have to find out the client&#8217;s budget, the scope that they want to accomplish, and when they want to start the project. Knowing these details will help determine if your firm and the client are a good fit. After that comes client meetings, estimates, and the closing. Sweeten has put together this renovation sales process guide that covers each of these phases.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> prequalifies clients for contractors, which is often the most difficult step. Sweeten’s process puts homeowners with projects in touch with the right contractor. So, when you come on board, the process of identifying possible clients is already done for you.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches <a href="https://sweeten.com/general-contractor-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractors</a> with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Additionally, contractors pay only when they win a project. Sweeten project budgets start at $15,000 and average over $100,000.</span></p>
<h3>What to do at client meetings</h3>
<p>There are many different ways to continue the sales process. Many contractors set up a meeting with the client. At the meeting, they go over the details of the project. <strong>Many contractors find these items useful to bring up at the first meeting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of the project</li>
<li>The reason for the renovation</li>
<li>The client&#8217;s timeline for the project</li>
<li>The budget</li>
<li>Reasons your firm is a good match for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting is a discussion that gives you a chance to engage with and draw out the client. Whether you meet in person initially or you have a quick call to see if you are on the same page, it is important that you be direct with the client regarding their desired timeline for the job. This will help you figure out if the client is serious or just exploring options. It will also help you develop a strategy for following up with the client.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to show you are their partner in the project. Most homeowners respond well to positive remarks from the contractor. If they want to start in six weeks, tell them what needs to be done to meet that date, or get close to it. Your positive attitude can give the client confidence in you. And it can help move the project along.</p>
<h3>Preparing the estimate</h3>
<p>Homeowners will expect a project estimate from you sooner rather than later. In fact, homeowners expect the estimate within a week or so. By telling the homeowners when they should expect the estimate, you can manage their expectations and set up a clear next checkpoint.</p>
<p>Most homeowners have questions about the estimates they receive. Many successful contractors like to set up a phone or in-person meeting to go over the estimate. Proposing a meeting for a week or two after supplying the estimate should give the homeowners time to go over it on their own. Besides answering questions, this meeting gives you a chance to reconfirm the timeline and the budget. Plus, it&#8217;s an opportunity for more client contact (which is always a good thing!)</p>
<p>Getting the estimate to the client quickly gives time for revisions. This is especially important for clients who expect a quick start to the project.</p>
<h3>Clients who won&#8217;t commit</h3>
<p>Everyone has experienced clients who drag their feet once they have the estimate. This is where your earlier conversations with the client can pay off. Knowing their timeline allows you to show your expertise and help move the process along. One way to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remind them that to meet their deadline, items need to be ordered now or in the near future.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some clients will stop communicating with the contractor completely. It&#8217;s frustrating! But if you have done your job up to this point, there is nothing wrong with asking point-blank questions. For example, you can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Do you want to continue with the project?&#8221; </strong></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Are you still considering my firm?&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Yes” answers to those questions will move the project along. No one wants to hear a no, but at least a “no” answer means you can stop wasting your time and focus on other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>To help with difficult clients, Sweeten has a team that keeps in contact with the clients. They can help you get answers to those questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The payoff to the steps above is to get the client to commit, so you can finally start the renovation process.</p>
