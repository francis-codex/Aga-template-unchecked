<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An old Los Angeles garage finds new use</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d been living in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our house</a> for about three years when we started the garage remodel. The home, built in 1936 and located in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles, is a bungalow-style cottage. The most recent appraisal said it comprised 690 square feet; the unattached <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage added an additional 260</a> square feet of “unofficial” usable space. In a house this small, you can’t afford to take a single square foot for granted. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My partner, Tom, and I both work in research administration at the University of California at Los Angeles; I recently completed a certificate for interior design and am in the midst of changing careers. We knew we could benefit from a secondary live-work area. We realized the garage could be it, and that transforming the space could be a rewarding project.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Hiring a general contractor with Sweeten</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Knowing we would renovate the garage, we’d agreed it would have to be phase two. We made the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first round of renovations</a> out of sheer necessity after buying the house with a long list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural and systemic issues</a>. The experience of trying to line up dependable contractors had been stressful—even getting quotes. We’d hired the one contractor we could pin down. It was that experience that prompted us to <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with Sweeten</a> this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg" alt="Natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52339" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage work space and orange leather couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52349" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We renovated the garage when we did because we planned to sell the house. But working from home during Covid made us realize that room to spread out would benefit us while we still lived there. We posted our project and waited to see <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which contractors were interested</a> in taking on a garage remodel in Los Angeles.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspecting the garage&#8217;s structure</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The job wouldn’t be easy. We needed to solve the garage’s long-standing structural issues. The building was more than 80 years old; the roof had begun to sag and we were unsure of the extent of the damage. Perhaps the job would involve replacing the ceiling’s support beams and installing a new door. Or it might require an entire rebuild. We needed someone to inspect the structure and advise us of what was needed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, that wasn’t as difficult as we anticipated. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor we chose determined that the original beams had been too narrow, and spaced too far apart, to fully support the garage’s ceiling. He also informed us that the two existing single-car garage doors were rotting away and termite-ridden. Our biggest question was, “Do we have enough money” to fix the problems? Turned out the answer was yes, and then some!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg" alt="Garage white cabinets with television" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52348" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Creating a new living/working space in the garage</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had several goals beyond shoring up the garage. First, we wanted to replace the existing two one-car garage doors with a fully automated two-car door. Second, we needed to install a new outlet for plugging in our electric car charger. Finally, we sought to create a space that would be more than a storage area—as comfortable as our living room, but (because local building codes required it) still functional as a garage. No layout changes would be necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided to give the space the look of a loft. We envisioned exposed wood beams lining the ceilings, crisp white walls, and a lot of natural light. In keeping with that aesthetic, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used a lot of the existing materials</a>, including the wood ceiling beams (they are the actual structural supports that already existed with some additional wood reinforcing them) and the original concrete slab floor (we filled in cracks with a special cement caulk and painted it gray).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom doors for a small space</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One big challenge was the garage door. We have discovered that with a small house comes the joy of everything being undersized and therefore not standard. Doors and windows had needed customization, and the garage door was no different—it was narrower than the norm. In addition, we discovered that the garage floor sloped, necessitating a custom panel on the bottom of the door that sloped side-to-side with the floor, ensuring a weatherproof seal. The panel, though surprisingly expensive, has been worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls offered no straight lines, either, but our drywall installer was a true artist. The walls looked so smooth for a dwelling built in 1936, that has been flexing and shifting with every earthquake for the last 80 years. There wasn’t a single straight, vertical wall, and some bowed or curved. The cabinets</span><span class="s9"> </span><span class="s1">provided a good deal of storage and brought a domestic air to what might otherwise just feel like a garage. The countertop is an unfinished pine board and is, like the ceiling, a little rustic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg" alt="natural toned garage living room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52350" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg" alt="Blue garage with closed door" width="1000" height="618" class="alignnone wp-image-52359 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-300x185.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-01-1-600x371.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">The right contractor for a garage remodel in Los Angeles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor had a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear communication style</a> and was immensely helpful throughout the process. We could always count on him to respond promptly when we sent him a text or email. More often than not he’d call us back to talk via phone, which I appreciated. He kept us informed of when the subcontractors were going to be working and who specifically would be at our house. And best of all, he stayed on budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our contractor was so good that we didn’t need Sweeten&#8217;s support too much. But it was nice to know that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten was there</a></span><span class="s1"> if we needed them. It was like knowing you have an insurance policy in case of problems; you hope to never use it, but it gives you peace of mind knowing it’s there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The space in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new garage</a> feels generous and comfortable, and the light inside is beautiful throughout the day because of all the windows. The built-in cabinets are attractive (the black pulls provide a nice contrast to the white and wood surfaces in the room) and also bring a ton of much-needed storage. Even though the garage is now a living space, we also needed to make sure there were attractive places to store things.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right time to renovate</h3>
<p>We’ve all walked into homes where two different sets of ideas are in play. This renovation was part of a quest for cohesion. We’d established an aesthetic when we’d updated the kitchen two years before, and we were now putting in a bathroom and closet we could love. The old set of ideas included a showerhead on the long side of the bathtub and pitch-dark storage spaces. We were not sad to see them go.</p>

<p>We are Kate, a creative director for a women’s wellness startup, Max, a data analyst at a tech firm, and Lenny, a female Pitbull/Rat Terrier mix. We live in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a 1926 co-op building. We’re first-time homeowners of a 610-square-foot one-bedroom apartment. We purchased in January 2016 as first-time buyers. We didn’t change the place until 2019 when we renovated the kitchen.</p>
<p>We planned to wait to continue renovating, but the combination of being home due to Covid-19 and having few opportunities to spend money meant that we wanted a nicer place and we accelerated our savings plan. We decided to go for it this year and renovate the bathroom and our closet as a single project.</p>
<h3>Swapping out the tub for a shower</h3>
<p>Remodeling the 35-square-foot bathroom was a style choice, but also one of function. In the existing room, neither the floor nor the walls were level. We hated that the shower head was in the middle of the wall on the tub’s long side. We wanted a modern stand-up shower with a glass door instead of the step-in tub and wraparound shower curtain. The closet redo made sense to tack on because of its proximity to the bathroom. We wanted to combine two small adjacent closets—one accessible from the bedroom, the other from the hallway—into a single large one. Neither closet had electrical wiring, so finding our things was a challenge. We knew we could net more storage if we merged them into one large closet.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This was easily the most challenging phase of the project, since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Creating a whole new bathroom layout</h3>
<p>We started in the bathroom. We rearranged the whole bathroom, so this was not a simple “rip and replace.” Moving the shower to the back wall meant relocating the toilet and reconfiguring the plumbing proved necessary. Our biggest questions were about the unknowns. In a nutshell, here’s what we learned: You can’t prepare for what’s behind a wall or under the floor. You carry out the demolition and hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>We’d decided we wanted white subway tile with a dark gray grout on the walls. The floor tiles had a distressed texture in dark gray. The vanity’s light wood finish matches our kitchen cabinets, and it offers tons of storage even though it’s only a 24-inch unit. The toilet search was more challenging than expected since we had specific size requirements, but eventually, we found one we liked.</p>
<h3>The contractor handles the discovery under the subfloor</h3>
<p>We’d heard plenty of nightmares about people moving plumbing in New York City bathrooms and hoped our fate might be different, but it wasn’t. Having completed most of the demolition, the contractors lifted the floor tile. Beneath the visible layer, they discovered two additional layers of tile. Once the subfloor was exposed, it was clear it had been compromised, both by years of trapped moisture and the weight of those three tile layers.</p>

<p>The co-op&#8217;s engineer brought onsite recommended pouring a new concrete slab, which added expense and impacted our schedule. This was easily the most challenging phase of the project since we’d left Brooklyn on a road trip and were far away when the contractor discovered the problem. We didn’t need to worry. Our contractor worked with the building’s engineer to pour the new slab to the required specifications.</p>
<h3>Smooth communication with their contractor</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors provided us with updates via an online project-management tool that <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped with communication throughout the job</a>. The team used the tool to share photo and video updates. It helped to keep everyone in sync and organized. That platform really streamlined the conversation regarding every aspect of the job. The bathroom came together exactly as we’d hoped. We’re thrilled with the new storage, including an inset bottle nook in the shower. And the rain showerhead combined with our building’s incredible water pressure makes for an immersive experience every morning.</p>
<h3>Combining closets for a larger one</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-remodel-your-closet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded bedroom closet</a> came next. The contractors removed the wall separating the two smaller closets in order to merge them; we kept the door on the bedroom side. I love being able to see things in the closet, thanks to the increased space, and the addition of wiring let us install good lighting. For the shelving, we took a hybrid approach, buying all of the parts separately. The white shelves are typical closet shelves, but the racks are meant for garage storage. We can finally find our clothes!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="walk-in-closet-with-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="small custom walk-in closet storage with shelves after renovation" width="800" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51190" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/65929-Max-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This closet hack would also mean addressing the hallway with trim and paint. On that side, the contractors closed the door opening and painted the wall, where we later created a gallery wall for art and photos. The previous door trim was missing chunks of wood (likely from people moving big objects in/out of rooms and banging into the door frame.) It had also been painted a million times and was generally an eyesore. We knew replacing the door and window trim would go a long way towards refreshing the space. The red light fixture provides a nice pop of color.</p>

<h3>Their Sweeten contractors: the right renovation partners</h3>
<p>This was a much larger project than we thought we’d be taking on this year, but it worked out beautifully. Our Sweeten contractors were transparent about billing, supplying us with perfectly itemized invoices. They were terrific problem solvers, with elegant design sense and ideas that enhanced our final results. We love our new apartment!</p>

While most home renovations focus on the kitchen and bath, the bedroom is arguably just as important. Although bedrooms are key spaces for retreating from the stress of everyday life, they&#8217;re often deprioritized during renovations. Updating a master bedroom—even with simple refreshes—can have an outsize impact on how we enjoy our homes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re seeking master bedroom ideas to guide your design dreams, look no further! These Sweeten renovators turned the spotlight on their own master bedrooms, using unique design approaches to refresh their favorite space in the house.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</p>
<h3>A Hollywood star&#8217;s much-needed nook</h3>

<p>Dreaming of a special, cozy place to call your own? If you have the room and your space is configured correctly, consider adding a reading nook. They are great places to allow you to relax and unwind. Plus, they look beautiful as well. For <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> actress <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaime Ray Newman,</a> a geometric-patterned bench provided not only a nice nook but a statement piece in her master bedroom. With natural sunlight beaming through and luxurious curtains, who wouldn&#8217;t want to curl up with a good book and spend a relaxing afternoon?</p>
<h3>Bedroom accent walls draw the eye</h3>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49071 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg" alt="master bedroom with black and white painted mural behind bed" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bedroom-28-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>): A custom mural as a bedroom accent wall</span></p>
<p>Making a bold design statement is always an in-vogue idea in any master bedroom. A statement or accent wall has been around for a while—and they are not going anywhere. You can add an accent color with paint. Or, take it up a notch with a paneling.  <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolio/black-steel-accented-dining-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovators Mitzie and Jenifer </a>decided on blue paneling to give the room depth and character. The wall also turned attention away from existing buildouts in each corner of the room and a recessed area that could not be reconfigured.  Also, in case you were wondering, the contractor used satin-finish paint to make the wall pop even more.</p>
<p>And yet another <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten renovator</a> decided to add an accent wall—a customized one. An artist, Katy decided to use her creativity in the design. She painted a bold, black-and-white brush-stroke mural behind the bed. &#8220;Seeing my murals and paintings transform the house has been incredible,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h3>Built-in shelves flank the bed</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43898 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg" alt="Attic master bedroom with custom built-in shelves surrounding bed" width="1000" height="665" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kusum-MasterBedroom-9-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Built-ins are not just for the library or living room. Including built-in shelves to a master bedroom not only helps with storage but adds a point of interest. In the master bedroom above, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovate-attic-pelham-westchester-new-topper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homeowners Kusum and David</a> asked their Sweeten contractor to install custom built-ins since they were limited on space. They decided on open shelving with a drawer at the bottom in order to maximize the storage potential. In addition, the odd-shaped room also called for a built-in dresser to utilize every nook and cranny.</p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall wallpaper</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39881 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg" alt="master bedroom with textured tan hemp wallpaper" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Wallpaper is an easy way to elevate the design of any master bedroom. The key to <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picking the right one</a> really lies in your personal aesthetic. Overall, stay true to your style, whether that&#8217;s bold or more subtle. Another approach to consider is selecting textured wallpaper, which adds a sense of movement and purpose. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator</a> (above) went for a hemp-textured wallpaper. Specifically:  Bermuda Hemp in Elephant #5260 from <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phillip Jeffries</a>.  No matter which paper you choose, keep true to your design aesthetic and you won&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h3>Minimalist master bedrooms go clean and simple</h3>

<p>Sometimes keeping it simple is best. That usually translates to neutral colors, minimal furniture, and little ornamentation on the walls. Another bonus of the less-is-more approach: having a space that is mostly clutter-free can make you calm and more relaxed. Ultimately, that&#8217;s just what a bedroom should be—a serene, inviting space. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-time-condo-renovation-flatiron/">Sweeten renovator Whitney</a>, that was exactly her vision. She chose light wood flooring that appears to reflect the incoming sunlight, having an illuminating effect on the bedroom. White walls are accented by a black window frame. Art is leaned up against the wall instead of hung. And little furniture works to make the space more open. This master bedroom is just the right combination of minimalism and style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten renovator Kirsty</a> had the same idea: minimal all the way. When she redid her house in Los Angeles, she, too, wanted a clean aesthetic, especially for her bedroom. She achieved this through natural wood doors and headboard as well as little to no furniture in the room. She used artwork to draw the eye in but it is also in neutral tones and hues.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchens are tight spaces, so, it helps to thoroughly plan every square foot before starting a remodel. Kitchens also are complex spaces where many elements must meet code. Supply and drain pipes compete with wires, ducts, and cabinets. The kitchen is not the place for last-minute, informal planning. Where should you start when considering different kitchen layout ideas? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Simply: homeowners should consider using the most common layouts found in kitchens. There are many benefits of starting with a tried-and-true layout in your kitchen: smooth traffic flow, and less wasted space. Additionally, kitchen functionalities</span><span class="s2">—sink, stove, fridge, and dishwasher—will end up in sensible places. Ultimately, this saves money for routing plumbing and electrical work. </span>Below you&#8217;ll find renovations by Sweeten homeowners with kitchen layout inspiration.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Island kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen with black island and ceiling height storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/117375-Anthony-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Anthony and Jeremiah&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/plywood-kitchen-is-loaded-with-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen island renovation</a></span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An island kitchen layout combines <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen island with other layouts</a>. These may be an L-shaped, U-shaped, or one-wall kitchen layout. The kitchen island is separate from the main counter area.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many kitchen islands are counters only, with no water or cooking action. If a service is added to the island, it’s usually a cooktop. Large island kitchens may have a cooktop and a second sink for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands may be used less frequently than the owner had originally imagined. So, it helps to add one of those services as a magnet. Or, some homeowners extend one end of the island for use as an eating bar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Additional counter space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Less expensive (you can even use a mobile island)<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to bring water supply and drainage to an island<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Takes up a lot of space, so a large kitchen is required</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1"></ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">U-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-30373 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg" alt="u-shaped kitchen with gray cabinets and marble waterfall peninsula" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_PeterWeiss_DuplexLoft12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-shaped kitchen</a> remodel</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A U-shaped kitchen layout expands the L-shaped layout by adding an extra wing. Instead of two counters, the U-shaped kitchen has three counters arranged like a U.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the U-shaped kitchen, various functions can be better spaced out than with the L-shaped layout. So, the leg of the L-shape that has the fridge, sink, and dishwasher can be broken up. The U-shaped kitchen’s third leg might contain the fridge.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For a U-shaped kitchen, you’ll need to have enough floor space available, but not too much. If the space is too small, the kitchen is cramped. If it’s too large, it takes longer to walk from one area to another. The <a href="https://nkba.org/"><span class="s3">National Kitchen + Bath Association</span></a> recommends that no leg of the work triangle be less than 4 feet or more than 9 feet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the third wall<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Spreads out kitchen services<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficulty correctly sizing the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Center must be kept free of obstacles<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">One-wall kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-56617 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Kitchen with blue cabinets and chevron backsplash" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/122175-Tiffany-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-wall kitchen</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the one-wall kitchen layout, all of the kitchen tasks are combined on a single counter against one wall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since they are all in a line, design is mainly a matter of deciding the order of the functionalities. Usually, the sink and dishwasher are next to each other to share the water supply and drain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Of the 6 kitchen layout ideas, the U-shape works perfectly for smaller homes such as condos or apartments. However, you’ll want to keep the layout fairly short. This avoids too much movement from one end to the other end.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Squeezes kitchen into tiny space<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Keeps plumbing and electrical in one area<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Too much walking if the layout is long<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Little counter space<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Galley kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38056 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg" alt="white galley kitchen with gold drawer pulls" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;"> (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheilaja + Sergio&#8217;s renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens have two counters that run parallel to each other. The counters are divided by a single aisle. Galley kitchens’ namesake is the kitchen found on boats. True to the inspiration, the aisle is usually narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With galley kitchens, often one leg is devoted to the stove or cooktop and counter space. The other leg is usually the home’s exterior wall and has the sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Galley kitchens do a great job of confining the workflow to a tight space. Just make sure that the cabinet, fridge, dishwasher, and oven doors don’t conflict with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Tucks kitchen away, off to the side<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short traffic pattern<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Poor layout for multiple people in the kitchen<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Doors may conflict or open into each other<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Peninsula kitchen layout</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20126 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg" alt="peninsula kitchen layout with see-through kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label" style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalal + Frans&#8217; renovation</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A peninsula kitchen layout is a U-shaped layout that has a counter extension. Located at either end of the U shape, the extension partially juts into the kitchen. The result is generally a G-shape.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This kitchen usually retains its activities in its U-shaped section. The extension then becomes a breakfast bar or eating counter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The outer part of the extension can take two or three chairs for eating. The inner (kitchen side) is less functional. Most of it becomes a blind-corner cabinet that’s difficult for storing items. One solution is to install a lazy-susan, swing-out, or pull-out in that corner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Utilizes the end of a run of cabinets<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Room for eating saves on the need for chairs and table<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Creates another blind-corner cabinet<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Short counter<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No matter the size of your home, there’s a kitchen layout that&#8217;ll fit the space. Keep in mind the kitchen activities that are important to your lifestyle, plot the best layout and flow, and get ready for your dream cook space.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">L-shaped kitchen layout</span></h3>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An L-shaped kitchen layout has two counters laid at a 90-degree angle to each other. Often, one counter is longer than the other counter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The L-shaped kitchen layout usually divides the kitchen activities across the two legs of the L-shape. One leg may have the refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher. The other leg may have the stove or cooktop, plus a majority of the counter space for prep work.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There are many reasons that an L-shaped kitchen layout is a good idea for your home.<span class="s1"> For one, L-shaped kitchens are flexible enough to fit in kitchens of different sizes. For another, this layout lends itself perfectly to the <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kitchen-triangle-best-way-to-design-a-kitchen"><span class="s3">concept of the kitchen triangle</span></a>. With this, the sink, stove, and fridge are arranged in a triangle for better workflow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>PROS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Flexible, works for many kitchens<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Good use of the kitchen triangle<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>CONS</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Large kitchens can get too spread out<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Difficult to find space for counter eating</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Start with the right kitchen layout ideas</h3>
<p class="p1">Cooking in a space with the right floorplan can prove to be the result of a well-planned kitchen remodel. With workflows in mind, everything from preparing ingredients to cleaning up can be done in a more streamlined fashion. The &#8220;work triangle” reduces the number of steps needed to move between the appliances. By having the right design, you are on your way to an enjoyable cooking experience.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about kitchen layouts</h3>
<h4><b>How to design a kitchen layout?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing the right kitchen layout is dependent upon the homeowner and the home. When choosing a kitchen layout, the homeowner first has to recognize what space they are working with. They should also think about what they need in their kitchen, and what will be the most useful to them. Would it be best for the kitchen to have an open layout? Or, should it include an island or peninsula? The homeowner has to think of the pros and cons, but also what is actually possible. A small galley kitchen is not going to fit a big island, while a big L-shaped kitchen might look empty without one.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is the best layout for a small kitchen?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley layout</a>, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-wall layout</a>, or <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula layout</a> work all well for small kitchens. A galley kitchen can be tucked away in tight spaces, and there is a short traffic pattern. Including a peninsula in the kitchen means that there does not have to be room for a table and chairs. Stools can be added to the peninsula in order to make a tabletop. A one-wall kitchen layout makes it so everything in the kitchen can be compact on one side, and may open up into a living area. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>

<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20185 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Making your galley kitchen bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The key to making your galley kitchen inspiration successful is all about maximizing the available square footage. But when you&#8217;ve optimized every inch and <em>still</em> need more space, the question becomes: <strong>how do you make a galley kitchen bigger?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Demolishing the entire kitchen and its surrounding walls is not always a realistic option. Bringing down walls partially provides some openness while not eliminating all walls which are important for storage. Another way to expand a galley kitchen layout is by allowing the kitchen to extend into nearby living spaces. See how the five Sweeten renovations below snuck in a little more outside their two walls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A countertop extension perfect for parties</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-24796" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of taking down walls to open things up, Joel and Eric worked with their designers to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wraparound kitchen countertop</a> to join the kitchen and nearby dining room. The one-piece counter is perfect for hosting parties: it provides a spot for pouring drinks and serving buffet-style dinners without leaving the kitchen. As a bonus, the extended storage helps mitigate the build-up of clutter.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Simple solution: a pass-through</h3>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="built in oven in a kitchen pass through" width="2000" height="3000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-07-1170x1755.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Gina and Andrew’s kitchen was closed off from the rest of their apartment. As a layout, being closed off isn’t always undesired. However, the couple wanted to move beyond their dark galley kitchen, which also had an awkward layout. Their plans required moving a load-bearing wall. Therefore, architectural drawings needed to be submitted for approval. It was worth it for their Sweeten contractor to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-seat breakfast bar</a> (and fit a stackable washer and dryer). The pass-through gave a new dimension to the galley layout. It also created a welcomed social aspect between the kitchen and dining area. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>A patio comes inside</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43703 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg" alt="bay window" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Laura-kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laura and Tim were ready to trade in their “old and grungy” kitchen in their 1929 brick townhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  They </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-patio-house-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remodeled their galley kitchen</a> and kept the layout—with one major change. They enclosed an outdoor patio at the back of the kitchen that had a drafty door which was also poorly located. The new plan was to envelop the patio into the cook space and the adjacent dining area. What started as a kitchen remodel turned into a full-blown extension project. A skylight in the new enclosure brought in a stream of natural light.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Galley kitchen inspiration: Turn the corner</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28650 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Melissa and Blake's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Melissa-Tavvs_Apartment-11-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shifting the location of a nearby closet allowed Melissa and Blake to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/convertible-one-bedroom-scores-big-points/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enlarge the galley kitchen</a> into the living room. This created space for more cabinets, a wine rack, and counter space. Their Sweeten contractor removed a second closet also outside the kitchen and built a bar counter with seating in its place. By &#8220;turning the corners&#8221; off the galley, the couple gained a lot more kitchen space.</p>
<h3>Separating the dining area from the kitchen</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27107 size-chrono" title="Lisa and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg" alt="how to make a galley kitchen bigger" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Christopher_Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
Moving the eating nook outside of the kitchen allowed Lisa and Chris to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extend their cabinets</a> along the back wall. The sink and stove remained in the same locations. However, the fridge was relocated allowing the opposite wall to have a long continuous countertop. A part of the wall was partially removed to create a large, eat-in peninsula. The extremely cramped galley kitchen now felt more open and organized.</p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>

<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>

<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

<h3>Changing the entire floor plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our apartment, which was built in 1912, had almost all of the original details still intact. It was important for us to keep this character while adding a more usable kitchen and bathroom. The first objective was to get rid of the long hallway, which was tying up roughly 10% of the apartment. An added bonus: opening up the floor plan would bring more light in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34515 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg" alt="Park Slope homeowners Laura and Walter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>A new angle for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we wanted to expand the footprint of the kitchen. ­The existing layout was <em>not</em> working: it was impossible to open the oven door without running into the sink. It was also difficult for more than one person to be in the space at a time. Everyone wound up standing in the doorway to the kitchen. We posted our Park Slope apartment gut renovation on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and got to work with our contractor.</p>

<blockquote><p>Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, the original kitchen and center bedroom were swapped. The apartment layout included a small angled section of wall in the center bedroom—now our kitchen. Enter our Sweeten contractor, who had this idea when he came to our apartment for the initial meeting. It was one of the primary reasons we decided to work with him. His instinct was to embrace this angle and open up the new kitchen more than the traditional 90-degree corner would allow. We lost a bit of floor space in our bedroom as a result, but the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
<p>We were able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include both a peninsula</a> and a dining nook in the new spacious layout. A bookshelf fits at the end of the peninsula closest to the living room.</p>

<h3>Custom built-in cabinets are key</h3>
<p>Given that we wanted to squeeze five rooms and a bathroom out of our apartment, it was important that every room was laid out as efficiently as possible. The various <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built­-ins we added</a> allowed us to accomplish just that.</p>
<p>The built-in cabinets around the dining nook and drawers under the seating bench hide a ton of additional storage. Coming from our narrow galley kitchen, we were really excited to have a space big enough for us and our friends to hang out and cook in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34497 mb-0 size-full" title="white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" alt="white and blue kitchen cabinets with breakfast nook and built in bench after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space. Lowering the ceiling had the added benefit of the apartment drawing you in. It made the rest of the apartment feel spacious by comparison—a design trick inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #333333;">The den&#8217;s millwork could fit a full-size bed for the future.</span> </span>In our bedroom, the closets around the bed double as nightstands with­ the upper drawers on each side containing a hidden outlet.</p>

<h3>Choosing materials</h3>
<p>The footprint of our bathroom couldn&#8217;t be enlarged because of the location of the windows and the building plumbing. In order to maximize the space, we opted for a shorter tub to fit under the window, a wall-mounted toilet to free up floor space, and a wall-mounted faucet, which gives more counters space around the sink.</p>

<p>Our goal was to use natural materials as much as possible. The oak floors were a tribute to the original parquet floors (we tried to save them, but they were too thin for another sanding). We designed and cast our own concrete sink (in a small rented workshop in Industry City) to fit perfectly. The subway tiles in the kitchen and bathroom were handmade, as were the dining nook pendants—all adding subtle character and texture to the spaces. We opted for a marbled quartz countertop and think it will last much better than the real thing.</p>
<h3>Renovation tip: Order materials early</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of unexpected situations arose: an old dumbwaiter shaft ran through our proposed kitchen, the floor joists needed replacing, and the gas pipe had to be re­run from the basement passing through three other apartments. In retrospect, none of these things should have been surprising in an old building. Our Sweeten contractor was with us every step of the way to modify our plans to deal with the unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My best tip for future renovators is to have all the fixtures with long lead times and finishes ordered before the work begins. Nothing pushes back a project deadline like waiting for materials or having all work stop because the tiles are still on the truck.</p>

<p>In the end, we were able to keep the things we loved most about our original apartment while making significant improvements to our home for now and in the future. There are so many things we can enjoy now. The kitchen has become the center of our apartment, with friends able to hang out in the dining nook or living room while still being part of the conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The glass partition helps bring a ton of light into the apartment. The bathroom has gone from tight-for­-one to comfortable-­for­-two. We were very lucky to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a partner in our Sweeten contractor</a>. After living in the completed apartment, we’ve yet to find anything we’d change.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Guest post by homeowner Michelle</em></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My journey down the renovation rabbit hole began when I found myself picturing the dilapidated garage in the backyard as my dream “diva den,” as my best friend calls it. While researching different designs and models, I remembered an article on Sweeten I&#8217;d read a few years ago and had always wanted to use their services. It seemed like a no-brainer to have an intermediary help locate vetted contractors. It also solved the huge question of where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was my first ever renovation project, I had no idea what my renovation would cost. Sweeten helped me modify my scope of work and nail down a realistic budget. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced me to a few contractors</a> who were a good match for my project. I finally felt like I had a team behind me, which is great once you start writing big checks.</p>

<h3>Planning the &#8220;she shed&#8221; garage remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew instantly that the first Sweeten contractor I met was the right fit for the job. Finally, I found someone as excited about my garage as I was! At that stage, I only had a basic idea of what I wanted. We took down most of the existing structure, retaining only the foundation. Since I was renovating a 12&#8242; x 19&#8242; garage, I wanted the interior to be basic and for the structure to retain the identity and functionality of a garage. That meant concrete floors, no molding, and a statement-making garage door. If you took out the rugs and furniture of the she shed, the structure could have use as a garage or workspace. I also wanted a calming space with one stipulation: no white walls.</p>
<h3>Experiencing a real-life renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with everyone on my contractor’s team was amazing. I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way. Most importantly, nobody exposed me for the complete novice that I was. Gaining an understanding of how everything worked also helped reign in some of my design ideas. To top off the contractor’s great service, he downloaded WhatsApp to stay in touch with me when I left for Cuba mid-project. I greatly appreciated his dedication to my peace of mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather was one of the biggest challenges during my project. It wasn’t an issue when my project started in August. However, when November arrived, it was either too cold, too rainy, or was supposed to rain but didn’t. Either way, there were a few bad weather days that halted work on The Shak. My contractor also had to juggle other clients. In my naiveté, I thought contractors worked on one project at a time. I came to understand that The Shak was my highest priority, but contractors work on other dream projects at the same time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25862 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-07-09.gif" alt="ladder to garage attic" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Building a ladder to the attic</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the exterior took shape, and the interior work began, I became more involved in the project. That is also when my attention to detail heightened. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage, we utilized the space</a>, we utilized the space above the ceiling. How to access that space became an hour-long discussion. I asked the contractor and his partner how I would get up to the storage space. &#8220;Use a ladder,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That’s what I do in my garage.&#8221; I’m no mathematician, but a nine-foot-tall ceiling plus a five-foot-tall girl does not equal easy movement of big boxes up a six-foot ladder. And where would I keep this ladder when I wasn’t using it? After a bit of selling on my part, they agreed to install an attic ladder. It was worth hashing out and in the end, my contractors loved the ladder too.</p>
<blockquote><p>I asked questions that clearly came from watching copious amounts of home improvement TV. Everyone was extremely patient and explained why things are done a certain way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personalizing the &#8220;she shed&#8221; bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound weird, but finding my dry-flush toilet was exciting. The she shed did not seem usable to me if you had to keep going into the house to use the bathroom. After endlessly searching for a toilet that did not need to be hooked up to sewage lines or have an odor, I came across a dry flush toilet. It is a great invention. It works like a Diaper Genie disposal system with a continuous bag that self-seals when “flushed,” then, a new portion of the bag opens for use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the bathroom is a small 3’ x 4’ space, I definitely wanted some over-the-top designs on the walls. I initially thought of using three-dimensional self-adhesive wall panels but decided against that since I wanted a mix of color and patterns. As a naturally curly-haired girl, the print I chose was a perfect fit for my preference of streamlined chaos.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25844 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg" alt="garage bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Michelle_Shed-06-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A tip on DIY wallpaper hanging</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, by the time I found the mural, the contractors had completed the interior space. So, my best friend and I enrolled in the university that is YouTube. After watching about twenty videos, we felt qualified to hang wallpaper, something neither of us had ever done before. I love what we accomplished, but some things take more skill and patience than she or I possess. I will never hang wallpaper again.</p>
<h3>Ultra-bold backsplash tiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the contractor installed the sink and countertop, my <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next big project was the backsplash</a>. I wanted something different and eye-catching, something that would not bore me. I came across graffiti tiles but the designs weren&#8217;t bold enough. After feeling empowered with my new construction knowledge, I decided to decoupage my own tiles. We figured out the dimensions for the backsplash and measured out 5&#8242; x 2&#8242; worth of decoupage tiles as well as some purchased ones. It is one of my favorite things in The Shak. Now, when my friends come over, they all choose their favorite tile. I love how they invite interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have never embarked on a project of this size. At times, it was scary. I would get a call at 8 a.m. from my contractor, asking <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which direction I wanted the French doors</a> to open or what size I wanted the windows to be, with no clue of how to respond. My advice to anyone starting a project would be to pick a contractor that listens to your ideas. It is also helpful to watch some YouTube videos, home improvement shows, or however else you like to educate yourself. The more a homeowner knows, the better he or she can direct the construction of their masterpiece. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with everything I accomplished in making The Shak a reality.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Michelle, for sharing the story of your she shed, The Shak with us! We hope it brings joy and relaxation.</i></p>

<h3>A charming (but not functional) Colonial house</h3>
<p>We had been dividing our time between a farmhouse in Dutchess County and a walk-up apartment in Brooklyn. When our son was born, neither of these homes was quite suited to us. We decided to find a place in between with a shorter commute for my husband, more social opportunities for me, and easy access to the home.</p>

<p>When we first saw the house, we were charmed by the time-capsule of a kitchen—salmon Formica, dark-wood cabinets, and a dishwasher that predated the other elements. That said, we knew we would eventually update the kitchen. Having a lavatory on the ground floor and not having to run upstairs was also on the wishlist.</p>

<h3>Their Colonial renovation adds heated floors</h3>
<p>The existing kitchen had one radiator, which was buried in the back of a custom cabinet. It was a clever solution at the time, but ate up a lot of cabinet space and wasn’t heat-efficient. We decided to install a radiant floor heating system that we could run off of our existing hot-water heating system. A more formal, fully-functional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island would offer storage</a>, outlets, and a bigger counter area.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted to create a better flow of traffic and light. The main entrance to the kitchen from the dining room was a narrow 28-inch-wide doorway. It made the kitchen feel isolated from the rest of the house. Bringing down the wall would not have respected the house’s character. Instead, the opening was widened and centered between the two rooms to bring more natural light into the north-facing kitchen. </span></p>

<p>Some infrastructural elements dictated a lot of the design. One was that the major waste line for the three upstairs bathrooms lays along the kitchen’s exterior wall. It had been boxed out previously, and the existing cabinets had been customized around it. We didn’t want to relocate that line, so we decided to figure out how to incorporate it.</p>
<p>The second element was a sheetrock box beam of sorts. We didn’t know what was in it, but since it was asymmetrically placed and not detailed like the house’s other box beams, we assumed it was hiding something expensive to move. Our thought was, let’s give this weird beam and column matching mates to create symmetry.</p>
<h3>Odd-ball elements</h3>
<p>These design decisions hid the two odd-ball elements by making it look like they’d always been there. Bonus: We made that second column a sneaky little cabinet right between the sink/dishwasher and our espresso machine. It’s the perfect spot for drinking glasses and cups. We love it!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48250" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amanda-kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p>I wanted to bring the warmth and softness of natural wood into the kitchen, so I chose a darker wood for the cabinets that echoes our furniture. A built-in pantry was replaced with custom open shelving. The adjustable shelves look like they might have been there when the house was built. It enhances the room’s original feel and provides a display for our brown-drip dishware collection.</p>
<h3>Turning closets into a powder room</h3>
<p>There was <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-renovations-that-added-another-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no bathroom on the first floor</a>. We combined two closets—approximately 4’ x 4’—and some square footage where we used to hang coats by the back door. The sacrifice was worth it for what would become the most frequented bathroom in the house. A pocket door with frosted glass saved space and allowed light to flow through. We installed Art Deco wallpaper, wainscoting, a picture rail, and paint in neutral tones.</p>
<p>Though manufacturers say that you can install wood flooring over radiant heat systems, it made me leery, and wood is not an efficient conductor of heat. I was certain I wanted tile, but one that wouldn&#8217;t appear cold or hard.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The right contractor for our Colonial house renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten helped us find a group of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried-and-true general contractors</a> to vet. In the past, we’d tried a few recommended by neighbors, but this time that didn’t work. And this project was too big an investment to just pick somebody out of a hat. It was great to be able to talk through everything with a Sweeten professional and get a curated list. I doubt we&#8217;d have found our contractor on our own, and I&#8217;m so glad we did.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were much more organized than contractors we&#8217;d worked with previously. Our contractor seemed to have experience and know-how beyond his years. When we ran into uncertainties, he was great at suggesting possible solutions. There was a structural issue discovered during demolition that required changes to the design layout. He was quick to help us with potential resolutions, down to providing revised elevations so we could visualize the new design. And he always discussed costs with us before we signed off. They also provided spreadsheets to help me keep track of all the elements I needed to order and have on-site.</span></p>

<h3>Veteran renovators share advice</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with our renovation was waiting for it to be finished! Time moves slowly when you&#8217;re living on the second floor of your home, feeding a family from a makeshift kitchen in your bedroom. This was no fault of our contractors. Our city building department took three months to issue our permits.</p>
<p>If you can, live with your space for a while before renovating. You&#8217;ll end up with a much clearer picture of how to make your new space work best for you.</p>
<p>Also, always budget for 10-20% more than your original estimate, especially for kitchens and baths in old houses. This is our fourth renovation experience, and there has always been a major structural or plumbing issue (or both!) that have come up. It’s never pleasant, but if you plan for it, it&#8217;s way less painful.</p>
<p>Our new space makes us feel happy! We really love all of the new millwork in the home remodel, it feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Amanda and Cory, for sharing your Colonial home remodel story with us!</em></p>

<h3>TLC for a dark, windowless bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="homeowner portrait bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45065" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom tub, fixtures, and drain in this circa 1964 co-op had done their job, but were now way past their sell-by date. Kristen knew her Chelsea apartment was ready for a bathroom renovation. “The shower and tub had gotten a little scary,” said Kristen, the homeowner of this 700-square-foot studio. Peeling paint on the tub and hard water stains on the tiles didn&#8217;t help. Plus, the windowless room was dark, with floor-to-ceiling slate tile and poor lighting. Lastly, there was no medicine cabinet or built-in storage.</p>
<div></div>

<h3>A dark space brightens with white marble porcelain tile</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new plan for the bathroom would be bright and modern with classic elements and storage. Because of building regulations, she wasn’t able to change the location of the plumbing, so the work was cosmetic only. Flash forward to the finished room. The crisp, light walls and tub contrast with the black-and-white floor tile. A white marble porcelain tile shower with lighting reminiscent of Hollywood glamour brighten up the bathroom considerably.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I&#8217;m glad I chose porcelain over marble because it requires less upkeep,” said Kristen. She decided to pass on installing a vanity. Showing more floor gives the illusion of a larger space as does the linear pattern on the floor tile. A free-standing cabinet is part storage and part display. The overall look exhibits how small space bathrooms can carry strong design elements successfully.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“I checked off each item once I had sourced it. This was really helpful because there are some things I never would have thought of, like a new vent for the wall.”

<h3>Organizing material selections</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kristen’s biggest challenge was finding all the materials that would work together. It was difficult, she said, narrowing down selections, “considering the many options out there.” Her Sweeten contractor &#8220;provided a lot of information to help make decisions.” In addition to having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovation Checklist</a>, Kristen had a list of products and materials to order for her project. “I checked off each item once I had sourced it. This was really helpful because there are some things I never would have thought of, like a new vent for the wall,” Kristen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having an organized list also allowed her contractor to make sure it was all compatible with the space. The contractor, she said, “helped incorporate eco-friendly elements into my renovation, telling me what to look for in a toilet, showerhead, and faucet.”</p>
<h3>Inspiration from unexpected places</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her other challenge was that she was traveling during the renovation. But her contractor took care of any bumps, even going directly to the manufacturer when there was an issue with a showerhead. At one point, she said, while she was at the airport waiting for a flight, the Sweeten contractor&#8217;s tile installer called with a layout question. “Luckily, this airport had a lot of tile,” she said with a laugh. “So I walked around and looked for different layouts to help reinforce my decision.” Who needs the internet when airport tile offers loftier inspiration?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A New Jersey basement transforms into a spot for music, lounging, and laundry</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2015, Cristiana and her husband fell in love with a beautiful old house in New Jersey&#8217;s Bergen County. Original details from 1918 had been preserved, and</em> <em>the space was just right for the family of four. While the above-grade spaces were solid and charming, the basement needed some serious TLC. It featured outdated finishes from the 1970s, low ceilings (a big problem for Cristiana’s tall husband!), and a damp, musty feel. </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago, we were moving from a 750-square-foot apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, which felt like it was bursting at the seams. When we purchased our early Craftsman Colonial home, we knew there would be lots of work to do. But it felt solid, had the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and great, livable space. Plus, the original unpainted chestnut moldings and leaded glass built-ins throughout the new house made any renovations that we needed to do seem bearable.</p>

This meant demolishing the &#8217;70s-style finished basement. We weren’t that upset about losing the brown paneling, damp rug, and linoleum-tiled laundry room, and we were saving a lot of money by allowing the electrician free access to the walls and ceiling of the basement. The space had to be refurbished before it could be used for anything besides storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a couple of months of rewiring, patching, and painting, we temporarily relocated the toy storage and our TV to the enclosed front porch and began working with an architect to rethink the space. We came to Sweeten to find a contractor to execute our architect’s vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our plans included moving the laundry room to free up the main living area for toys, creating a craft area, and carving out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine room</a>. An old phone booth left behind by the previous owners was relocated. We hoped to move as many pipes in the labyrinth hanging from the ceiling to provide more headroom for my 6’ 4” husband and our two future six-footers—our sons, currently ages six and eight. New windows were installed and additional waterproofing was added throughout the space.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we got started working with our Sweeten contractor, we tried to determine where waterproofing was necessary and figured out what pipes could be moved and what had to stay. We ran PEX pipes for water in the walls and were able to run all electricity through the ceiling. We had to leave our steam pipes for our original but completely functional heating system because it was cost-prohibitive to move them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor also created easy access points for a (hopefully not so distant) kitchen renovation. In the end, the ceiling in the basement was raised from under six-and-a-half feet to over eight feet tall—a huge improvement and a crucial part of the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the not-so-glamorous phases of waterproofing, plumbing, and electric were completed, we began to see the new rooms take shape. We were surprised by the space that needed to be left between the block walls and the drywall for fireproofing but decided to incorporate built-ins for board games as well as arts-and-crafts supplies. Our contractor also built a custom shelving unit under our TV to help prevent kids from walking into the corner of the TV when it was pulled out from the wall. The area under the stairs turned into a fort for the boys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the walls, we chose a warm gray paired with a soft white trim. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> are COREtec, which looks like walnut but is actually an engineered plank that’s perfect for below-grade spaces. This was one of our contractor’s best recommendations—a floating floor that is easily replaced if it gets wet, feels great underfoot, and looks amazing. We love it, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it!</p>

A wall-mounted drying rack is one of my favorite features. My kids and husband have turned the storage room into a music room, but as long as they don’t mind playing next to our second freezer and extra Cheerios, it works for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s about it for the first phase of our basement renovation. Of course, there are still items on the to-do list. We are planning to turn the wooden phone booth at the bottom of the stairs into a fun space for the boys<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it has working electricity, so we are hoping to wire it with wifi or as a charging station. We will also either paint it red (Londonesque) or blue (Doctor Who!), and add a plaque on the top with our last name. Next to the phone booth is a door that leads to our unfinished wine room, another project for the future.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="couple-with-two-kids-in-entertainment-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48556 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg" alt="Couple with two kids in the entertainment room after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For now, though, we love spending time in our new basement—and getting dedicated storage for the toys, drums, and storage off the main floor! It’s become a great family room for us to hang out in, and for the boys to play with their friends. Working with our Sweeten contractor was an amazing experience. He was cooperative, made great suggestions, and brought the project in on budget.</p>

<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>

<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

<h3>From Manhattan to a tighter-knit neighborhood</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A series of events, including a new job, took Anita from Manhattan’s Chelsea to a co-op in Jackson Heights. “I wanted to live somewhere where I felt part of a community and that my connections could really make a difference. I also left the private sector for the nonprofit world,” she shared. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57122 size-full" title="Sweeten renovator portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her new 850-square-foot apartment in a 1950s building was the right fit for her reimagined life—minus the kitchen. “I knew I’d gut renovate the kitchen the second I saw it,” Anita said. She’d been living simply (with just a bed and kitchen table) in the apartment for three months when she embarked on her first renovation. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he project was posted to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sweeten and was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a selection of vetted <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors in Queens</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h3>A white and wood kitchen for gathering</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita’s mission for the bland and dated space? To create a warm and modern room with plenty of storage and room to host friends. There were no outlets along the entire counter wall either, so updating the electrical panel was essential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57114 size-full" title="white-and-wood-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Two-tone white and wood kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-57115 size-full" title="wood-cabinets-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="kitchen with white walls and natural wood cabinets and floating shelf and stainless steel appliances and floor tiling after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita used Ikea’s kitchen planning tool, working with an Ikea designer to measure the kitchen and select all of the materials she needed to order. Pairing a simple contrast of colors, this combination offered an interesting spin on traditional design for added visual appeal. The dual finishes even carried over into the drawer-within-drawer system for a coordinated look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her years spent living in Germany (where she says everyone renovates kitchens, even in rentals) inspired the appliance choices, as did prior work experience. “I had also worked in refrigeration for vaccines in developing countries and know way too much about refrigerators,” Anita said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking out kitchen floor tile proved to be a more difficult decision. Her contractor recommended a supplier in Queens where, after several trips, she found a cement-look tile made in Italy.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-57124 size-full" title="pull-out-cabinet-drawers-and-floating-shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/26733-Anita-Kithen-02.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>The right contractor is in sync with their client</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-time renovator, Anita worried most about timing, budget, and working with a professional she could trust. Her Sweeten contractor delivered on all three, offering a reasonable estimate based on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>, a clear timeline from the get-go, and following through during the project. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M46pF7SpsME" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My contractor sent me to reputable places priced within my budget that had items in stock. So, I didn&#8217;t have to rely on catalog pictures or internet images. He also respected my budget but knew when to push me toward better quality items or when simpler materials would suffice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of his best traits was being really good at reading people.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractor’s team was also respectful of the building, taking the right precautions and cleaning up every day. Anita said her building super still compliments them on their professionalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she has a brand new kitchen, where she can throw “kitchen parties,” sip wine, and just enjoy the space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Give a generic Jersey City kitchen a modern-industrial twist</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every kitchen in a pencil-factory-turned-apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey, had the same look: brown cabinets, tan tiles, and black countertops. But homeowners Becky and Paul (and their two cats), who’d been living in their two-bedroom apartment almost three years, wanted their cook space to stand out. Their 120-square-foot galley kitchen had a workable layout and thanks to a look-through window, was also connected to the living space. It just needed a refresh of the fixtures and materials, plus more storage. The couple </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30876" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten and were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40861" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first-time renovators got to work with their general contractor to select materials and appliances.  “If we chose something he thought from a professional standpoint wouldn’t work, he would not only explain why but have alternative options for us to review,” they shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were aiming for a bright and airy look with touches of industrial elements to align with their building style, which they achieved with white cabinets, a glossy backsplash, and pops of stainless steel in the faucet and farmhouse sink. The blue wall makes the room appear bigger and lighter, too.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40867 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="653" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-300x196.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-30876-Becky-Kaggen-Kitchen-05-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood-like tile floor (a growing trend in kitchen upgrades), floating wood shelves, and a corner of butcher block countertop add a natural appeal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the kitchen’s coolest new features: a built-in wine rack just above the sink that takes advantage of what would otherwise be empty space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong communication between the contractor and homeowners contributed to the successful completion of the project. If issues cropped up, like delayed deliveries, that would affect timing or cost, the contractor contacted the homeowners right away and found solutions quickly. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a newbie in renovation, this level of communication and education was greatly appreciated. He was also such a champion for us when ordering materials and always put his clients&#8217; needs first when working with vendors,” they shared. The renovators didn’t run into any major issues, though their friendly cats did try to lend a paw throughout the process. On workdays, Becky and Paul set them up in their bedroom to keep them out of the construction zone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten Client Services also just checked in throughout the project to make sure the process was going smoothly. “We could not be more grateful to have such a terrific support system,&#8221; they shared.</span></p>

<h3>Injecting natural light into a Jersey City kitchen</h3>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Improve the layout and look of a drab Jersey City kitchen</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Anne wanted to wait to move into her Jersey City co-op apartment until she renovated the kitchen. After six years of renting, she bought the apartment knowing it would need some work. “I saw 35 finished apartments that just were not ‘me,’ so I was very open to the idea of purchasing a place that needed a little work to make it my own,” she said. Having grown up with a family very comfortable with renovations, Anne was more than ready to take on a project. On her wish list? A kitchen layout optimized for cooking, with plenty of natural light and a mix of traditional and modern details. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/29534">posted her project on Sweeten</a> and after considering her matches chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4260">Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37363 size-full" title="anne-posing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="anne standing in her kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37357 mb-0 size-full" title="two-kitchen-images-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="two images of kitchen with maple cabinets and black countertop with undermount stainless steel sink and white appliances and square tiles on floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anne-Callahan-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: In order to make the best use of the small space, a wall with a cut-out into the living room (and that housed appliances) came down. Knocking it down allowed more light to come into the living room from the window over the sink. Otherwise, the footprint remained the same, with the kitchen sink and dishwasher on one wall, the stove on another.</p>
<p>The builder-grade cabinets were swapped with white shaker cabinets, adding the traditional touch Anne was aiming for. “I picked tall cabinets that went all the way up to the ceiling, and my contractor installed trim at the top to make them look custom,” she said. A classic subway tile backsplash and quartz countertops tied the whole look together. New hardwood flooring in both the kitchen and living area united the space.</p>
<p>A few roadblocks came up during the project, such as outdated electrical and plumbing, but Anne’s contractor handled it all—without delaying the estimated completion time. “The biggest thing that was important for me was to have a timeline that worked. My rental lease was up and I needed a place to live,” she said. Anne was able to move in right on time and start enjoying her new kitchen. Selecting the new cabinets and counters was her favorite part of the process, as was seeing it come together over the weeks of renovation. “It’s extremely rewarding to see how great everything turned out and having your own space that is exactly how you would want it!&#8221;</p>

<h3>A dire kitchen storage situation is resolved</h3>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Add more storage and bring a kitchen up to date</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Kate and Matt loved Jersey City and their home, but were more than ready to refresh their kitchen. Cheap ‘80s-era cabinets were showing their age and the storage situation was dire. The galley set-up also limited their options to expand and create a more cook-friendly space. Kate’s main ask, besides a completely new look, was a breakfast bar. “I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking,” she said, “so I really craved a little spot in which to sit.” <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19777">She posted her project on Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3189">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-kitchen-cabinets-white-countertop"  class="alignnone wp-image-30957 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg" alt="beige kitchen cabinets and white countertop in a kitchen with brown floor before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN_KateStillings_Kitchen-Before02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Luckily, the galley layout proved less of an obstacle than anticipated. She worked with her Sweeten contractor, settling on a built-in breakfast bar at the far end of the kitchen, just above the stairs. The couple worried about the potential for things to fall of the ledge to the floor below, but their contractor&#8217;s recommendation of a raised back on the bar eliminated their concern.</p>
<p>The good fortune continued, as they discovered during demolition the soffits that were taking up valuable wall space were empty. They were removed, and taller upper cabinets installed. To make the galley kitchen feel brighter, the couple chose light materials for the countertops and backsplash to counteract the new gray cabinets.  Their contractor also moved the refrigerator and dishwasher, optimizing the layout for more storage options.</p>

They relocated it to a spot a few feet outside of the kitchen walls. A cutout in the wall at the entrance also helped free up space.

First, using built-in refrigerators and dishwashers–which are only 24 inches deep–creates a seamless, flush line between appliances and cabinets. This eliminates protruding handles or edges. Second, choose your color palette wisely. Light-colored cabinets, like white, gray, and agave, make small spaces look bigger, as do glossy, reflective surfaces. Third, talk to a contractor about adding a pass-through window. These open up the space and allow for guests to mingle while the hosts prepare food. Lastly, look at the overall placement of your cabinets and appliances. Move bulky items, like fridges, away from the kitchen entrance as these can create visual barriers to the space and make it look smaller.</p></div>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333333;"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Sally. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>“After” photos by Pixy Interiors.</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally, a writer, editor, and digital media executive, and Ross, a certified financial planner, bought their two-bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens in a 1946 Art Deco building. Sally had already been through three renovations in other homes. She typically looked for <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spaces in fixer-upper condition</a> (and at an “unrenovated” price) versus buying a recently remodeled home that was not her style. ”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that I can invest in my renovation, get the look and functionality that I want, build equity in my home—and be satisfied with the aesthetic because it’s my design,” she shared.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-40344 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>An inconvenient kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1,100-square-foot home was definitely in need of a renovation. Luckily, it had good bones: hardwood floors, thick plaster walls, and high-coved ceilings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to wait to renovate and see if they should keep the existing galley footprint. It became clear that as a two-cook household, Sally and Ross needed more open space, as they could never fit in the kitchen simultaneously. When the dishwasher was open, it blocked the fridge. Plus, the storage situation wasn’t working. Case in point? To find small appliances in the lower cabinets, Sally had to get on her hands and knees with a flashlight, pulling everything out and back in again.</span></p>
<h3>High marks for contractor communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years of <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">envisioning the kitchen transformation</a>, Sally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sweeten, received <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matches to Queens contracting firms</a>, and interviewed candidates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor she chose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “stood out as the best communicator” and really understood the aesthetic she was looking to achieve. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was able to explain differences in his proposal and showed where his bid foresaw issues the others hadn’t. These were things that were going to come up, and we were going to have to pay for; he was just calling them out ahead of time. I appreciated that,” Sally shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-40350 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen plans took shape</a>, she had two design plans: one with the kitchen totally open to the living area, and, Plan B, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/decisions-galley-kitchen-renovation-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">galley style with a partial wall</a>. During a walkthrough with her contractor and building manager, they discovered water supply, disposal, and gas lines that couldn’t be moved without disrupting service to the building. That meant Plan B, which (spoiler alert!) Sally ended up loving. </span></p>
<h3>The vision without the price tag</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally wanted all-paneled and integrated appliances that felt more like furniture. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found myself gravitating toward kitchens that banked all the tall pantries with the fridges to one side, like Poggenpohl. Henrybuilt has a sleekness I coveted, with its signature absence of wall cabinets and a ubiquitous shelf running along the tops of the slab stone backsplashes. I fell in love with the shaker cabinetry of Plain English, their wonderfully functional sink islands, and use of slab marble,” she said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40343" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew [Sweeten was] there to advise and help me out.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marble backsplash, which Sally referred to as “the star of the show,” consists of two consecutive slabs. A fabricator book-matched them to create the dramatic arc just above the center of the cooktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen design on budget</a>, they designed the kitchen using the IKEA planner tool and sent a PDF of the design to a cabinet manufacturer who outfitted the IKEA cabinet boxes with all custom doors. Opting for stock bases saved the couple $25,000.</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="brass and marble kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45246 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Sally-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall flow improved greatly, thanks to the separate wall ovens and cooktop. Plus, with the refrigerator outside of the main cooking area, it’s easy for guests to grab drinks. The refrigerator is also flanked by tall pantries and cabinets that hold cleaning supplies. Similarly, a narrow unit stores brooms and mops, and all of the base cabinets have deep drawers with organizers. There’s also a unit of freezer drawers, ideal for Sally who batch cooks on the weekends.</span></p>
<h3>Researching contractors with Sweeten</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sally had a strong perspective and sense of what she wanted for her kitchen renovation, and she found a contractor who brought her vision to life. “The number one thing I did right was to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire the right contractor</a>,” she said. Before she chose her contractor, <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> shared advice with her on how to compare contractors, which she used to great effect. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the job, they reached out several times to see how it was going. If I’d had any challenges with my contractor, which I didn’t, I knew they were there to advise and help me out.”</span></p>

<h3>Tips from a veteran renovator</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a four-time renovator, Sally has a lot of advice to share with fellow renovators. “Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou’re going to be making so many choices it will make your head spin. Resist the urge to choose the trendiest or fanciest option at every single decision point. You want one thing, like a marble backsplash, to stand out as the focal point, then maybe a few smaller things, like brass cabinet hardware that picks up the brass in the faucets or in the light fixtures. Let the rest of your choices be the plain backdrop that lets these few gems shine,” she said.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40349" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="broom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-in-all, the renovation finished without a hitch. Sally and Ross love their kitchen. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is extremely gratifying to have a design in your head and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it become a reality</a>. This kitchen is everything that I dreamed it could be. Ross and I cook meals together, clean up together, and everything we need is at our fingertips. And at the reveal party for our floor neighbors, the open kitchen made entertaining so easy and enjoyable.”</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sally and Ross, for sharing your renovation with us!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Turn an awkward space into a functional pantry</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sarah and her husband, Roy, decided after a year of living in their Fort Greene, Brooklyn, home it was time to make some improvements. In addition to updating their office space with all custom built-ins, they wanted to make better use of a cluttered area just outside the kitchen. They’re avid cooks, so more room to store pantry items and dishware was essential. They </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/529" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were matched with a general contractor</a>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sarah-Roy-Berger-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39912 size-full" title="pantry " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sarah-Roy-Berger-Before-01.jpg" alt="pantry " width="775" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sarah-Roy-Berger-Before-01.jpg 775w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sarah-Roy-Berger-Before-01-233x300.jpg 233w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sarah-Roy-Berger-Before-01-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: The once under-utilized niche got a custom upgrade with glass-front shelves, closed base cabinets, and an ornate tile backsplash. A relocated outlet allows the storage area to double as a coffee station, too. It goes to show how projects like these can make a big difference in a home! Sarah and Roy enjoy this new spot every day.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Update mirrored hallway closets<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> When Jonathan and Erin got the opportunity to buy the West Village apartment they were already renting, they jumped on it (with every intention to renovate the space). The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project to Sweeten</a> to remodel the entire home, including </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/modern-makeover-west-village-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and bathroom, and as pictured below, their hallway closets. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-Before-09-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39940 size-full" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="closets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-Before-09-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Jonathan-Oakes-Apt-Before-09-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matching with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the renovation was underway. Even though the closets were a small part of the project, the update to the closet was transformational. New sliding doors reveal a custom system with plenty of space for linens, cleaning supplies, and coats. </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Build a master bedroom closet</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The homeowner wanted to update bathrooms and a master bedroom, both of which had suffered damage from a leak. The bedroom was also in need of a closet since there was no existing, built-in storage space. She </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26173" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted her project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4616" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Elisabeth-Piscareta-Bathroom-Before-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39939 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Elisabeth-Piscareta-Bathroom-Before-08.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Elisabeth-Piscareta-Bathroom-Before-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Elisabeth-Piscareta-Bathroom-Before-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Elisabeth-Piscareta-Bathroom-Before-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Two closets with sliding doors offer invaluable storage. A high bar across both closets creates plenty of hanging space for clothes, while shelves just above are perfect for storing folded clothes or luggage. Plus, a fresh coat of lighter paint completely brightens the entire bedroom.</span></p>
