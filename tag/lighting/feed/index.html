<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How much it costs to renovate your kitchen in Westchester County, NY</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29717 mb-10 size-chrono" title="kitchen renovation cost" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"> (Above) Brooke and Paul&#8217;s Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation</a> in Pelham, New York</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From pendant lighting to LED strips, here&#8217;s a primer on kitchen lighting</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen planning often seems to be concentrated on the “big” stuff—cabinets, appliances, that gorgeous stone countertop you’ve had your heart set on. Lighting is not exactly overlooked, but it typically plays a secondary role to the more expensive and showy features. However, lights are a pivotal part of what makes the elements of a room work, and work beautifully. This is particularly true in the kitchen, where the proper brightness needs to be effective </span><span class="s1"><i>and</i></span> practical, illuminating all the key areas of what is primarily a work environment. It should also bring to life the unique beauty of all the materials and details. A thoughtful mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting will do the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin your plan by re-examining how you use the kitchen and what you do where. Besides cooking and eating, it’s probably a room for socializing as well as office and schoolwork, and crafts or hobbies. Size, too will determine choice as well as placement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ambient lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also referred to as general lighting, this type of illumination serves to light the entire space while creating a welcoming mood. The lighting should be bright but diffused, not focused like task lighting (see below). Overhead recessed lighting is the most common choice to brighten the space and eliminate shadows and glare while creating a warm environment. Dimmers are a must, and will help you control the degree of brightness at any given point during the day or activity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your kitchen is small, a chandelier or group of pendants above the eating area along with an overhead light in the work triangle could do the job for general illumination. However, if your kitchen is very large, with one or more islands, and part of a great room, then recessed lights will also serve to brighten transitional spaces, like a hallway into the kitchen, or the area between the island and clean-up and cooking areas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Task lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential for any area where work takes place, task lighting assures a safe place in which to cut vegetables, wash dishes, or pay bills for that matter. For long runs of countertop, undercabinet lighting such as LED strips are ideal: they are hidden from view and don’t shine in anyone’s eyes, even from a distance, and the light is directed right on the counter. LED strips or ropes also stay cool and last a long time before requiring replacement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an island or breakfast bar, you can install recessed spotlights, or opt for a pendant (or cluster of pendants), to bring warm, focused lighting when you want to switch to a softer atmosphere once the meal is ready. Pendants also allow you style statement opportunities, with plenty of choices for shades and bulbs, and arrangements. Plan to place these and recessed lights on dimmers, too, so you can readily control their intensity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need focused light over the sink; if the basin is placed under a window, opt for a recessed light in the ceiling overhead that you can control with its own switch. This is a good light to leave on solo in the kitchen after dark, as it lights the way to get a glass of water or return a dish from an evening snack.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interior lighting is now available for drawers, too. LEDs, like <a href="https://www.hafele.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Häfele</a>&#8216;s Loox system, illuminate deep corners, so you don’t have to go digging for that errant fork.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task lighting can also be served by a few well-placed lamps, say, a floor lamp in the corner of a dining nook where you might also sit to do paperwork or work on a laptop, or a table lamp in a small desk area, if you want a more furnished look.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Accent lighting</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name indicates, this type of lighting serves to single out features that deserve attention for their decorative qualities; it can also do double duty for task lighting. Most typical options are LED strips at the backs of shelves or cabinets to create a wash of light, highlighting dishware, glasses, or collections or an architectural detail like carved molding. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These strips also make a striking statement under the perimeter of a glass counter or a toe kick (the area between the base cabinet and the floor), to create visual interest and, in the case of the counter, keep someone from bumping into it late at night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An important word about light switch placement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan for light switches at each entry point to the kitchen, to light the way to your destination. Have separate switches installed for each light area—each individual task area as well as the general lighting—to provide the greatest flexibility. Make sure your contractor includes dimmers. You might also want to investigate electronic sensors for automatic control and safety at night.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Their dream space comes to life with herringbone tile, gray kitchen cabinets, and a clawfoot tub</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Editor&#8217;s Note: This post, originally published May 2014, is one of our favorites for still having a classic and modern look years later. Allison and Jovito purchased their first home together—a single-family brick row house, c. 1910, in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn. Though they knew the place needed some serious renovations, Allison, a content manager, and Jovito, an electronic prepress director, both in textbook publishing, promptly packed up and, along with their adorable cat, Momo, moved in and geared up for some major home improvements. Allison shares their renovation story and walks us through the stylish choices she and Jovito made in the process of creating their new home.</i><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24064 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-723x493.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-300x205.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Allison-and-Jovito-600x409.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Guest post by Allison in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten months of intense searching, eight lost bids and a couple hundred viewed properties later, Jovito and I finally found an adorable 1910 brick row house in the Ocean Parkway neighborhood of Brooklyn to call our own. We loved the bones and original details of the house, but the over 100-year-old home was also in need of some serious updating. Knowing that we’d have some large-scale renovations ahead of us, we went into the purchase two parts excited and one part slightly terrified.  There was a long list of items on our “fix” list when we moved in, but we also had a limited budget. So our energy and efforts were focused on tackling the kitchen and upstairs bathroom renovation first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having never renovated a property before, we didn’t know where to start. How would we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a reputable contractor</a> that would understand our vision, work within our budget, and do a stellar job? Perusing Apartment Therapy on a day when I was feeling somewhat overwhelmed by all our options, I read about Sweeten and decided to post <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our project</a> to the site. We really liked the idea that they would act as matchmakers and pair us with contractors based on our project’s scope of work and budget. Knowing that they had pre-screened their network of contractors also made choosing feel a lot less scary.</p>
<p class="alignnone" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11342 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-10.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen bathroom renovation" width="600" height="442" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-10-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24046 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After meeting with two contractor matches from Sweeten, and two contractors that were friend referrals, we decided to award our renovation job to Sweeten. We appreciated his pragmatism, patience in answering our many questions, and his thoroughness during the onsite visit. We also appreciated that he seemed completely un-phased by the scary (to us), timeworn, “before” conditions of the kitchen and bathroom. He’d seen and worked on old houses like this many times, so that also helped us feel like we were in good hands. His familiarity with constructing IKEA kitchens and reasonable estimate sealed the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We started our renovation of the kitchen and bathroom in mid-November. Living in the house during construction wasn’t fun, but our contractor and his team were careful to keep the work area as clean and contained as possible. On the plus side, it was exciting for us to see the team’s daily progress and some of the relics they unearthed during demolition. (Like pieces of newspaper from 1943 mentioning President Roosevelt stuck inside the bathroom walls!) The team spent a lot of time and effort making sure the new walls and floors were level, plumb, and true, which was no small feat in an old house where nothing is straight!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen needed a gut renovation. The walls were covered with dark wood paneling and cabinets, there was a dropped ceiling with fluorescent lighting, cracked floor tile and beat up Formica countertops and backsplash. The existing soffit ran in front of the kitchen window, cutting a good eight inches off the top, and a lot of daylight along with it. It was a less-than-optimal layout and had definitely seen better days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of our limited <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, we decided to go with IKEA kitchen cabinetry and Caesarstone quartz countertops, both of which we purchased during one of IKEA’s kitchen sales. Not wanting the new kitchen to clash with the age of the house but also wanting it to feel current and new, we went with a more traditional cabinet door style in a medium gray color. To keep the space open and airy feeling, we decided to forego wall cabinets. We made sure we had plenty of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet storage</a> to hold all our pots and pans. Because we removed the dropped ceiling, we gained back some ceiling height, so we stacked glass-front cabinets to the ceiling and created a hutch to display our collection of vintage glassware and serveware. We chose durable white quartz countertops to keep the room bright and to add contrast to the gray cabinets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24048 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-723x525.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="525" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24049 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-06-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re tough on our <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, so we chose extra durable wood-look porcelain tile that we found online at a closeout price. Our contractor laid the tile in a herringbone pattern. We really love the way it turned out! For the backsplash tile, we went with a large format porcelain tile with a raised geometric pattern and tiled all the way up the wall for visual impact. (It’s also incredibly <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">easy to clean</a>!) The wall tile is from Mondial in Bensonhurst.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We both love to cook so it was important for us to have a range that could accommodate many pots and pans and put out some serious BTUs. We were incredibly lucky to find our range second-hand in excellent condition at a local salvage shop. The exhaust hood was found in the clearance section of Home Depot and our brand new dishwasher came from the As-Is section of IKEA. Our counter-depth fridge was on sale at the local P.C. Richard &amp; Son.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24051 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24052 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24053 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x483.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="483" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our ceiling light fixtures are porcelain lamp holders made by Leviton running about $2/piece online. The pendant over the sink is from Restoration Hardware and is based off an Italian factory light from the 1950s. We like that the lights can extend out about four feet on each side, giving us the option of creating more overhead <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a> for prep if we need it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to go with brass cabinet pulls, knobs, and faucet to warm up all the cool gray and stainless steel. It took a lot of searching to find a brushed brass faucet, but we finally found one through Newport Brass. The solid brass pulls and knobs are made by Laurey and were also found online.</p>
<p class="alignnone" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11333 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01.jpg" alt="brooklyn kitchen bathroom renovation" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_HomeownerAllison-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24054 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-10-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our bathroom was very…blue. Blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. It had last been majorly renovated in the 50s and everything was really showing its age. The floor of the bathroom was about a 4” step up from the hallway—the ghosts of past flooring renovations buried beneath. To top it all off, the bathroom space itself was tiny—about 36 square feet. Our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> wouldn’t allow us to enlarge the space or reroute plumbing, so our goal was to increase the feeling of space while making it as pretty and useable as possible. Style-wise, we wanted the bathroom to look like it could have been original to the house so we were careful to choose pieces that had an old-fashioned feel to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maximize space, we swapped the existing door for a pocket door and chose a dual-flush toilet with a narrow tank and small footprint. A console sink and clawfoot tub kept things airy and off the floor. Finding reasonably-priced marble floor and subway wall tile at Lowe&#8217;s kept us on budget, as well as sourcing salvage and secondhand materials which helped to cut costs. Finally, we added an exhaust fan/light combo to help cut humidity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24056 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24057 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Allison_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-723x964.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="723" height="964" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite holidays, lots of snow days and a few surprises along the way, the renovation process was mostly stress-free. Our contractor did a good job keeping us informed throughout construction, and he always made himself available to answer questions. And because we lived in our house during construction, we were also able to address and correct any miscommunications right away, which helped the project run more smoothly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re thankful to the Sweeten team for pairing us up with the contractor and his team for an excellent first renovation experience! I&#8217;ve already recommended Sweeten to several friends! Sweeten&#8217;s matching service removes a lot of the scariness and uncertainty associated with finding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualified contractor</a>. And when we’re finally ready to begin the next project, you can be sure we’ll be contacting them for another great match!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we&#8217;re with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ishka Designs</a>.  Anishka &amp; Niya, interior design partners &amp; founders of Ishka Designs, are in the construction phase of a 4,000 sqft medical facility in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.  Working in close collaboration with the client, a medical doctor who offers holistic healing services, the designers will bring this facility well beyond the &#8216;traditional&#8217; by addressing the needs of a holistic design approach. They are utilizing spatial devices such as light, materials, plantings, sensors, etc., to create a clean, ambient environment for the new facility.</p>
