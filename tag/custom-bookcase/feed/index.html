										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re shifting gears from the usual fare of NYC bath and kitchen renovations to look at how one Upper West Sider made custom changes in every room of a two-bed, two-bath co-op to accommodate her incredible collection of art and books. If you&#8217;ve never seen a full-size Terracotta Warrior sculpture in a Manhattan home, today is your day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13050" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-COVER-B-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;I would have been lost &#8211; Sweeten solved the problem of where to begin and the service was amazing. Within two hours of posting my project, I started getting matches. My Sweeten designer was completely on top of everything while I was out of town for four months. I walked out of one apartment in July and into another in October.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>&#8211; Christine, Manhattan homeowner</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first sign that Christine had a very specific vision for her New York home came when she was looking at apartments to buy back in 2008. Her top real estate demand? The new place could be no more than ten blocks from Zabar&#8217;s! After finding a combined unit in a boom-era Rosario Candela building, Christine was thrilled with the gracious and spacious layout (a full dining room in which to serve all of her Zabar&#8217;s selections!) but began to imagine a renovation that would replace the outdated finishes and decade-old paint job. The place was absolutely livable and Christine didn&#8217;t know where to start to find professionals for an upgrade, so years passed before she felt ready to take on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a designer who could help her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create significant storage options and lighting</a> for her extensive library and varied art pieces. Beyond the usual must-haves, Christine also needed someone who could manage the project on her behalf while she spent the summer months in Maine. Most homeowners would be understandably anxious about skipping town while major renovations were underway, but we introduced Christine to this Sweeten designer who signed on to shepherd Christine&#8217;s wish list through to completion and find a home for all of the pieces in the collection.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Christine and her designer set out to solve five major issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.</strong> Fresh paint on everything in sight, stat!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2.</strong> Crown molding and door frames were mismatched and had been thickly painted during past renovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.</strong> The kitchen needed a new floor and backsplash tiles and a to-be-determined facelift for the cabinetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4.</strong> Lighting overhead was no help when Christine wanted to read, cook, and spotlight her favorite works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5.</strong> The apartment&#8217;s storage and display options were no match for Christine&#8217;s collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designer brought in a team to hit each of these to-do&#8217;s and added her own expertise to help Christine find materials that she would love. In the living room, the designer suggested <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=pewter&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Pewter</a> &#8211; Christine loved the neutral selection and ultimately decided to repeat it in other rooms. Custom shelving for the living room and dining room and new crown molding installations unified the rooms and provide a consistent backdrop for the wall to wall book collection. Throughout the design and installation of each new element, the designer kept Christine up to date via regular Skype calls and photo messages, and translated Christine&#8217;s preferences for shelving height, library lighting, and finishes to the crew. When an order snafu resulted in a delivery of picture lighting without a dimming feature, her designer stepped in, made her way all the way to the president of the company that created the lighting, and managed to get a full set of replacements at no extra charge.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13048" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the designer found an ornate cement encaustic tile from <a href="https://www.mosaichse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic House</a> to replace cracked ceramic floor tiles. Christine loves the look and feel of these and immediately took to her designer&#8217;s suggestion for handmade, hexagonal backsplash tiles in various shades of white and gray. The crew debated refreshing the kitchen cabinets with a new coat of paint but ultimately decided to replace them altogether with brand new doors and detailed pulls. Under-cabinet LED lighting helped meet Christine&#8217;s call for more lighting in the kitchen, and crisp molding now provides a beautiful transition from the ground up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13045" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-08.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-08" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-08-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13046" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-09.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-09" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-09-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner Claudia&#8217;s custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in bookshelves</a> in NYC</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Built-ins: Resourceful and good-looking</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll find </span><span class="s2">built-in bookshelves</span><span class="s1"> defined as entire pieces of cabinetry that are extensions of a wall. They are known for being clever space-savers and are a substantial piece of millwork. Typically custom-sized—from floor to ceiling and any width—these </span><span class="s2">built-in cabinets</span><span class="s1"> offer up maximum storage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the expertise of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors from NYC, we break down the elements that go into the cost for custom built-in bookshelves: materials, labor, and site conditions. Have a better understanding of what goes into the process of creating millwork, and how it factors into <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your renovation budget</a> as a whole.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Average costs on built-in bookshelves </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a basic internet search brings up a lot of information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation costs</a>, rates for built-in cabinets are harder to find. </span><span class="s1">This is due in part to the uniqueness of these projects—no two are the same! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That said, many millworkers rely on a linear footage model as a basis for calculating pricing, with various factors affecting overall cost. In urban areas like New York City, the range starts between $800 to $1,000 per linear foot for basic open shelving.</span></p>
<h4>Why are custom bookshelves so expensive?</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The number one misconception is the expected cost. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experienced GCs will guide you</a> on the several important factors that will attribute to creating your custom built-in bookshelves, according to NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractors Nina and Ilya</a>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Materials – “Lumber is expensive,” said Nina. “It may not look like it but there’s a lot of wood involved in turning the raw material into the finished product.” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Labor – This cost includes “preplanning, labor, studio, and shop work to prefabricate the product,” they said. “It then gets delivered to the site for installation.”</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Site condition – The existing condition of the space will determine if additional time and attention is required in designing or installing the project. Are the walls bowed or the floors uneven? Are there finishes that need to be matched to existing furniture or flooring? Other site variations can affect the price. Read more about site conditions below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Custom built-ins result in a one-of-a-kind piece made to your exact specifications that fit precisely into your space. The work that goes into a custom built-in piece often extends beyond what homeowners can imagine: Skilled experts source the materials, design, build, and perfect the unit before transporting it from the workshop to your home.</p>
<p>In the end, you are paying for both service and craftsmanship, elements that are usually missing from an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; experience.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A note on material delays</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractors note that markets have been experiencing a </span><span class="s2">backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. </span><span class="s1">“We’ve been experiencing some shortages in wood, lacquer, and paint,” said Ilya.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For NYC homeowners interested in renovating, consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">finding a licensed general contractor</span></a>, scheduling, and signing them to lock in material prices. Your contractor will be able to get your material orders in the queue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They suggest building the delays into your timeline. “It’s taking 12–16 weeks for cabinets and built-ins from start to install,” said Ilya. “Stock cabinets deliver the fastest,” he said. “The more customized the design, the more it will add to the delivery time.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom bookshelves: Materials, installation, other features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get an accurate estimate, you’ll need to take a few other variables into account. For example, the average range of</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">$800 to $1,000 per linear foot usually assumes that the unit will be no taller than eight feet.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Excess height will translate into higher costs. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are other factors that can impact the budget of built-ins:</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Materials for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multitude of options includes solid woods, plywood, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), veneers, high-pressure laminate, and melamine. The good news is you’ll definitely find a style to suit your style and needs. Some points to think about:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid wood</b> is the gold standard because it is both classic and timeless. While solid wood is usually strong and sturdy, some types may crack, buckle, or shrink when subject to heat and humidity.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>MDF</b> is a good option when you’re on a budget or if you plan on painting the shelves. It is composed of dried, pressed recycled wood fibers and resin. It withstands temperature changes better than many kinds of wood. It also acts as an excellent substrate for veneers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Plywood</b> is an engineered wood like MDF but essentially made of pressed sheets of wood veneer, which is why layers are visible along the edges. Higher grades of plywood are used for cabinets and shelving, while lower grades are what you might see in housing construction and subfloors. As with solid woods, you can choose different types of plywood such as maple, pine, or birch.</span></li>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finishes for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">After choosing the materials, decide how you’d like your shelves finished. Options to consider:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Paint</b> is the go-to option. With this route, there may be a price difference based on the method of application (brush, roller, or spray), and the quality and brand of the paint you choose.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid</b> <b>lacquer </b>is a popular choice, which provides hard, glossy finishes that range in the level of sheen from clear to colored. Lacquer produces an extremely damage-resistant finish. It’s ideal for projects that see a lot of traffic, such as low shelving in a child’s room.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Varnish</b> is usually transparent but also comes in a range of glossy to satin finishes. Like lacquer, it produces a durable finish.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Unfinished</b> shelving creates a more industrial contemporary look.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">A lot of labor goes into producing a high-quality painted finish. (For a case study, read about the time and labor spent on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/"><span class="s3">Kate and Arthur’s DIY cabinets</span></a>.) The entire process can take up to five days and include up to four coats of primer and finish. Compared to two to three coats of a high-quality clear lacquer that can be applied in as little as one day. The additional labor costs easily offset the savings of less expensive, “paint-grade” materials.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Site conditions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The type of building structure you live in—house, apartment, walk-up, or elevator—contributes to pricing differentials when it comes to built-ins. Projects in apartments often take longer to deliver and install than those in houses. “Labor costs increase when materials need to be maneuvered in a walk-up building,” Ilya said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In addition to the logistics of parking and unloading on a busy city street, some apartment buildings have strict work hours for contractors. This can limit the amount of work that they can finish in one day, stretching a one-day installation into two.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features and components of custom bookshelves</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Simple open shelving is the least expensive built-in option. Most experts don’t calculate costs per additional drawer or door. However, the more features you include, the higher the overall cost. Glass doors or shelves, a floating desk, and lighting all add cost in time and materials.</span></p>
<p>Custom built-ins may conjure up visions of grand homes but, in fact, are great space-savers in smaller homes. These cabinets are the touch of millwork to up your storage game in any room. <span class="s4">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span class="s5">renovate with the best contractors in NYC</span></a>.</span></p>
