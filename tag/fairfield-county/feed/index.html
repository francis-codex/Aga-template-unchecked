<p>Creating a budget for a renovation is unique to every project; the many variables, from your own taste for materials and quality of work to whether you are changing the layout or are moving plumbing or gas lines in a kitchen or bathroom, all factor into the equation.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has compiled a general guide to renovation costs in Fairfield County focusing on four categories—kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: <strong>$150—$350</strong> per square foot (psf)</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$335 </strong>psf or <strong>$67,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$630 </strong>psf or <strong>$133,000</strong></li>
<li>Budget bathroom remodel: <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom remodel: <strong>$600 psf</strong> or <strong>$21,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: <strong>$665 psf</strong> or <strong>$66,500</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$117 psf</strong> or <strong>$75,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</p>

<h2>What a Connecticut home remodel cost per square foot</h2>
<p>The general range for a gut renovation in Fairfield County, CT is <strong>$150</strong> to <strong>$250 psf</strong>, according to Elizabeth, an architect in the Sweeten network. That price can easily sneak up to <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$350</strong> a square foot, she advised, depending on how complex your renovation is (structural issues, layout changes, etc.) and how expensive your tastes are in terms of fixtures and finishes. Those figures also do not include fees for architects and engineers who might be necessary throughout the course of the project.</p>
<p>Residential renovation costs have increased on average <a href="https://edzarenski.com/2018/11/16/2019-construction-economic-forecast-dec-2018e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.7% each year</a> between 2013 and 2018. For most contractors, cost increases or decreases in all areas—labor, materials, etc—can fluctuate year to year and even throughout the year. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Oziel</a>, who works in Westchester as well as Fairfield, also pointed out that finishes—tiles, flooring, countertops, lighting, appliances, faucets, etc.—go up each year, as do overhead costs for workers compensation and general liability insurance.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry, a Sweeten contractor</a> in Fairfield County, said he tries to absorb the increases in insurance costs. He also said that while construction items go up every year, most of the increase goes to framing and electrical materials. Sweeten architect Elizabeth noted that a shrinking construction labor force in wealthy areas raises the price for skilled plumbers, electricians, and framers.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut kitchen renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.  <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has done a budget kitchen for <strong>$40,000</strong> that was 150 square feet. This budget includes semi-custom cabinets and granite or quartz countertops with no changes to the layout.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: A typical mid-grade kitchen renovation in Fairfield County is priced at <strong>$335 psf</strong>, or <strong>$67,000</strong> according to the Cost vs. Value report. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with laminate countertops, a standard sink, and faucet, with an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes a garbage disposal, custom lighting and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork. New kitchens that Elizabeth’s architectural firm has worked on usually cost between<strong> $25,000</strong> to <strong>$60,000</strong>, but it is easy to surpass that, she said.</li>
<li>High-end kitchen: For a kitchen renovation, this could mean fully custom cabinets, sourcing the best materials from overseas, and dealing with the added expense of a layout change, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfonso, a Sweeten contractor</a>. A recent kitchen renovation he worked on came to <strong>$125,000</strong>. The cabinets alone were <strong>$70,000</strong>, the countertop material was shipped in from Italy, and changing the layout of the kitchen also bumped up the cost and involved substantial plumbing and electrical work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example Alfonso used came in a little under the Cost vs Value report’s average price of a high-end kitchen of <strong>$133,000</strong> or <strong>$630 psf</strong>. This includes more expensive materials such as stone countertops, an imported tile backsplash, a water filtration system, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, plus a built-in microwave unit.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut bathroom renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathroom remodels can start at<strong> $15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. Majid has worked on projects costing <strong>$15,000</strong> for a minimum space measuring 5’ x 8’ that includes labor and rough materials. A budget of <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> is typical for a full bathroom renovation in the Fairfield area, according to Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Fairfield County, Connecticut will cost on average <strong>$21,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report which equates to <strong>$600 psf</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity country, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: That same report put a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at<strong> $66,500</strong>. The sample bathroom was expanded from 35 square feet to 100. It amounted to <strong>$665 psf</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the more expensive bathrooms Alfonso worked on came in at <strong>$88,000</strong>. This included a walk-in closet that led into the bathroom. The client wanted a custom-made European toilet, major structural changes, and marble shipped from Italy, which had a lead time of three months for delivery.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut basement renovation</h2>
<p>Basement renovations by Sweeten contractors have ranged from <strong>$30,000</strong> to<strong> $100,000</strong>. An average basement conversion across the county is <strong>$75,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report. The project for this size budget includes a 20′ x 30′ room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower and a bar area as well as insulation and laminate flooring, which comes to <strong>$117 psf</strong>.</p>
<p>The elements that tend to inflate the budget include adding a toilet or a shower and work needed to bring the room up to code. Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (so adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor.</p>
<h2>Costs for permits</h2>
<p>Each town in Fairfield County has its own table of fees for building permits. Building permits, including those for plumbing and electrical, can cost anywhere from <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$2,500</strong> per project. The variation is often tied to your budget. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Stamford, your building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each $1,000 in your budget. That permit will cover your electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work.</li>
<li>In Westport, the permit fee for demolition is <strong>$2</strong> per 100 cubic feet of volume while the building fee is <strong>$10</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> of the renovation budget.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.greenwichct.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8484/FEES-2018-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenwich</a>, a building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> in your budget. The electrical permit fee is <strong>$12</strong> per <strong>$1,00</strong>0 of the cost of the project; this fee is the same for a plumbing permit fees.</li>
<li>Over in <a href="https://www.norwalkct.org/128/Fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwalk</a>, building fees are structured slightly different. A building permit costs <strong>$13</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of estimated work, which includes some electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work. However, if there are major changes in these areas, then separate permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC might be required at a cost of <strong>$13.26</strong> for every<strong> $1,000</strong> budgeted in those areas. Check the building department in your local township for a better idea of permitting costs for your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues you may or may not encounter along the way such as structural problems that need fixing or bringing a staircase up to current code could also manipulate your end budget. Take into consideration wet areas like kitchens or bathrooms cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex, Alfonso says.</p>
<p>Hopefully, all of these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget. Sweeten’s Renovation Checklist offers you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a downloadable roadmap to organize</a> all of the moving parts of a renovation including laying out your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Connecticut couple refreshes their first townhouse</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2016, Brooklyn homeowner Lauren embarked on her first Sweeten renovation. The result: a beautiful <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alcove studio</a> that was featured in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times story</a> on organizing small spaces. In 2017, she moved to Connecticut to join her fiancé and upgraded to a 3,000-square-foot condo in Stamford. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Space was no longer an issue, but the home appeared to be stuck in the early ‘80s. There was also a suspiciously damp smell from the accumulation of several leaks during the previous owners&#8217; time there. Given her positive past experience with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, Lauren returned to post her latest project to find the best contracting team. (Luckily, Sweeten had recently expanded its free service, matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, to Fairfield County.) Read on for her take on renovating with Sweeten outside of New York City!</em></p>

Guest post by Stamford homeowner Lauren</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is now my second Sweeten renovation and my first time renovating with my fiancé, Austin. After remodeling my Brooklyn Heights co-op, I ended up moving to Stamford, Connecticut, the following year and started looking for a condo to buy with Austin. The search didn’t take long and we found a 3-bed, 2.5-bath townhouse that was in need of some updating before we moved in. The unit had lots of potential, but it was dated and hadn’t really been touched since it was first built over 30 years ago: orange oak kitchen cabinets, vinyl flooring, wall-to-wall carpeting, mirrored walls—you get the idea.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we had a vision for the space, and given how smoothly my first renovation experience had gone, it was only natural that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25822#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we turned to Sweeten</a> again to help us find our contractor. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor we chose</a> was incredibly organized, professional, and had a very detailed quote, which we appreciated. Some contractors struck us as too hopeful with regard to project scope, while others were “doom-and-gloom” purveyors, finding calamity behind every piece of drywall. Our contractor tempered our enthusiasm by identifying challenges we didn’t see coming but never told us something couldn’t be done. He was attentive and imaginative.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I was leaving my recently renovated apartment to start our life together in Stamford, we needed to bring some of the modern city elements to the suburbs. One of the challenges was the large amount of space to be updated without having a huge budget. Since we had plans to grow into the space over time, we decided to focus on the areas we’d use the most—the first two floors and the master bathroom. We wanted the unit to feel current with our own choices but without ripping everything out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I worked really well together and collaborated on elements that were important to us. He pushed for the recessed lighting in the kitchen and dining room, whereas I was excited about the engineered floor and spent weeks reviewing my selection. Believe it or not, I found the flooring company on a deep-dive on Instagram. There were no local distributors or showrooms, but I was able to track down a salesperson in Texas who helped me select the material remotely. When it arrived, I knew it was the best decision; it really transformed the space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, we knew the wall-to-wall carpet on the first two floors would be replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered hardwood</a>. The kitchen cabinets would be repainted and new appliances added. We increased the kitchen storage and functionality by adding the Simple Human under-sink trash and recycling bins. Roll-out chrome baskets held strainers and cleaning supplies and pot lids sat on racks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding a bill-paying station/drop zone just outside the kitchen made a big difference. It used to be an extra kitchen cabinet. But in order to make the space work for us, I knew we needed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work area</a> that wasn’t the dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we added California Closets to maximize the space. The closets had an odd layout, so a custom system enabled us to design it to fit our needs. The master bath was refreshed with new tile and fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An entryway on the lower level from the garage leads you to our gym. Our Sweeten contractor worked incredibly hard on these stairs after the carpeting was removed. He showed his skills laying down the plank, nosing, and risers, especially with the corners and angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A home gym/multipurpose room was created on the lower level. Our contractor covered the concrete floor with a specific floor paint as a moisture barrier and then laid down interlocking foam floor tiles. They were more cost-effective and functional than continuing the engineered wood into this space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every renovation has its ups and downs. In this one, we kept discovering water damage! When we bought the condo, it had a musty smell, so we knew we were going to find some sort of water issue, but I don’t think we realized how much. The previous owners just covered up rotten subfloor with new carpeting in multiple places. And when they decided the lower level needed a closet, they just framed it out right on top of the shag! So it proved comical when we tried to remove the old carpet and found ourselves using pliers to get every last bit of remnant out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor and his team worked late into the evenings and on many weekends to keep up with our scheduled move-in date. Unfortunately, our flooring got delayed, and that held him up, but he was proactive and able to work on other projects in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, we learned it will always take longer than you had hoped, but in the end, it’s all worth it. Make all of your design selections in advance of starting construction. You can cut down on costs by taking on some of the work yourself, but there’s a reason why professional contractors stay in business. They quickly finished what would have been gargantuan tasks to amateurs like us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I love our new space. Friends and family come over and are so impressed with the transformation. My second Sweeten renovation went as well as my first, and I think it speaks to the company and the quality contractors that are in the Sweeten network.</p>
<p><em>Lauren and Austin, thanks for showing us your updated townhouse—and for being repeat customers! We love &#8220;serial renovators&#8221;!</em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Gut renovate a bathroom in a 117-year-old house in Connecticut</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 2016, Joel and Nina, along with daughter Bailey, and their cats, Cookie and Coco, bought a stunning Victorian home in Cos Cob, Fairfield County, Connecticut. They had been living in the area for some time and wanted a quieter street and a house with more space. The 2,700-square-foot home, complete with a two-and-a-half-car garage and stained glass windows in the foyer, won them over pretty quickly. However, their first winter in the home made them realize something was seriously problematic with the bathroom that they couldn’t see. “The room was an icebox, so we knew something was wrong,” said Joel. “We just didn’t know the extent.” Besides the temperature issues, the bathroom had a &#8217;70s vibe and needed updating. It was also small—seven by eight feet—and the couple saw a better way to utilize that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Nina were novices</a> with this type of project, so they turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs homeowners with fully vetted general contractors, to find <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> and help them navigate the process. The unknown source of the cold turned out to be a huge hole in the outer wall, not to mention almost non-existent installation. “The whole room, more or less, had to be rebuilt,” said Joel. New spray foam and fiberglass insulation were installed as needed. To better organize the space, the family had an 18-inch-deep vanity custom made, which was shallower than the previous one. They also moved the entry door slightly for better access. The project took four months instead of the original five-week <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>, mostly due to the room being in worse shape than had been expected. Also, custom shelving that Joel ordered took a long time to arrive. One piece of advice the couple has is to avoid delays by having all the materials on the job site ready to go. “We didn’t, which is one of the reasons the project took so long,” he explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The original linen closet had the issue of being too deep, rendering its far corners almost unusable. Joel and Nina’s Sweeten contractor installed moveable shelves that slide in and out of the closet so they could maximize every inch of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>.</p>
