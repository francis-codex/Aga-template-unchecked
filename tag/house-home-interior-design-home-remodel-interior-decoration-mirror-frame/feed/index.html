										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An apartment I&#8217;m remodeling has large mirror panels on one of the living room walls.  The mirrors cover the entire surface of the 12-foot-wide wall and are trimmed with a narrow aluminum angle.</p>
<p>These mirrors do a fantastic job of bouncing light around \ and enlarging the sense of space, but they have an early 70&#8217;s feeling that might not feel right with the reduced, modern feeling of the finished apartment, which will have dark oak floors and white walls.  I&#8217;d like to replace these panels with one or more large framed mirrors.</p>
<p>We could use mirrors with a minimal frame, like these <a title="West Elm Floor Mirrors" href="https://www.westelm.com/products/w538/?pkey=cmirrors" target="_blank">floor mirrors</a> from West Elm.  But we&#8217;d definitely want to hang them on the wall horizontally.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it  would be nice to use an antique mirror for contrast.  This<br />
<a title="Ruby Lane, London" href="https://www.rubylane.com/" target="_blank">squarish white mirror</a> has a nice heft to it, although it feels a bit shabby.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4734913603_35cd1ea63b.jpg" alt="RUBYLANE ANTIQUE MIRROR" /></p>
<p>I love this <a title="Trouver Antiques" href="https://www.trouverantiques.co.uk/inventory/index.php?c=7" target="_blank">door-shaped mirror</a> with a plaster frame at Trouver Antiques.  It would look pretty on the wall, and also slightly mysterious.  Is there a door behind there, and what does it lead to?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4734913359_4ccf02d1b9.jpg" alt="ANTIQUE PLASTER MIRROR" /></p>
<p>This <a title="Restoration Hardware" href="https://rh.com/rh/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1060091&amp;navCount=3" target="_blank">beaded Venetian-style mirror</a> from Restoration Hardware has clean lines and proportions, but I wonder if it&#8217;s wide enough to make an impact on the large wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4735551366_64827f13e7.jpg" alt="RESTORATION HARDAWARE VENETIAN MIRROR" /></p>
<p>How about a shaped mirror? I like the restraint and geometry of this <a title="Restoration Hardware" href="https://restorationhardware.com/" target="_blank">oval mirror</a> from Restoration Hardware.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4735551804_c6109e4ba5.jpg" alt="RESTORATION HARDWARE OVAL MIRROR" /></p>
<p>And I like the deep wood frame at this <a title="West Elm" href="https://www.westelm.com/products/w556/?pkey=cmirrors" target="_blank">round, modern mirror</a> from West Elm.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4735650708_465790b885.jpg" alt="WEST ELM ROUND MIRROR" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still worried that all of these mirrors are too small and will be swallowed by that huge wall. The best approach might be to determine how large the mirror needs to be first.  Then we could ask the carpenters to fabricate a wood-framed mirror similar to this <a title="Ikea Molger" href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10154596" target="_blank">Ikea mirror</a>, with similar proportions and a simple profile.</p>
