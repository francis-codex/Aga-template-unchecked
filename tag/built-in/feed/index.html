										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>

<h3>Renovation plan: living in the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To say I won the real estate lottery might feel like an overstatement, but after a short hunt, I found a Brooklyn Heights co-op in a 1920s building. It had everything I had been looking for—two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting in new hardwood floors</a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question—and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn’t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn’t exactly scream a clear solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31285 size-feature" title="happy-homeowner-renovated-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait-936x667.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in a renovated kitchen" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, “brilliant” plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an island, then a peninsula</a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn’t) working for the kitchen.</p>

<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the “entry,” but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a drop ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.</p>

<h3>Two prep zones</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and keep it close to the cooktop/oven. By doing this, I <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created two zones for prep</a> on each side of the sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop/oven, and the refrigerator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.</p>

<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the way my apartment “boundaries” were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design, there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and “open” storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a “piano” finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I’m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.</p>

<h3>Consider all possibilities</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I optimistically planned for a “quick” two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor’s work.</p>
<h3>Brighter and more functional home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating my own space as an architect</a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I’m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,  and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they’re coming for dinner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Warning: gorgeous storage inspo ahead</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though they’re a bigger commitment than your standard bookshelves, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-ins</a> offer not only a storage solution for your home, but also lend character to a study or living room. Just keep in mind that not all built-ins are the same—some are quite literally built into an alcove or encased in a wall, while others resemble a more standard piece of furniture, typically drilled into a wall. From floor-to-ceiling shelves to built-ins under glass, here are seven ideas to inspire your organization goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Seven serene retreats with tucked-in storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the rest of your home, your bedroom is a place to surround yourself with the things you love. It&#8217;s also a place for more personal trinkets and mementos, which means storage for those (and, of course, all your clothes) is key. By incorporating custom built-ins, floating shelves, and even a hidden closet, these Sweeten homeowners&#8217; private spaces are certain to inspire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22583 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22583 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, serene, storage, neutral" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-22585 noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22585 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Whitney_Bedroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="bedroom renovation, closet, serene, storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/interior-designer-rearranges-order-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whitney and Laurence&#8217;s</a> apartment was a huge plus—the awkward closet layout was anything but. Their contractor knocked down the four separate closets and created one dressing room to accommodate both of their wardrobes. Careful planning left ample room for two large dressers, plus a king-size bed.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in this <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowner&#8217;s</a> apartment boasted stunning natural light thanks to its west-facing windows—it just needed some minor storage reconfiguration to bring it up to snuff. To take advantage of the high ceilings, the contractor built open shelving across the length of the room. The original closet was moved between the bedroom and bathroom, and reimagined as a walk-in dressing room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/">Claudia</a> set out to redesign her bedroom, a window seat was at the top of her list, along with the need for more storage. In order to meet both demands, a multi-functional built-in was designed around the casement to house books and keepsakes. Staying true to her vision, a custom seat was added and topped with an upholstered cushion to create a cozy spot for curling up with a good book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22191 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with double closets" width="723" height="482" /><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-20415"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-20415 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SWEETEN_Hari_Apartment-16-2-723x1085.jpg" alt="sweeten_hari_apartment-16" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hari-kaitys-living-room-closet-renovation-brooklyn-heights/">Hari and Kaity&#8217;s</a> apartment had limited closet space and lots of square footage left over for furniture. To address growing storage concerns, the couple decided to use the far wall of the bedroom to build out a pair of full-size closets filled with custom shelving and storage. Now that they have plenty of room to store clothing and more, the original closet was transformed into an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22188" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_MarioApt-06-723x517.jpg" alt="Modern bedroom with floating shelves" width="723" height="517" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a redesign of their apartment knocked down most of the walls in favor of an open-plan arrangement, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/">Mario and Joe</a> realized they needed more wall space to display their growing treasures from travels around the globe. Stacked floating shelves in their bedroom became the perfect solution to showcase their collection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22189" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-11-723x482.jpg" alt="Bedroom with built-in for books" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a large assembly of books and a serious lack of storage space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/">Christine</a> turned to the nearly blank canvas of her bedroom for a thoughtful solution. The wall behind her bed was transformed into a library with a custom built-in that reaches from floor to ceiling, while a pewter paint finish softens the predominantly white space. Key elements for a personal library include wall sconces that are essential for reading in bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22190 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="White bedroom with dressing room attached" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">By preserving the wall between the bedroom and newly created walk-in dressing room, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/">Jerry and Janet</a> were able to move the closet out of sight while keeping it easily accessible. Positioning the bed in the middle of the room with the dressing area behind the headboard adds an interesting architectural element to the space. The streamlined design also complements the original 1910 window moldings that were painted black for a touch of contrast.</p>

<p>As a longtime renter on the Upper West Side, Melissa was intent on staying in the neighborhood when she began her search for a home to buy. She spent several years, on and off, going to open houses and scrolling through endless listings. When she came across this apartment in a prewar co-op building on West End Avenue, with beautiful light from a southern exposure and the right amount of space, she knew it was the one. It was a one-bed, one-bath and measured about 500 square feet. More happy changes were in store for Melissa, however. Between the time that her offer was accepted and the final approval from the board, her boyfriend proposed! They now had to ensure that the apartment could accommodate both of them and their belongings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33421" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-Before-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-Before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33420" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-After-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Floorplan-After" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33422 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset-Before-02" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33423 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset04-723x482.jpg" alt="built-in storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the challenge of creating a functional layout and enough storage for two people, Melissa <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a> to find an architect who would help them “use every inch of space in the best possible way.” They chose to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> with architectural services to transform the space. Originally, the apartment had what was likely the world’s smallest kitchen—so tiny it could have easily fit into a coat closet. Its appliances were typical of those found in dorm rooms: a mini-fridge, a compact range, and an unsightly microwave mounted to the underside of one of two sets of upper cabinets. The bathroom was also too small, with a sink that you could barely wash your hands in and no space to turn around. To top it off, the apartment had just one closet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-wooden-custom-cabinets" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33426 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset10.gif" alt="brown wooden custom cabinets with open and closed shelves after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="wooden-veneer-custom-cabinets" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33425" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset09.gif" alt="wooden veneer custom cabinets on light brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having identified the problems that they needed to solve, Melissa worked with her architect and contractor (whom she hired separately) to achieve her goals: a kitchen that could hold full-sized appliances, plenty of closet space, as well as a larger bathroom. Fortunately, there was space to be taken from the large bedroom to create a more spacious bathroom. Her Sweeten architect also designed a full wall of storage space, faced with simple oak slab fronts in each the kitchen and the bedroom. By establishing aesthetic continuity throughout the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a> and the storage wall, the architect was able to make all the additions Melissa and her fiancé needed without making the apartment feel cramped.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33428 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset08-723x482.jpg" alt="built-in storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" title="wood-veneer-custom-cabinets-kitchen" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset05.gif" alt="wood veneer custom cabinets in kitchen and bedroom after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
(Above) Looking from the kitchen toward the bedroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the far corner of the living room, the storage wall included open shelving as well as hidden storage for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar and a wine fridge</a> underneath. As the wall progressed into the kitchen area, the wall accommodated a counter-depth refrigerator directly across from the sink and stove area to create a kitchen nook.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="custom-cabinetry-wood-veneer" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset07.gif" alt="custom cabinetry in wood veneer with long nickel handles after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="natural-wood-veneer-custom-cabinets" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset11.gif" alt="natural wood veneer custom cabinets for a walk in closet in bedroom after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="wood-veneer-cabinetry-small-compartments" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33432 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset16.gif" alt="wood veneer cabinetry and small compartments for light swiches after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
(From top) Hampers across from bathroom; closet in the bedroom; light switches in the bedroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the wall continued past the kitchen, the cabinetry directly across from the bathroom door opened to reveal built-in hampers. Immediately beyond a blackened-oak pocket door was the bedroom. The storage wall continued here, concealing various more drawers as well as a full walk-in closet that was customized to the homeowners’ needs. Some utilitarian details got swept up in the design. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have space to move the switches, so we left them as is and then just added the small compartment,&#8221; Melissa said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33433 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN MelissaMideaker KitchenBathCloset18" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" title="porcelain-tile-kitchen-brushed-nickel-fittings" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33434" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset23.gif" alt="Porcelain tile kitchen with brushed nickel faucet and white vessel sink along with wood veneer custom cabinet after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aesthetic carried through to the now-enlarged bathroom, which incorporated a larger shower area and yet more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>—artfully tucked between an immovable beam and the far wall of the shower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, Melissa shares that the biggest challenge was the time it took to get approvals from the DOB (Dept. of Buildings). On the final design, Melissa tells us, “All the materials were chosen with the idea of making the space feel larger, which seems to be driven by a more modern look. However, my fiancé and I are more traditional, so our architect looked for transitional pieces. The woodwork has modern lines, but the hanging light fixtures in the kitchen are more traditional. We were looking for a unique backsplash in the kitchen and ended up picking something that&#8217;s reminiscent of a tin roof in many original NYC ceilings. I love the feeling of a spa, so we chose bathroom tiles that appeared like stones.” Mixing styles to bring function and design together has helped make the couple&#8217;s apartment exactly what they needed.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Melissa! We hope you love the new home with your fiancé. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

Here, she is able to store extra towels and other toiletries.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="Recessed cabinet in bathroom for extra storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Ross</a>, their bathroom was in need of a major overhaul. They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>

The blue-stained ash wood matches the sink vanity.</p>

They upgraded it with double mirrors, featuring storage ledges for a more modern storage interpretation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Take notes from these Sweeten renovators, who expertly renovated their homes to get studio apartment storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a studio apartment, closet and storage space is scarce. Your only options for keeping everything in your home are being surrounded by your stuff 24/7 or adopting a minimalist lifestyle and ditching most of your belongings. Neither are perfect solutions. Instead, reimagine the closet, not as a single space where you keep everything, but as multiple spaces throughout your home. Take inspiration from five resourceful renovators who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—and see where things can go in a small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom built-in" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>A low cabinet wall can replace closet space for studios</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A low wall of cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew&#8217;s bedroom</a> is the perfect storage alternative to the missing closet, providing ample clothing and shoe storage. Aligning the top of the built-in with the lower half of the window not only keeps it from making the room feel smaller but—<em>voilà!</em>—he now has a window seat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen cabinetry on a blank wall creates a pseudo pantry &amp; fridge space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Square footage was limited in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren’s tiny kitchen</a>, so she took a blank wall and loaded it up with storage for a hidden pantry and fridge—plus, a coat closet! Tucking everything out of sight provides an uncluttered and sophisticated look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30499 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30500 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom wall-hung cabinetry instead of a closet? Yes, please!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of closets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Ian’s studio</a> meant that they had to get creative when it came to clothing storage. A custom walnut cabinet in the bedroom area with a mahogany finish takes advantage of empty wall space and adds some visual interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30000 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30002 size-chrono" title="studio built-ins" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Sleek storage in the living area expertly blends in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ying’s studio</a>, she took the average closet build and turned it inside out, adding cabinet storage, shelving, and drawers along the perimeter of the main living area.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26644 size-chrono" title="custom sliding wardrobe" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A sliding door that doubles as cleverly hidden clothing storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel’s bedroom</a> had a new entryway, but no closet space whatsoever, so he designed a custom sliding door that doubled as wardrobe storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Ron’s postwar apartment</a> and home of 40 years</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Map out your bathroom storage strategy, using a vanity, shelves, custom built-ins and secret niches</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Melina and Fabio&#8217;s gold and marble</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating shelves</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Medicine cabinets</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19471 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span style="color: #76808f;">Maria and Eric&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in niche</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Match an entire apartment to a previous renovation and build dream shoe storage in Hell’s Kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Matthew, the managing director of a fashion advertising agency, bought his apartment in 2012, only half of it had gone through a renovation. A few elements, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and floors, were in the present. Everything else stood sadly in the past. The old radiators stuck out like sore thumbs. So did the sliding doors of the storage closets. Then Matthew had the sartorial problem of 87 pairs of shoes stacked up against a wall in the one-bedroom co-op.  “I really wanted to bring the entire apartment up to a modern, minimalist, clutter-free design,” said Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Much of the design was done from scratch, so Matthew <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4676#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and worked with his design/build <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. “We literally went through twenty design options for the shoe closet alone,” Matthew said. But the outcome was worth it. The shoe storage is designed to Matthew’s shoe size, which is a nine. There is room for 90 pairs, including his favorites, Common Projects Blush sneakers and black Gucci loafers. The radiator in the living space is hidden under a desk where Matthew can sit for breakfast by the window. In the bedroom, a dressing bench, flanked by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>, covers up the other radiator. The remaining closet doors were replaced to match the wood veneer of the shoe storage. Each door has hidden hardware and pops open when it is pushed, eliminating the need for handles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the renovation evolved, the Sweeten contractor also installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden storage unit</a> next to the laundry to utilize every inch of space in the 790-square-foot apartment. They also encouraged Matthew to replace the window trimmings to match the custom carpentry. “We did one window first and I loved it, so we just did every window,” Matthew said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matthew has a strong affection for the color orange. Its presence in his renovation was a must. “I wanted it in there but didn’t want it to be obnoxious,” he said. After bouncing around various options of visibility, Matthew settled on adding it to the inside of his shoe closet. “You have to open the closet and pull out a drawer, but I see it every day,” he said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Custom desk (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/office/desks/parsons-desks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a>. White desk chair (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.dwr.com/kitchen-dining-chairs-benches/111-navy-chair/3773.html?lang=en_US#q=navy%2Bchair&amp;lang=en_US&amp;start=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Within Reach</a>. Orange desk lamp (in mirror reflection): ABC Home. Cabinetry and carpentry: custom. Custom bench in the living room: Room and Board.

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re like most cooks, you have a medley of spice containers in your kitchen, including some duplicates because it&#8217;s easy to forget what you already own when out food shopping. Spice storage is becoming a frequent request</span><span class="s2">—</span><span class="s1">wall niches or built-in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a>—to <span class="s1">house these valuable ingredients. Those renovating have a prime opportunity to factor this into planning their kitchen layouts because </span>the last thing you want to do is fumble around for the paprika with a hot pan on the stove. To kick your spice game up a notch, here are 5 creative ideas from Sweeten homeowners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23716 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-15-16.gif" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio and Melina&#8217;s</a> renovated kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After dealing with past kitchens that lacked storage, Fabio and Melina wanted their new kitchen to have plenty of it, especially since they both love to cook. Concealed pantry storage was built around the fridge and a pull-out drawer was added for storing spices. The spice drawer lives inside the upper lip of a much deeper drawer filled with baking essentials, maximizing the storage potential of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23717 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack for storage" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Open shelving in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/well-loved-home-begins-new-chapter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erica and Joshua&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Erica and Joshua’s kitchen, once small and cramped, needed to fit two cooks working side by side. The old kitchen was filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, a design dilemma that would be best served by custom cabinetry. To mix it up, open shelving was added, presenting the perfect solution for storing spices and cookbooks near the stove.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23718 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="Spice rack niche" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/tired-hudson-heights-home-reveals-stylish-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica and David&#8217;s</a> spice storage niche</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jessica and David decided to build a new closet along the wall separating their dining room from the kitchen so that they could use the dining room space as a bedroom in the future. Although the placement of the closet cut a chunk out of the kitchen, they were able to take back some of the lost space by carving out a niche with plenty of shelves for storing spices. As a bonus, the convenient storage also makes it easy for them to keep track of what they have in stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23722 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_KetrinaKitchen-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="spice rack custom cabinetry" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Custom cabinet in <a href="https://sweeten.com/clintonhillcoops/ketrinas-sweetened-clinton-hill-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ketrina&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In building out Ketrina’s formerly tiny kitchen with new custom cabinets, bonus upper and lower units were added to the design to make better use of the space and hide some pipes. One such cabinet placed between the stove and the window was the perfect size to store spices, proving that every inch counts when it comes to boosting storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23723 mb-0 size-chrono" title="spice rack" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="Pull-out spice rack" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Above</em>) Pull-out spice rack in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/newlywed-writers-turn-dark-kitchen-bestseller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda&#8217;s</a> Sweeten kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work-from-home writers Amanda and her husband cook often and wanted a kitchen in which they&#8217;d feel comfortable working in together. With a sizable collection of seasonings, a pull-out spice rack was added next to the stove and cleverly concealed as cabinetry, making it easy for both cooks to have what they need when the recipe calls for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23282 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-13-14-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23281 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23280 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1.gif 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-09-10-1-300x200.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">From open shelves to a liquor cabinet with a garage-style door, these storage ideas can transform your kitchen (or closet!) into a fabulous home bar</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="white kitchen-recessed-lights"  class="alignnone wp-image-22989 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg" alt="white kitchen with recessed lights and white cabinets along with white door and knob after renovation" width="723" height="481" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-723x481.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LeonardSt_9.jpg 1650w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When friends come over, the first thing you do is offer them a glass of wine. That means locating the bottle of wine before heading to where the glasses are usually stored. Finally, you root through the silverware and odds-and-ends drawers until you triumphantly unearth the corkscrew. Sound familiar? Rather than storing bar essentials around the kitchen, these Sweeten homeowners opted for home bar solutions to store everything from glasses to bottles of wine, liquor, cocktail shakers, and more. Plus, homeowners Yi Tyng and Maxime even transformed a closet located directly across from their kitchen into a wine bar (and it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/the-closet-as-workspace-bedroom-or-bar.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured in <em>The New York Times</em></a>). We’ll drink to that!</span></p>
<h3>Got an empty shelf niche? Add home bar hardware to keep stemware closeby</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-22998 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Holly_Kitchen-Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /><br />

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This clever use of niche shelf space is an excellent way to store wine, cocktail, and champagne glasses so that they can dry quickly and always be within reach for a celebratory toast.</span></p>
<h3>Floating shelves showcase stemware and spirits</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Balancing a run of lower cabinets, a few open shelves act as a home bar dedicated to glassware and bar favorites make it easy to whip up drinks for company. And why not make it a home for cookbooks and cocktail recipes, too?</span></p>
<h3>Using slivers of cabinet space for bottle storage</h3>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">If you have wine, one popular way to store the bottles is on their side so that the corks don’t dry out and let air in. A custom nook with grooved edges is the perfect solution.</span></p>
<h3>Stacking shelves above a wine fridge creates a home bar nook</h3>

<p class="p1">Every inch in a studio apartment should be utilized to its full potential. By using the placement of the wine fridge as the base for a custom bar, these homeowners were able to add a countertop and shelving to store their home bar essentials and glassware in one easy-to-locate spot.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A cupboard under the stairs becomes space for spirits<br />

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">This closet, located under the stairs and directly across from the homeowners&#8217; galley kitchen, was transformed into a wine (and espresso) bar complete with open shelving, a wine fridge, and a counter with bar stools. The space also doubles as a breakfast nook.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">A garage-style door cleverly conceals cocktail-making gear<br />
