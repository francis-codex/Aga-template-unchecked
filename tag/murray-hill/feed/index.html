<h3>A fresh minimalist space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">A Manhattan apartment with wall-to-wall windows overlooking Park Avenue demands an undistracting interior. That’s just one reason why it was a match for John, a minimalist seeking to upsize in the city. The finance exec closed on the two-bedroom abode in the Murray Hill neighborhood and was committed to an expansive renovation before moving in. Aspiring to a modern, clean aesthetic, he hired <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and designer Aurora Farewell</a>, who works in New York and Connecticut, to oversee the project and to take the space to spare and spectacular. Aurora posted the project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and together with John chose their Sweeten contractor. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41911 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg" alt="portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><span class="s1">For John, the decision to finally purchase an apartment of his own in Manhattan was two-fold. First, he’d been renting for years, initially a studio and then a one-bedroom apartment, both in a nearby area of Midtown East, and he wanted more space. Second, he was ready for a serious investment: John wanted to begin building equity in a luxury apartment. What better place than in a full-service condo on a prime Park Avenue block? </span></p>

<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41902 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Expanding living space</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The 1,200-square-foot unit, which had giant, greenhouse-style windows in nearly every room, was in an upscale building in the high 30s, and had everything—room to stretch, impressive sunlight, and 24-hour views of one of the city’s best architectural catwalks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John lived in his former apartment until his new home renovation was complete. “I closed on it in July 2018 and the renovation began in October,” he said, after he had obtained building and city approvals. The new apartment, he said, more or less doubled his living space. John was an experienced renovator, having done previous construction on homes in Utah and Florida. He had a vision and a good idea of how he wanted to approach the redo. “The biggest questions I had,” he said, “were ‘<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How much will this cost</a>?’ and ‘How long will it take?’”</span></p>

<h3>Taking down walls</h3>
<p><span class="s1">The unit, in a 20-year-old building, had a layout that felt inefficient, if not unlivable, John said. His biggest gripe was an awkward partition wall that closed off the kitchen from the living and dining rooms. </span><span class="s2">According to his architect, they worked to create an open floor plan unifying the kitchen, dining, and living spaces, “as well as to allow for a more gracious master bath and master bedroom.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Next, they moved on to a long list of features and finishes, all of which, John said, was “in working condition, but dated.” A simple design was needed based on clean lines and spare decor. He favored neutral “background” colors on walls, floors and cabinets, and furnishings that were practical and useful.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41910 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Practical goals</h3>
<p><span class="s1">Aurora agreed with John’s ideas and thought they meshed perfectly with her own vision, focused largely on the apartment’s bank of east-facing windows. “The </span><span class="s2">tall panes of glass overlook the stately building façades that line Park Avenue, and up to the sky,” she said. “The morning light in the apartment was beautiful, and I wanted to fix the layout so that John could appreciate it in full.” As it was, she said, the window wall’s impressive span was broken by the kitchen partition, plopped right in the middle of—and from either side blocking—the breathtaking view.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After reviewing the multiple Sweeten bids, Aurora and John decided on their contractor, who coordinated with them and advised on a number of aspects of the project. In addition to the literal big picture, Aurora and John had practical goals. “I was hoping to not have to use my oven for file storage anymore,” he said, stressing that this was not an exaggeration. </span></p>
<p><span class="s3"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41907 size-full" title="dining space" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg" alt="dining space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41894 mb-0 size-full" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg" alt="bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding hidden storage</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Seeking to maximize the amount of storage space in the apartment without compromising on design, they decided to rip out the wall between the kitchen and dining area, which came at the expense of the pre-existing utility closets that had been built into it. To compensate, the contractor built two closets on opposite walls of the dining area, one to accommodate coats and luggage, and the other to store sporting goods and other sundry stuff. With that wall out of the way, the contractor’s team installed the new kitchen comprising slate-gray designer cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops, and high-end stainless-steel appliances.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Storage was a priority for other rooms as well. In the master bedroom, the plan dictated bumping into the current clothes closet, which would then be expanded on the opposite side, in addition to building a new shoe closet. The guest bedroom, which would also function as John’s home office, would be kitted out with enclosed cabinets and shelving.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41895 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg" alt="bathroom cabinet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Gutted bathrooms with complete upgrades</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The bathrooms, both of which were gut-renovated, received complete upgrades with porcelain tile, patterns, and custom millwork. In the master bathroom, Aurora increased the functionality with a new linen closet, which the contractor bumped into a wall in order to build. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The<span style="color: #333333;"> six-</span>month renovation went smoothly, John said, with “no major hiccups along the way,” save the necessary pulling of an unanticipated permit from the New York City Department of Buildings before the removal of the kitchen partition. The wall, the architect explained, was non-load-bearing but still tricky to take down, since it was part of the building’s original construction plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41896 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3>Crediting the contractors</h3>
<p><span class="s1">John credited his Sweeten contractor as a key player in the project, noting that the building team was among the critical reasons why the project was a success. He suggested taking all you can from the experts you’ve assembled to help you through the project, while at the same time tuning in to your own intuition. “Once you make a decision,” he said, “stick with it. Otherwise, you run the risk of not only second-guessing yourself, but of delaying delivery of materials and installation. If one step in the process is delayed, it can have a domino effect on subsequent tasks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">John said that those steps, at least when they proceeded smoothly, were some of the most satisfying components of the job, day-by-day, and week-by-week, as he watched his new space change. What came slowly at the beginning then accelerated, transforming to progress and carrying through to a pleasing conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I feel,” John said, “like I’ve found not just a place to live and sleep, but a permanent home in the city.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you, John, for sharing your new home with us!</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s1">DESIGN NOTES FROM ARCHITECT AURORA FAREWELL AS TOLD TO SWEETEN:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We wanted to appreciate the natural light in full. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by the dividing wall, home to closets and a massive fridge. We agreed a continuous row of windows would be better. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We relied on light fixtures to act as focal points in the space and to illuminate the client’s artwork without needing to use additional art lights. Two brass wall sconces are placed strategically in the living room to provide ambient light, and a statement fixture anchors the kitchen area,  illuminating across the entire length of the island. Both this and the oversized dining room pendant act as sculptural elements. Carefully placed 3-inch ceiling soffits facilitated critical adjustments in architectural lighting, including the addition of the beautiful kitchen island pendant, without sacrificing overall ceiling height. The fireplace surround and hearth were redone in slate with a minimal, painted mantel.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41912 size-full" title="entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In the dining area, symmetric closets flanking the dining table replace the storage lost in the removal of the functional wall and closet bank separating the kitchen and living room. </span><span class="s1">The kitchen island is Calacatta marble with waterfall sides that give it weight despite its smallish scale; it stands as an object in the kitchen and speaks to the elliptical dining table, which has similar marble veining. </span><span class="s2">By downsizing the dishwasher, we created space for the refrigerator to move, while maintaining critical site lines throughout the apartment. The architectural moves are simple, but bring coherence to the overall plan.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Manhattan home renovates with the right materials and storage</h2>
<p><em>Christina had wanted to remodel her circa 1959 studio co-op in Murray Hill for the five years she’d been living in it. The kitchen and the bathroom were dated, lacked storage space, and were poorly lit. Each year, she&#8217;d revisit the idea of remodeling—even meeting with contractors—but the timing never seemed right between personal and professional commitments (she&#8217;s a financial executive). Hearing so many renovation horror stories also made her hesitate. She discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and took the big step forward. Christina <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27878">posted her project,</a> was matched <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractors</a> and made her selection. Here, she tells her story.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Christina in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>Putting all my renovation fears aside, I felt my 550-square-foot studio space was not an accurate reflection of my style. The kitchen and bathroom were not well thought out, and the apartment really lacked adequate storage space. For the kitchen, I just used to ignore it by avoiding it altogether, but I couldn’t keep doing that. When I finally met the right contractor through the help of Sweeten, I felt the time had arrived to move forward with updating the space.</p>

<p>Even though it was the kitchen and bath renovations that drove me to get started, there were other things that needed updating. The walls were slightly bumpy in some areas, so I had them <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> [spreading a thin coat of joint compound or &#8220;mud&#8221; on the wall, and then scraping it away to leave a smooth layer] to make everything look as sleek as possible. Also as an artist, I have several of my oil paintings hanging throughout the apartment, so the walls were not all that noticeable, but <span style="color: #000000;">once you update one thing, the flaws in other areas really start to show.</span> Although not part of the original plan, the floors were changed. Upgrading the weak lighting was also a high priority.</p>
<p>My vision for the whole apartment was to look serene, timeless, and glamorous—without overdoing it. I wanted to keep things relatively neutral because my artwork adds pops of color; I didn’t want to create additional “noise.”</p>

<p>The small kitchen didn’t support the existing full-size appliances and was awkward to move around in. The refrigerator was too big and the kitchen lacked counter space, mostly due to a huge sink. That was the number one thing I wanted to correct. With little room to put anything (six inches of usable workspace), I ended up using a foldable table hung on the wall. I could not wait to remove that! The cabinets did not go up to the ceiling—another waste of a significant amount of space that could have been used for storage. The overall configuration became more efficient with a smaller sink and new ceiling-height cabinets. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>In the bathroom, there was an old pedestal-style sink, leaving no storage space underneath. I have a ton of stuff and am also a neat freak, so I needed all the storage space I could get. I love mirrors that double as storage and insisted on having a larger medicine cabinet. This was a challenge because we had building pipes running behind where the cabinet would be fastened. We found a solution by combining two different-sized ones together; it looks amazing. In both the kitchen and bathroom, I paired Calacatta marble with wood-looking floor tiles for continuity. I knew that was the look I wanted even before shopping for materials. My contractor played an integral role in selecting the materials, offering a lot of ideas on what would look good and what might not work. He also helped <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customize the kitchen cabinets</a>.</p>
<p>I admit I have expensive taste, and sometimes I got carried away with wanting very high-end materials. My contractor helped me stay on track and we found a lot of reasonably priced options at Home Depot for things like light fixtures.</p>

<p>The original floors were damaged by water from a pipe bursting. I wanted a high contrast between the floors and walls and couldn’t believe what a huge difference it gave to the look and vibe of the apartment. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof layer</a> was included per the building’s request. The entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.</p>
<p>I was most excited about redoing the kitchen; that was the area that bothered me the most. The thought of having everything finally the way I wanted it (within the constraints of the building requirements and existing structure) made me very happy. I was also really excited to be involved in every aspect of the project and learning about construction in Manhattan. After investing a lot of time and energy into the new finishes and design, I feel a greater sense of emotional ownership towards everything in my home. I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, but I can&#8217;t wait to leverage the new appliances and kitchen to their full potential.</p>
<p>The space is now an accurate reflection of my style and personality. It makes me feel at peace and happy to come home every day knowing every single thing is exactly how I wanted it. I feel a great sense of pride in the final product.</p>
