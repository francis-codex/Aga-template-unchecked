<h3>A new art deco apartment home<span>—in need of work</span></h3>
<p>Lindsay, Nicholas, and their cat, Sibyl, returned to New York City after two years in Baltimore and landed on a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in upper Manhattan. “Nicholas fell in love with the [art deco] lobby, and we both loved that it was right across the street from Inwood Hill Park and has a killer view of the Cloisters,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p>The apartment itself was so-so. It had some classic art deco features, like a sunken living room with herringbone wood floors, which Lindsay and Nicholas wanted to mix with their mid-century tastes. A bland kitchen and bathroom needed some help. The molding, doors, and paint were also due for a refresh. And then there were those two things many New Yorkers consider an ultimate luxury<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/9735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their art deco apartment remodel</a> and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a> to execute the construction and the design. Lindsay and Nicholas were given a six- to eight-week timeline from start to finish and camped out in a sublet during the renovation. A few hiccups along the way stretched that timeline (more on that later).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42173" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan.jpg" alt="Brooklyn floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN-Lindsay-Robbins-Before-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was to gut renovate the bathroom and make minor changes in the kitchen while doing mostly cosmetic updates to the rest of the apartment. A standout feature in the living area is the sliver of wallpaper that peaks out from the small hallway off of the living room. “Since it’s such a small space, we figured we could go a little crazy,” said Lindsay. That “little crazy” translated to an art deco-style wallpaper with teal, purple, and gold accents. “Even our friends who hate patterns and bright colors love it,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-Before-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen renovation before" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-Before-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-Before-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-Before-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42174 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Kitchen renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42167" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Cabinet refinish" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the current layout had a nook where the previous owners had placed a small breakfast table. Lindsay saw this as an ideal way to add more counter space. There was a miniature dishwasher “which made no sense since there was plenty of room for a full one,” said Lindsay. Rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut renovate</a> the kitchen (a decision the couple later regretted), they refinished the existing “country-style” cabinets in a gray modern tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark grout in the backsplash tiles upped the modern feel. The only appliance they replaced was that tiny dishwasher. “We are happy with how it came out,” said Lindsay, “but salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the only original feature that remains is the cast-iron tub with its detailed edges. Lindsay and Nicholas had it re-enameled so it matched the new bathroom. A new washer/dryer would replace an existing shower area and a shower would be added to the bathtub. For maximal storage, shelving lined the laundry wall in hard-to-reach places and double doors were installed to hide the clutter.</p>
<p>When the decision came to choose either a console sink or a vanity, they decided on a console. (The under-the-sink space became the new location for Sibyl&#8217;s litter box.) For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>, a large medicine cabinet, and niche shelves along the bathroom and shower walls did the trick. A matte black hexagonal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> became the new backdrop in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp" alt="black and white bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57241 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature the couple recommends to other renovators is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>. To remedy some oddly-placed shelves and a rod, their Sweeten contractor ripped everything out of the bedroom closet and installed a new system that can easily be changed later on as storage needs shift. “Custom designing the closets made a huge difference in how useful the spaces were,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-04.gif" alt="Washer dryer renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project hit a major snag when it came to the electrical work which pushed the end date back. Wiring dedicated to powering the washer/dryer had to be installed and ripped out twice from the ceiling. Despite this, it still shorted out the power after only a few uses. In the end, it was discovered there was a faulty part in the basement and the situation was fixed. Throughout the issue, Sweeten&#8217;s customer service, which checks in on renovations until projects are completed, stayed in communication until it was resolved and helped coordinate a new realistic timeline agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After their experience, Lindsay and Nicholas came out with a home they loved, but also some things they would do differently next time. “Always gut renovate,” said Lindsay. “We were trying to be thrifty by keeping the kitchen cabinets.” The other tip: plan for the renovation to take twice as long. But ultimately, the Sweeten contractor did a fantastic job,” said Lindsay<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and enhanced the features of the apartment to turn it into a unique home for their family.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and her husband bought their first apartment last year in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. It was originally a one-bedroom co-op, but they benefitted from some renovations the previous owners had done, including cordoning off space for a second bedroom. Architectural details such as an ornate archway were also intact, giving it the perfect amount of charm. On the other hand, the bathroom needed some work, as did the hodgepodge of cabinets in the kitchen. With two small kids, Sarah also saw a peace-giving opportunity to swap out flimsy doors on the second bedroom for something with a little more soundproofing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though they closed on the apartment in November, Sarah and her husband rented the apartment back to the former owners during the planning stages of the renovation. By the time the building’s board approved the plans, “we ended up with just five weeks to get the work done, including over Christmas and New Years,” said Sarah. They were moving in February 1. With the holiday season in full swing, they had trouble finding a contractor up for the tight timeframe challenge. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah came to Sweeten</a>, a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free service that connects homeowners</a> with vetted general contractors, to find someone for the job. “It came down to the wire,” said Sarah. “<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Sweeten contractor</a> and team were still painting as we were moving in.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as kitchens go, the kitchen in the apartment wasn’t half bad. It had an open plan that fed into the living room, wooden countertops, and a farmhouse-style sink. However, cream backsplash tiles that culminated in a heavy printed pattern above the sink weighed the whole thing down. “The real goal in all of this was to make everything as clean and minimalistic as possible,” said Sarah. The mismatch of cabinets also needed to have one cohesive look. The couple went for open shelving to make the kitchen feel bigger. They also loved the idea of showing off their dishes. “They are really beautiful and we don’t mind looking at them all the time,” said Sarah. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> below the counter were from Ikea and were perfectly fine, but they had wanted to replace them with flat fronts for a minimalist aesthetic. However, for new homeowners, that was a few steps over the budget line. Instead, the hardware was swapped out for a bold gold. “It completely changed their look,” said Sarah. &#8220;We&#8217;re very happy with the result.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One archway in the kitchen was in the original Art Deco style (the building was built in 1938), so Sarah’s Sweeten contractor was asked to mirror the design on an adjacent archway—previously a doorframe. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t sure that was possible, but he did an amazing job!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29136 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Kristen Amato-Bathroom-Before04" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28709 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom received the most extensive makeover of the project. The floors needed to be re-tiled with a new shower fixture and vanity added. “It never felt very clean,” said Sarah, of the existing bathroom, which had black floor tiles. “It&#8217;s a small space so we went with all white to make it feel as open as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the archways in the kitchen, Sarah wanted to keep some of the old detail. In the bathroom, that meant keeping the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub</a>. Its light salmon pink gives the bathroom an understated drop of color. It was also easier to let it remain where it was. &#8220;That&#8217;s a cast iron tub and it weighs a ton! We thought, just keep it and make everything else white.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom provided the couple a chance to add a nod to a favorite style, Shaker architecture. Instead of using typical towel rails, Sarah had a peg rail made by a Shaker workshop in Massachusetts. “It turns out to be really handy to have a lot of pegs,” she said. “We use them for towels and drying clothes for the baby.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28713 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest part of the renovation turned out to be not so. It turned out that the new doors for the nursery weren&#8217;t made to be as soundproof as they used to be. The couple’s Sweeten contractor suggested a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid core door</a> rather than one with MDF (medium-density fiberboard) cores, which can be pushovers when it comes to noise. However, “it turns out solid core is incredibly difficult to find these days,” said Sarah. She only found one option in an extensive search. It turned out to be the perfect fit. Well, almost. The floors were uneven. That meant the new doors needed to be sanded down for a snug fit. The couple also handmade some leather pulls instead of using door knobs. Now, Sarah and her husband are enjoying the fruits of their efforts. “Our girls snooze away while we watch movies or entertain right outside their door,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The priority was using paint that was as non-toxic as possible, a subject Sarah is very serious about, in light of research linking volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from certain objects and liquids, like paint, to cancer. While some fancier brands had whites the couple liked, they decided to keep their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a> in mind and went with something more economical that was also VOC-free. That turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint,” said Sarah, “and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this project, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-week timeline</a> wasn’t the only thing that was tight. Sarah and her husband were focused on sticking to their budget. The couple worked closely with their Sweeten contractor to keep costs low in other areas, such as picking up some materials and supplies themselves. It turned out to be a lot of work, including a run out to New Jersey to get tiles, paint, and grout. However, the strategy had a valuable fringe benefit. “It made us very involved in the project,” said Sarah. “We made every decision along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>
