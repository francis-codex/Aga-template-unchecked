<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Making the decision in a work-from-home moment</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">When it came to this renovation and our decisions about it, the pandemic was a true influence. Kevin and I previously lived in a two-bedroom apartment, using one bedroom as an office—but working from home, we needed more space. I am a television producer and Kevin is a broadcast engineer. In the end, never leaving home was the motivator we needed to make a move.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We found a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-bedroom house</a> in L.A.’s Westchester neighborhood with plans to use two of the bedrooms as our home offices. Added bonus: the property also had the backyard that we and our dogs, Joey and Stevie, wanted.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Hiring a qualified general contractor—with guidance</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">As first-timers for a renovation of this scale, we had questions. The biggest ones: How long it would take and how much it would cost? The team at <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> guided us through the process of getting bids from several contractors, and the website prepared us for <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what to expect</a> during work. Ultimately, Sweeten connected us with a great contractor.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Updating the house mechanics</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our home was built in 1950 and, with a previous renovation, gained an addition in the ‘60s, including the living room, primary bedroom, and a half-bath. But before beginning, we had dirty work to do. We replaced the sewer line to the street and pipes under the house, tented the house for termites, reinforced the foundation, and updated the electrical.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49424 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19.jpg" alt="Image of Los Angeles homeowners sitting in living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s8">&#8220;We felt a true match with our contractor and I love how our home turned out: clean and solid.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The renovation plan included several phases. First, we wanted to lay new flooring throughout the house. We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks, to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive. We felt that lighter floors would complement the living room’s existing natural wood ceiling. In fact, our vision for the space was guided by that beamed ceiling, and a desire to open the home’s center, front to back.</span></p>
<h3>A wider and elongated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We met with our contractor and his in-house kitchen designer. Most importantly, we wanted to discuss how to increase flow to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L-shaped kitchen</a>. We decided to widen the kitchen doorway and remove part of the 6.5-foot wall that separated it from the living room. We planned to build a long, modern peninsula to draw the kitchen through the opening and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrate it with the living space</a>. It would make the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen more functional</a>. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49440 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1.jpg" alt="Image of kitchen cabinets with brass fixtures and white counters" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We stacked and boxed in the washer and dryer and created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. That gave us room to add a large pantry in the kitchen space. Our contractor’s crew custom-built the cabinets and suggested matte brass hardware and fixtures, which we love. Choosing the countertop stone took time—after researching online, we visited stone yards and showrooms before agreeing on a light-gray quartz. </span></p>
<p>We originally planned to paint the shiplap walls in the kitchen white, but after the walls were sanded and primed, we opted for the white-washed look instead. We could always paint it later if we changed our minds.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">A private bathroom for each family member</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Next came the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>. We don&#8217;t really have a primary—it&#8217;s more like <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“his” and “hers.”</a> I claimed the one with the bathtub and my husband got the other one, a half-bath when we bought the house. Part of the 1960s renovation, it was odd, narrow, and tight with its very own exterior door! We redesigned it, finding space for a shower by removing the door and an adjacent window, and bumping out approximately 20 inches into the breakfast nook area. Since we were removing the natural light sources, our contractor suggested adding a skylight. We’re happy we took this idea.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49439 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg" alt="Image of a bathroom with wood sink vanity and black sink backsplash" width="666" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg 666w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49438 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated bathroom tub with white subway tile walls" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Like Kevin’s, my bathroom also got a makeover. We installed new tile, fixtures, a vanity, and hardware. One other idea we got from our contractor was to choose wall-mounted toilets. The bathrooms are small—mine, especially—and the streamlined toilets free up vital inches.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49434 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated white tile bathroom with walk-in shower and skylight" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Shopping for materials</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We sourced most materials ourselves. At the project’s start, our contractor gave us a preferred vendor list, which helped us to know where to shop for tile, plumbing fixtures, and other essentials. When we visited brick-and-mortar locations, we researched first and knew exactly what to look at. I understand why people <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with designers</a>! We made a lot of decisions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Connect with Sweeten contractors</span></a></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Shopping for lighting fixtures was fun, though. A friend who worked at a lighting showroom recommended a woman-owned Portland lighting company, leading us to beautiful choices for the bathrooms, kitchen, and bedroom. The pandemic definitely affected the supply chain: A refrigerator order took six months to arrive.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49425 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The renovators’ learning curve</span></h3>
<p>As two people with no major renovation experience, it felt like a challenge. Fortunately, we were lucky to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor who guided us</a>. We learned a lot about balancing time and budget—how long things would take and the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effect on cost</a>. Sweeten’s check-ins gave us peace of mind; I knew I could ask questions if issues arose. My advice to other renovators is, make sure your <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor is licensed and insured</a>, and consider whether you can communicate clearly with him or her—you need to understand each other.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We felt a true match with our contractor and I love how our home turned out: clean and solid. It’s comforting to know that things were done right. I love the final touches brought to the project by interior designer Ana DeLeon of Delena Studio, whom we hired on our contractor’s recommendation. We thought we wanted help figuring out where to hang art, but</span><span class="s9"> she advised us on rugs, too, and it was her idea to use the leather loveseat at the dining table.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">result is a gorgeous home</a> with space for both of us to do our things. I’m so happy!</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true their original purpose was solely functional, exposed beams have proven their worth beyond utility time and time again. Whether your home has an industrial, rustic, or contemporary feel, they up the drama and demand attention. These renovators, who all worked with </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, proved just how striking exposed beams really are, regardless if they’re original to a home or newly added. </span></p>
<h3><strong>A Tudor home returns to its roots with exposed beams</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41026" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-SaraAxelbaum-Home-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara and Mike gave their Tudor home a modern layout when they had their contractor knock down walls and create an open concept kitchen and dining space. To bring back more of the home’s Tudor characteristics (and to provide structural support) their contractor brought in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1930s-westchester-tudor-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exposed beams that echo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rest of the woodwork.</span></p>
<h3>1929 exposed beams preserve Parisian-chic style</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40408" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg" alt="living area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Liya-Magdeeva-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s further proof that exposed beams can work for </span> any home style<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Liya and her family’s Parisian-chic home, the contractor left the original 1929 beams intact. The white walls, ceilings, and beams create a crisp and clean look that contrasts with the dark wood floors and charcoal furnishings.</span></p>
<h3>An industrial, clean take on beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-20051 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20051 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A renovation surprise may not always be a good thing, but in the case of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ </a>Williamsburg loft remodel, it most certainly was. Their top-floor unit with a terrace, parking space, and sky-high ceilings offered another benefit: original beams. Much to the couple’s delight, their contractor proposed they open up the walls and ceiling encasing building beams in the kitchen and living room. “This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements,” Lia said.</p>
<h3>Once hidden behind walls, beams become new focal point</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-24689 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24689 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Brett_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meg and Brett’s</a> carriage home in Hamilton Heights was already chockful of historical charm, and once they exposed the original beams, it went to the next level. How they found the beams is a story in itself: “We walked around and knocked on the drywall—if it felt hollow, we put a hole through to see what was underneath,” Brett said. They came across different sets: wooden ones original to the carriage house, and iron beams installed to support the structure. “Some of the beams had initials in them, and we even found a horsehair or two caught in the wood,” he added.</p>
<h3>Exposed beams add character (and even out ceilings!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-21828 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21828 mb-0 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You know how the saying goes, if you don’t have it, add it. Jessica and David’s 875-square-foot apartment in Hudson Heights saw a lot of updates to make it work for their family. One stylistic addition they requested? Exposed beams. They wanted to bring more character to the space and as it turned out, the update served a dual purpose: the beams placed on the ceiling helped conceal an unfortunate spot where the ceiling was higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Recessed lighting within beams adds light, separation</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-32367 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32367 size-full" title="gray-living-space-recessed-lights" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="gray living space with recessed lights on ceiling and couch along with white round breakfast table and chairs after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-EricBormel-Kitchen02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>First-time renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather and Eric</a> took on a dark co-op apartment renovation in Manhattan with the intention to lighten and open up the barren space. To turn the blank canvas into a home with more interesting detail, plus tackle a need for overhead lighting, they added non-support beams in the living room and bedroom. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The structures offered a stylish and unique lighting solution that felt inherent to the home. </span></p>
<h3>Cobble Hill home goes to new heights after finding hidden beams</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-26642 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26642 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="exposed beams, home renovation, design, construction, open living" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
It’s amazing what can be unveiled in a renovation. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel</a> set to renovate his “bland, cookie-cutter, white box” of an apartment in Cobble Hill and to his total surprise, learned it wasn’t so ordinary. The contractor was fixing some electrical issues and came across a brick wall, and then a ceiling of beautiful beams! Since the ceilings weren’t very high, Miguel decided to paint them white to make the apartment feel bigger and brighter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A tasteful and timely makeover for an 875-square-foot coop</h2>
<p>When a job necessitated a move from a Westchester suburb to New York City, Jessica and her husband, David, hoped for a move-in-ready apartment. Relocating is never simple, and undertaking a renovation was not in the plan. But when the search turned up an outdated (but otherwise perfect) Hudson Heights apartment with a show-stopping view of the George Washington Bridge, they knew it was time to find a contractor. See how the couple used artful ideas to maximize storage space, make room for guests, and enlarge a common living area.</p>
<p><span id="more-21812"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21814 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-936x700.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07" width="936" height="700" /></span></p>
<p>Despite the beautiful bridge view, a renovation was in order: the 875-square-foot apartment was in a co-op building that had been built in 1917, and while parts of the unit had been updated since, Jessica and David had very specific ideas about how to make it work for their family. Some friends, wishing they had used Sweeten themselves, suggested that the duo try out the service. After consulting Sweeten’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/"> Renovation 101 series</a> and perusing the<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/"> Before &amp; Afters</a> to get a sense of the possibilities, Jessica<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7368"> posted their project</a> while the property went into contract. The plans called for the conversion of the dining room into a second bedroom, a completely reworked kitchen, refinished floors and moldings, as well as minor updates in the bathroom. Jessica set up site visits with her Sweeten matches, and ultimately decided on this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757">general contractor</a>, who, coincidentally, lived in the sister building next door. (Apparently, his own floor plan was so similar to Jessica and David’s, he told them that working on their place was “like what he always wanted to do to his own apartment!”) They liked that his was a design-build firm, which provides both interior design and general contracting services. As a &#8220;design-conscious builder,&#8221; he could assist them in making design decisions to achieve the bright and modern look they imagined.</p>

<p>First, they worked together to address the issues in the kitchen. Since the room faced another part of their building, it did not receive much natural light. An earlier attempt (by previous owners) at brightening the space had resulted in an “awful fluorescent yellow” paint on the walls, which clashed with the light tone of the existing wood cabinets and the orange tile on the floor. Aesthetics aside, the kitchen also did not provide enough functional storage: the only wall of cabinets also housed all the appliances. Inside one cabinet, an unmovable gas meter obstructed any usable space, and a steam riser in a corner wasted valuable square footage. The placement of the extra-wide doorway between the kitchen and the old dining room prevented the addition of a parallel wall of cabinets on the other side. And although the existing stove was in good shape, Jessica and David wanted to switch out the other appliances for energy-efficient alternatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21818 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>To create better flow and maximize function, the doorway to the living area was narrowed and moved to the side, making way for a full galley kitchen. A dropped ceiling was also raised to maximize vertical storage. All the appliances remained on the original bank of cabinets, so the (newly built) opposite side could be dedicated entirely to storage in the form of drawers, open shelving, a custom niche for spices, as well as a full-height pantry. In the corner where the steam riser stood, the contractor fabricated cabinet panels with a perforated insert to create a more uniform look. Now, the riser is hidden from view, but the narrow vertical space also serves as extra storage for cleaning supplies. Their Sweeten contractor created a similar solution for the gas meter, wrapping custom shelves around the meter so that the inside of the cabinet was not completely wasted. The couple’s desire for a “bright, clean look” was achieved with pure white shaker cabinets, recycled glass countertops in a light beige, and a white farmhouse sink. Jessica was especially excited about adding a scatter of color in the backsplash with Mexican tiles she sourced from Etsy. For the floor, cork tiles were chosen as a sustainable and renewable material that’s both soundproof and mildew-proof.</p>

<p>Next, there came a change in plans. Although the intention was to create a guest bedroom out of the original dining room, Jessica and David quickly realized that they preferred to keep the space open for their own daily use. As a compromise, they built a closet against the new wall separating the dining room and kitchen. This way, a bedroom could be added down the line and it would already have its own closet. For now, they came up with a simple but genius solution for a flexible guest room: their contractor installed a pocket door between the living area and the kitchen, allowing visitors the option of transforming the entire living/dining room into a private suite.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21820 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08 (1)" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p>Their general contractor went to work replacing the crumbly moldings and refinishing the worn floors in the new living area, made newly spacious by the removal of original walls that bracketed the formal dining room. Door moldings in the dining room were salvaged as replacement window trim for the living area. While making these repairs, he realized that there was empty space under each window ledge, which could be repurposed as built-in shelving. He also suggested painting the black window frames white to further brighten the space&#8211;a suggestion that Jessica loved. In addition, the couple requested new wooden beams on the ceiling for character—but it turns out they serve a dual purpose. There was a “step” in the ceiling, and the beams placed there helped to conceal the awkward transition where one part of the ceiling was higher than the other. Interestingly, numerous pieces of plywood were joined to fabricate the beam, which is actually hollow. This was both a greener and more affordable solution than procuring a solid piece of wood.</p>

<p>Although the renovation went smoothly for the most part, Jessica and David did run into a few challenges. First—and this is something we at Team Sweeten hear time and time again—they were held up by permits and approvals. To remove the dining room walls, they needed co-op board approval, which took about a month longer than they had anticipated. On another occasion, they were ordered to stop work for a day because of a misunderstanding about some wiring. The super had given the okay to cut old fabric-wrapped wires that were part of an obsolete intercom system, but it turned out that they connected a neighbor’s functioning phone lines! Thankfully, they were able to repair the lines and continue working the next day.</p>
<p>Jessica and David had never renovated in New York City before, and had dozens of questions when they started out. Now that they’ve lived to tell the tale, they have a couple pieces of advice to share with aspiring renovators: “Build in some extra time—everything takes longer than it should!” (That’s why renovators should always build in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/">at least two to six months for permits and approvals</a>.) Despite the lengthier-than-anticipated renovation, they are so happy to have a custom-built home that not only suits their every need, but is environmentally friendly and energy efficient to boot!</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Jessica and David, for sharing your beautiful new apartment with us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56288 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>
