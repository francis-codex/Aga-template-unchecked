<p><em>Guest post by Sweeten homeowner Rachel</em></p>
<h5>A Manhattan duplex remodel (instead of moving)</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our first home, which we bought about six years ago just after we got married. When we were planning to expand our family, we knew we had to renovate or move. There was enough square footage, but we needed more distinct rooms or spaces. The apartment is a duplex co-op in Greenwich Village which was built in 1910. We love Greenwich Village so much and I really wanted to have the experience of raising a baby here. So, we renovated!</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living here for so long before the renovation was really helpful since it gave us plenty of time to think about the best possible use of the space. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath, but wanted another bedroom for a baby. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/swap-rooms-better-layout-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old layout didn&#8217;t really work for entertaining</a>, either—the kitchen and dining room were upstairs while the living room was downstairs. Marco and I also wanted our own personal spaces within our home for his hobbies and for my closet/office. Overall, we hoped to create a comfortable family home that met everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always thought of our apartment as a hidden gem—a colorful, fun place where you could see a little girl growing up, sophisticated yet flexible enough to allow for events like playdates and parties. The general contractors we found through Sweeten were really amazing. On top of being creative problem solvers, they were incredibly nice guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The top floor would be a combined kitchen/dining/living area, so the kitchen needed to be functional but also beautiful enough for a dinner party. We hid most of the appliances behind paneled cabinets; an &#8220;appliance garage&#8221; and snack storage were organized inside hallway cabinets outfitted with marble countertops. When we have family-style dinners, we set up the self-serve dishes and bar in those spaces. So, yes, you&#8217;re in a kitchen, but it&#8217;s also an elegant dining room.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>Customizing the almost-black kitchen</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cook a lot and was so excited for the stove. I wanted one of those fancy French stoves that come in custom colors, but they are so expensive! Instead, I found one from a U.S. manufacturer for maybe one-third the price. (They also do custom colors.) The cabinet color was chosen to match the stove, so this appliance is &#8220;hidden,&#8221; too. We wanted something different from the typical all-white kitchen that would also complement the light wood floors. This almost-black shade is just a little more interesting than plain black. It took lots of trips to the paint store for swatches!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We put a lot of thought into maximizing space and brainstorming with our Sweeten contractors. We really pushed them to be creative. I just kept saying, &#8220;We need to hide the trash and we need a spice cabinet. Where can we do it?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t let up! The answer was wrapping the cabinets around the pillar and also where the lower cabinets end, which created a finished look. There were other details: I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with big molding</a>. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with big molding. I chose the largest size I could find for the ceilings, doors, and floors! It makes a big difference for not a huge cost.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few challenges, like the flooring. It took a couple of tries to get it just right, including completely refinishing the downstairs floors more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the fireplace, which was very old and didn&#8217;t work. Our contractors figured out it was a faux fireplace that took up space for no reason, so it was removed.</p>
<h5>Matching new and old brick</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also needed to make our brand-new brick match with the brick from 1910. Our contractors came up with a solution that was even better than what we had imagined. We repaired some portions, which was very expensive, and painted the wall solid white, stripping that paint off layer by layer to create the current washed effect. That helped to blend the new and (very) old brick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom needed updating, too. It was really old with a weirdly-shaped, very deep, mini tub. We installed a beautiful regular-sized tub and shower tile I had seen in another project our contractors had done, which I loved. I pushed hard to put in a double-wide mirror, even though there were a lot of issues with making a recessed cabinet fit the space. I&#8217;m glad I persevered because it makes the room so much bigger.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h5>A bedroom transforms into personal hobby spaces</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marco and I have always believed in having our own spaces. We divided what used to be a huge bedroom into two separate spaces to create his office and my closet. Marco needed his own space where he could work on his hobbies without driving me crazy! He likes to do things that create dust and noise and play his music really loud. He works hard during the week, so he should have a place to do that! The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">office is actually soundproofed</a> so he won&#8217;t wake the baby.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32176 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-couch-blue-wall-painting" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg" alt="blue couch and blue painting on wall and brick wall with metal open shelf" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Sweeten was great; they continually checked in with us. I knew I could go to them if there was ever an issue with our contractor. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you need to pick finishes in person whenever possible. It&#8217;s really hard to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like on a computer screen.</p>

<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="Duplex floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>

<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg" alt="living room leading to outdoors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room</em></span></p>
<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"> A new layout reveals a design that is just right</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ting and S. moved back to their New York co-op after four years of living abroad, Ting, an architect, had an opportunity to remodel the fixer-upper they had been renting out. They now had a 6-month-old, so not only did they need a second bedroom in their almost 1,000<span style="color: #000000;">-square-foot space</span>, but they also needed to make more efficient use of wide hallways and under-utilized closets. The couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to bring in additional bids to a few other contractors they found through friends. At decision time, the duo chose to hire <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten contractor</a> to begin building their new home. </i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an architect, renovating your own home is both a dream and a rite of passage. So when it came time to purchase our own apartment, I secretly hoped we’d find one with enough square footage but in desperate need of TLC.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We decided on Midtown Manhattan for the location, so we could both walk to work, and after months of searching, we found a large one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op, nearly a thousand square feet in a postwar building that fit the bill perfectly: it had a smart layout that featured a windowed dining alcove; three poorly-utilized but large closets; and extra wide hallway with doors that just gathered dust. The finishes showed significant wear and tear as well: the kitchen was so outdated it had metal cabinets, its linoleum floor tiles were crumbling under our feet, and the bathroom’s blue tiles were screaming for a change. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But thanks to the 80/20 carpeting co-op rule, the parquet flooring was in great shape!

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast-forward four years and a tenant later, we came back to New York City with a 6-month-old in tow. We felt the urgency to renovate more than ever before. I knew I had my work cut out for me. I also had just started my own design practice to work from home—what better way to show my work than to live in my own design? </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">S. and I have similar tastes: we like clean lines, and simple, classic materials and color palettes. He has a penchant for mid-century and I have a soft spot for modern, but it was not difficult to marry the two. We chose a white base palette, accented with mix-and-matched metal hardware to create visual interest but not clutter. With the low ceilings in a postwar co-op, the color palette really helped to brighten the space. The real design challenge we faced was creating an additional bedroom and utilizing the storage spaces more efficiently.</span></p>

The result? A perfect two-bedroom home with a roomy open kitchen and living space for entertaining, a large bathroom to accommodate a growing family, a cozy baby nursery, and a king-sized master bedroom with a walk-in closet!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it came time to selecting a contractor to carry out our dream-home renovation, I first asked my friends in the field to recommend contractors they have worked with. In the meantime, while searching online I came across Sweeten’s website and immediately thought, &#8220;What a good idea!&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After reading testimonials, I decided to post our project on the site. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why not get a few more bids to compare!</a> Despite our relatively small scope (I only posted the kitchen and nursery as Phase One), we were matched with four contractors to start, and, after speaking with each one on the phone, I decided to interview two of them in person, along with a contractor recommended by a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">When I first met our Sweeten general contractor, his calm demeanor and knowledgeable answers stood out among the rest. Matching these qualities was his higher bid. Sweeten helped us level the bids across the final two, vouched for his quality, and we are glad we picked him! He acted as a true partner during this entire renovation, worked with my design challenges enthusiastically, and delivered a home that we couldn’t be prouder to call our own.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Outdated units merge into a family home in Manhattan</h2>
<p><i>Megan and Zack thought a one-bedroom apartment would be sufficient space for them—and maybe a child down the line—when they purchased their home in a 1928 co-op building in Carnegie Hill, Manhattan. A year of living in the space, however, changed their perspective. The good news? Luck was on their side, as a one-bedroom next door became available. They set out to combine the two apartments and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885"><i>posted their project on Sweeten</i></a><em>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. </em><i>With their contractor by their side, they reimagined a home fit for them and (spoiler alert!) their little one.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36550 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-04.jpg" alt="apartment combination, design, construction, kitchen, Carnegie Hill, Manhattan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Lau-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<i>Guest post by homeowner Megan</i></p>
<p>When Zack and I came across a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op building in the Carnegie Hill neighborhood of Manhattan, I convinced him we could “Marie Kondo” our lives and one day raise a child in the minimalist 600 square feet. As we went through the process of buying the apartment, sharing our entire financial histories, tax returns, and hopes and dreams for the future with each other (and the bank and co-op board), we began to affectionately call each other tenants-in-common.</p>
<p>The first time we entered our new apartment after closing, Zack proposed in the living room. Months later at City Hall, we discovered that it’s easier to get a marriage license than a mortgage.</p>
<p>A year into living in our new place, it became clear the apartment was in dire need of a renovation, and space would be tight if we ever had a child—even if we committed to the life-changing magic of tidying up. When we discovered the one-bedroom apartment next to ours was available, our “it’s so crazy, it just might work” plan to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combine the two units</a> went into action, and we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project on Sweeten</a>. Before finding Sweeten, the sketchiness factor of finding a contractor was a bit high for our comfort. In contrast, Sweeten’s process felt legitimate and professional. We were impressed with the three contractors we matched with and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this general contractor</a>.</p>

<p>Our original apartment had only one street-facing window, a single light in each room, and was very dark. Plus, it had bold wallpaper and flashy light fixtures that just weren’t our taste. The second one we bought hadn’t been touched in decades. Combining both of them would allow us to rethink the space to suit our needs and lifestyle. The new layout and recessed lighting allowed us to brighten up the space.</p>
<p>We made one kitchen bigger and eliminated the other to create a living room, and the former living room became our master bedroom. Our old bedroom became a nursery, although we called it a “guest bedroom” for the first few months so future grandparents wouldn’t get their hopes and expectations up. I found out I was pregnant about four months into the renovation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted a clean, modern, and bright space. I grew up in a house with white walls and dreamed of the day I would have my own place with HGTV-inspired fun accent walls and bold colors. Yet somehow we ended up with white walls, which probably means I’m turning into my parents. The best money we spent was on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof windows and soundproof walls.</a> We used to be able to hear everything happening outside on the street, and the lack of noise transformed the space. Now, when we’re eavesdropping on people’s conversations outside, it’s on purpose.</p>

<p>The kitchen is beyond our wildest dreams of anything we ever expected to have in New York City. We wanted it to be completely uncluttered, so we built spaces in the cabinets for the microwave, dishwasher, and trash. The gigantic kitchen sink brings me joy on a daily basis. Originally, we were thinking a medium-sized sink, but our contractor pushed us to consider something bigger, and we’re glad we did. The sink has all sorts of inserts—a cutting board, colander, tub, drying racks, and Murphy bed (just kidding about the last one) so it becomes any type of prep-surface we need.</p>

<p>We took advantage of an awkward corner to install a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in breakfast nook</a>. It’s become our go-to place for eating meals and working. Plus, it’s a natural gathering place and a cozy use of an oddly-shaped space. For the pantry, we used an Elfa system to create a miniature sewing room with a designated desk and outlet in there for my sewing machine.</p>

<p>The ice and water dispenser on the door of our refrigerator also has an outsized impact on our daily lives. After wasting years of our precious youth waiting for water to drip through a Brita filter, it feels like a miracle to have ice and cold water tumble effortlessly into a glass.</p>

<p>Both bathrooms stayed in place, though the one in the original apartment became our master bathroom adjacent to our new bedroom. My parents are updating their own house to be “aging-in-place” so we decided to put a walk-in shower instead of a tub in the guest bath, and used door levers instead of knobs throughout the apartment. We also installed hand showers in both spaces.</p>
<p>An image on Pinterest inspired the walls of hexagon tiles in our guest bathroom.  I loved how the classic shape was being used in an unexpected way. As someone who hates to scrub grout, using dark tile and gray grout in the shower seemed like a win-win for laziness and classiness.</p>

<p>In our new master bedroom (formerly our original living room), we wanted to maximize the minimal natural light. I read that light colors can make a dim room seem smaller, so we decided to paint the walls and ceilings a rich navy. That, combined with the blackout shades, makes for a very cozy sleeping environment. Along with the kitchen lights, the master bedroom lighting is voice-controlled. Having smart lights started out as a novelty, but became so useful once we had a baby to carry around. We may not have a flying car, but lying in bed and telling a robot to turn off the bedroom lights is our version of living in the future.</p>

<p>Our former bedroom is now the guest room and nursery. The neutral color palette, mixed with fun prints on the walls, makes it the perfect space for both. An architect friend suggested barn doors for the office to let more natural light into the whole apartment too.</p>
<p>We’ve watched enough home improvement shows to know that the unexpected is to be expected. Sure enough, we discovered pipes in a wall that needed to be re-routed and had to change our plans for the guest bathroom toilet when we found a floor beam in the way of our plumbing. With each surprise, our contractor kept us updated and came up with workable solutions. He was very upfront about what our options were and what the changes to our original scope of work would cost.</p>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor has a really good eye for design, and anytime we were in doubt about a decision, we followed his advice. From the soundproof windows and tile selections to the kitchen counters and a square toilet (surprisingly comfortable!), he never steered us wrong. We also appreciated how our contractor kept us updated; he set up a WhatsApp group chat which allowed us to easily communicate throughout the whole project, and we had weekly meetings face-to-face.</p>
<p>Having started this project as a couple and finishing it with a baby in tow, we can say that it’s faster (and cheaper) to create a human life than to renovate an apartment. That said, keeping our eye on the end goal—creating a home we love for us and our baby—made it all worth it. There is a story and memory behind every material and decision we made. We feel so lucky to live in a space we created for our family.</p>
<p><em>We hope you love your new home, Megan and Zack!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Proper bedroom walls finally go up in a family home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33300 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls06-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Located in the heart of downtown Brooklyn, the 808-square-foot apartment&#8217;s open layout, high ceilings, and a southeast-facing wall of windows were the main attractions for Sophie, a freelance translator and stay-at-home mom, and Michael, operations manager at Bureau van Dijk. After living there for four years, the couple really wanted to create a defined space for their 2-year-old son, Zacharia, and a baby girl soon to arrive in May, that the siblings could claim as their own. As part of the remodel, they wanted to carve out a peaceful space for themselves to relax as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The building, an eight-story concrete structure that was once a toy factory, was converted to 56 condos around 2005. The couple loved the industrial look of the apartment, especially the big concrete column, and high ceilings with exposed HVAC metal vent. However, the divider wall that split the loft layout into what Sophie said was “kinda two bedrooms,” didn’t go up to the ceiling and had no doors, so there was no sound isolation or privacy. Also, she said, “the second bedroom was really tiny and didn&#8217;t have much light coming through.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With clear goals in mind, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33301 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before01-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33303 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls-Before03-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33304 mb-0 size-chrono" title="red-winged-chair-living-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg" alt="red winged chair in living room with panelled window and brown floor after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new wall would help them shape the modern and industrial look that complemented the building. Since this project was about defining living spaces, it focused on function over style, although, Sophie said, “the resulting look of the space was important to us, and we tried making conscious design choices to match our style.” They chose hardware with linear shapes while traditional base moldings were replaced with straight profiles, along with trim around the door frames.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and a children&#8217;s bedroom in NYC, the bedroom wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To increase the size of the kids’ bedroom and keep enough space for their own bedroom, Sophie and Michael tested various configurations for every feature they wanted using 3-D renderings from the software program Sketch Up. Their decision-making process was guided by such questions as: “How far should they extend the bedrooms?”, “Would the kids’ room allow them to grow with a bunk bed?”, “How much natural light would reach the space?”, and “How high/big should the transom window be?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 mb-0 size-chrono" title="gray-walled-living-room-blue-bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01.gif" alt="gray walled living room with view of blue bedroom and nursery after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We had a fair amount of square footage in the hall entrance, which was not well-used,” Sophie said. “If asked to prioritize between an entrance hall and a children&#8217;s bedroom in New York City, the bedroom wins. The presence of a sprinkler limited us, but we were able to take two feet [width-wise].” And now, two strollers can still fit in the hallway. “It’s a win-win,” Sophie said. Extending one extra foot lengthwise helped to accommodate more furniture for the kids while leaving sufficient space in the dining area. “For the master, we decided not to extend it by that same one foot because it would have brought the wall to the middle of the windows, reducing our living room too much and affecting the amount of natural light coming through,” she explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33307 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33306 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls05-723x482.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While they had some initial concerns that the bump-out would break the flow of the apartment, “it actually helped create a better flow and even defined a separation between our living room area and our dining room area since there’s a virtual line where the wall comes forward. And the kids’ bedroom is now a usable and decent-sized room.” Their Sweeten contractor also found a solution to connect the HVAC vent to the rooms and keep them flush with the walls rather than extending outward into the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To preserve as much natural light as possible the living space and bedrooms, they designed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transom</a> between the two bedrooms and opted for pocket doors. “We wanted the kids to have a French door,” Sophie said, but they would have swung too widely into the apartment and taken up too much space. The soft-close <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pocket doors</a> were painted a darker stain to contrast against lighter walls. It was also a departure from the red tone found in their wood floors—which they weren’t fans of. “That will be yet another project,” she noted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every renovation comes with a little stress. In this case, since the whole family had no sleeping quarters for a while, they moved to an Airbnb for about two weeks. “That didn’t leave much flexibility in the timeline for unexpected surprises,” Sophie said. “Fortunately, our contractor stuck to the deadline with just a little bit of delay, but it was still manageable.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33309 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls04-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33308 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls03-723x1085.jpg" alt="open-plan layout renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They felt it was great to have Sweeten&#8217;s assistance from the start, giving them more confidence than just randomly searching the Internet on their own. “The process to schedule appointments with the contractors was fast and efficient,” Sophie said. “Knowing that we could contact one specific person at Sweeten&#8217;s client services if an issue arose compared to just having a generic email address is reassuring.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before a renovation, “you think you&#8217;ve covered your bases, but there are so many details, it’s sometimes hard not to get overwhelmed,” Sophie said. Choosing paint colors was one of the things that became maddening. It’s one thing to see it on paper or in 3-D on the computer, but “you&#8217;re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. Admittedly obsessed with finding the right shade, she explained, “We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I&#8217;d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple is “extremely happy with how the kids’ bedroom turned out,” Sophie said. Now that the renovation is finished, and the nursery has doors to close, Zacharia has a quiet place to rest during nap time and at night. And, said Sophie, “having defined spaces makes it a lot easier to keep our apartment feel put together.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once home to Nora Ephron, John Lennon, and countless other writers, artists, and musicians, the Upper West Side boasts a lively history that’s been captured in a myriad of films and immortalized in books. Broadway runs through it, and landmarks like the Apthorp, the Dakota, and Lincoln Center lend their impressive architecture to the texture of the neighborhood. The brownstone-lined blocks are quiet in the early mornings and evenings, making it an ideal spot for city dwellers seeking solitude. Join us as we take a look at some of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> renovations in the neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Empty nesters return home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side.jpg" alt="apartment remodel on Upper West Side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58112 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob relocated back to Manhattan</a> after working in the Midwest and South for some time. They found an apartment on the Upper West Side that satisfied their desire for pre-war architectural details. However, living with modern amenities meant updating the electrical wiring which was not expected, but had to be done. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adding a washer/dryer</a> and a dedicated home office space were top of their list. After living in the suburbs with easy access to laundry units, they never wanted to be without them in Manhattan again. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen was overhauled</a> and they loved ditching the bathtub for a large shower stall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they had past renovation knowledge, every experience had its unexpected nuances. They felt relieved to have Sweeten as the backstop when needed.</span></p>
<h3>The right fit with small-space appliances</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="kitchen on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58113" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Sweeten homeowner made it clear in her posting that an electrical upgrade would be <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-90-square-foot-manhattan-kitchen-revives-in-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required for her project</a>. To put the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen plan into action</a>, she hired a woman-owned contracting firm through Sweeten. The plan included replacing the electrical box and addressing plumbing issues before installing a new sink and faucet. Another top focus was purchasing small-sized appliances such as an 18&#8243; dishwasher, a 24&#8243; fridge, and a 20&#8243; range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner appreciated the way her <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor worked with her</a> during the remodel; it was a solution-based approach. When they ran into budget issues, the contractor offered alternative solutions that proved just as effective. Constant communication was highlighted as the reason for her smooth renovation. Similarly, we also checked in periodically with the homeowner. While no issues arose with the contractor, the homeowner found comfort in having us available to step in, if needed.</span></p>
<h3>A penthouse overhaul</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp" alt="Penthouse remodel on the Upper West Side" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Film director and novelist <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan Eliasberg made the decision</a> to purchase a penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side. Few were willing to undertake the dual challenge of acquiring a property and renovating it in the third month of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1,750-square-foot apartment presented numerous challenges, including roof leaks, asbestos-laced glue under the linoleum, mold, and a perplexing layout. With the help of her Sweeten contractor and a designer, they strategically modified the apartment, creating a seamless flow that emphasized the elegance of the tall ceilings and original windows. While addressing code violations, asbestos hazards, and water damage, the contractor&#8217;s professionalism and expertise proved invaluable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping within the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parameters of the co-op&#8217;s remodeling budget</a>, Jan successfully completed her project despite unforeseen obstacles, including Jan being the first homeowner to have central air installed in her apartment in the building’s history.</span></p>
<h3>A small bathroom remodeling success</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="black bathroom on the upper west side with walk in shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veronica&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a> was always on the to-do list, but it felt overwhelming and expensive. However, things took a turn when she received a complaint from her downstairs neighbors about a leak from her tub. This incident prompted Veronica to take on the challenge of renovating the entire bathroom. She met with several Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors who did work on the Upper West Side</a> and chose the right one to partner with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her favorite additions was the walk-in shower, which not only made the space feel more open but also gave it a modern touch. She further improved the room&#8217;s aesthetics by opting for a wall-mounted sink instead of an 18-inch vanity, which wouldn’t have stored much anyway. Although she initially planned to install a wall-mounted toilet, it didn’t fit the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/">bathroom remodeling budget nor the permit costs</a> it would require.</span></p>
<h3>Vital communication skills</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="apartment remodel on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58115" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tijesh, an experienced renovator, discovered his 750-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/upper-west-side-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> to find a GC. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin his apartment remodel</a>, his list of &#8220;must-haves&#8221; included installing Brazilian hardwood flooring, revamping the electrical system and three closets, and modernizing both the kitchen and bathroom. For example, a peninsula connected the newly-opened kitchen to the dining room space.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan for the bathroom upgrade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved challenging with no ability to rearrange the plumbing. Therefore, the solution was a rip-and-replace with streamlined fixtures and a glass-enclosed walk-in shower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were some unexpected hiccups and delays during the remodel but his Sweeten contractor kept the project moving along. He even sent progress photos when Tijesh was away. He appreciated his contractor’s communication style and reliable expertise.</span></p>
<h3>Built-ins organize a home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-32574 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />As an Upper West Sider, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a> guided her apartment search by one very important piece of criteria: the new place could be no more than 10 blocks from Zabar’s! Unfortunately, the right location came with outdated finishes and peeling paint. She hired a Sweeten contractor who helped Christine renovate the kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build custom built-in cabinets</a> in every room. The shelves stored her massive collection of books and artwork, adding character to the space.</p>
<h3>Open flow brings in the light</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58117 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bigger home was just what <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon</a> needed when they decided to grow their family. The apartment they found on the Upper West Side had been laid out like a rabbit warren. Although the latest arrival to their family was tiny, the space would have to fit the three of them comfortably for years to come. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remodeling budget for the kitchen</a> facilitated the removal of the walls and connected it to both the living and dining rooms on either side. There was now plenty of room for the family plenty to spread out. The decision for an open-plan also came with the added bonus of improving the flow of natural light throughout the space.</p>
<h3>A new floorplan makes the difference</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-23151 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsay and Tim</a> landed on Central Park West when it came time to purchase their first home together. The apartment had plenty of square footage, but the rooms felt dark and cramped. They planned on <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring the co-op layout</a> to join the kitchen with the dining room. This created the perfect spot to host dinner parties, while classic finishes and a muted palette throughout paid homage to the apartment&#8217;s prewar roots.</p>
<h3>A new layout welcomes a nursery</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Contemporary white and black bathroom" width="1600" height="1105" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x207.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-600x414.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing for a baby meant shuffling the floorplan of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karen and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Upper West Side apartment to fit a nursery and a kid-friendly bathroom. The small dining area at the end of the kitchen was sealed off and transformed into the baby&#8217;s room. Additionally, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom needed a refresh</a>. The grimy tiling was replaced with crisp white subway tile while the bulky bath was swapped out for a new, standard-sized tub. As a result, this made room for an open console vanity and a basket of bathtime essentials.</p>

The transformation was just what she needed to take the space from just another place in the world to her home sweet home.</p>

			<h2>Expecting parents take on a 3-story, daunting Sunset Park renovation</h2>
<p><em>For a decade, AJ and Ray lived in a 450-square-foot studio apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. In search of more space, they traveled a few stops south on the subway and landed a 3-floor, 2-family brick row house just across the street from the neighborhood&#8217;s park, offering views of New York Harbor and Manhattan. The home measured a whopping 2,964 square feet—not an unusual size for a townhouse, but much larger than what they were used to. After three years of test-driving their new space, they opened up rooms and improved the flow from front to back</em><em>&#8230;</em><em>while expecting a baby. Here&#8217;s how AJ and Ray used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to do a gut renovation in Sunset Park and turn a nondescript house into an open oasis for their family of three.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31408 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-10-723x482.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
Guest post by Sunset Park homeowner Ray</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We bought the house to renovate but lived in it for three years as we planned for the renovation. The place had been poorly maintained as a rental for many years (drop ceilings, temporary walls, very old roof, the works). It needed to be updated and modernized. The property was set up as a two-story, two-family house. There was an apartment on each floor—one bath, one bedroom, a kitchen and a living room. New kitchens and bathrooms don’t come cheap, and the renovation seemed daunting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We had lived in a small studio and were used to an open floor plan. When we moved into the new house, it was small and blocked off from all of the other rooms. It made it difficult to chat and hang out with each other. We weren&#8217;t used to the feeling of being separated. Figuring out the best layout, style, and finishes were left to AJ and Robin Rathmann-Noonan, her sister and an interior designer at <a href="https://www.robinr-n.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RobinR-N</a>. We were interested in an open entertaining space on the first floor with three bedrooms on the second floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were hoping that our renovation would be fast and straightforward. It was certainly not straightforward! Although the interior was designed and planned by Robin, we had to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire an architect</a> and expeditor to draw and file the plans. We interviewed at least eight contractors, but the one we initially selected, and who filed the plans with the city, had underbid and sent us a contract that was overpriced. After going back and forth, we ultimately abandoned him and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our design-build firm on Sweeten</a> after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7877" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posting our project</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Robin and AJ worked together to create a cohesive aesthetic for the house. In the kitchen, they looked to capture the light streaming through the back windows, and keeping the space as light and fresh as possible. &#8220;With the beautiful southern light at the back of the house and the openness of the view to the backyard, it made sense to relocate the kitchen there and open the rest of the house up to that space,” said Robin.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31423 size-chrono" title="stairwell" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-32-723x1085.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31422 size-chrono" title="door-at-entrance-inside-outside" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-31.gif" alt="door at the entrance from inside and outside after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />

On mini-splits: Ray had a hard time saying goodbye to the NYC radiators he had spent his entire life around. It was always too cold or too hot—and he LOVED it, says AJ.
</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry hall corridor leads directly to the kitchen. The lightness of the kitchen helped connect the spaces visually from the front to the back of the home. &#8220;The dark floors and kitchen table and chairs made a nice contrast to white cabinets and the light Caesarstone countertops,&#8221; says Robin. The kitchen island was a main feature of the space. From a recommendation from AJ and Robin’s mom, it housed the sink and an open built-in shelving area at one end for cookbooks and some baby items, making use of every inch of space!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“The space was designed to accommodate the way they live,&#8221; explained Robin. &#8220;If someone is cooking or the baby is playing, the family and guests can congregate on the ground floor and still feel connected even if they are in different rooms.” For lighting, they kept the ceilings minimalist, choosing surface-mount fixtures and pendants as a design focus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of layout, we had two options for a third bedroom: it could go in the front of the house with a window, or in between the two other bedrooms where it currently sits. After working on the drawings, Robin determined that we could get more space using the space adjacent to the front bedroom than the space that is now a bathroom. According to the Department of Buildings code, we needed light and an egress to make sure that it could be called a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal bedroom</a>. In order to accomplish this, we needed to put a skylight into the middle bedroom as part of the roof update. It seemed odd at the time, but in the end, the room ended up being perfect for the baby, who we were already expecting when the renovation began.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31573 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-During-2-723x482.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, although we wanted air conditioning in the house, central air was a huge financial commitment. Mini-splits were suggested, but our past landlords had put a unit in our old apartment near the end of our time there, which we liked functionally but not aesthetically. After much back and forth, we decided on a ducted mini-split system so that the air-handling units were hidden in the ceilings; we only lost a little height in the first-floor hallway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31432 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-19-723x482.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31434 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was an enormous undertaking for us, and as much of a rush that we were in with a baby on the way, we appreciated that our Sweeten contractor slowed us down and walked through the entire process with us, down to the details of the toilet paper holder. Our renovation was a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design-build</a> job and our Sweeten contractor had all the details of what needed to be done written down on paper for our review. We appreciated the attention to detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best advice we can give is to ask questions even when things get technical and you are in over your head. And be patient! Our main questions were: Can we afford this? What is the payment schedule? Can we finish the house before the baby arrives? What is your timeline?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were most excited about having space, a real kitchen and closets, which was a huge change from where we were living before. When we worked on the interior layout, it seemed like we had planned for an extreme amount of storage space, but wouldn’t you know, we’ve managed to use it all!</p>
<p>We are so glad that we found our Sweeten contractor—we couldn’t have been happier (or luckier!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Tara and Ryan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29286 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah and her husband bought their first apartment last year in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. It was originally a one-bedroom co-op, but they benefitted from some renovations the previous owners had done, including cordoning off space for a second bedroom. Architectural details such as an ornate archway were also intact, giving it the perfect amount of charm. On the other hand, the bathroom needed some work, as did the hodgepodge of cabinets in the kitchen. With two small kids, Sarah also saw a peace-giving opportunity to swap out flimsy doors on the second bedroom for something with a little more soundproofing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though they closed on the apartment in November, Sarah and her husband rented the apartment back to the former owners during the planning stages of the renovation. By the time the building’s board approved the plans, “we ended up with just five weeks to get the work done, including over Christmas and New Years,” said Sarah. They were moving in February 1. With the holiday season in full swing, they had trouble finding a contractor up for the tight timeframe challenge. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah came to Sweeten</a>, a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free service that connects homeowners</a> with vetted general contractors, to find someone for the job. “It came down to the wire,” said Sarah. “<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Sweeten contractor</a> and team were still painting as we were moving in.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as kitchens go, the kitchen in the apartment wasn’t half bad. It had an open plan that fed into the living room, wooden countertops, and a farmhouse-style sink. However, cream backsplash tiles that culminated in a heavy printed pattern above the sink weighed the whole thing down. “The real goal in all of this was to make everything as clean and minimalistic as possible,” said Sarah. The mismatch of cabinets also needed to have one cohesive look. The couple went for open shelving to make the kitchen feel bigger. They also loved the idea of showing off their dishes. “They are really beautiful and we don’t mind looking at them all the time,” said Sarah. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> below the counter were from Ikea and were perfectly fine, but they had wanted to replace them with flat fronts for a minimalist aesthetic. However, for new homeowners, that was a few steps over the budget line. Instead, the hardware was swapped out for a bold gold. “It completely changed their look,” said Sarah. &#8220;We&#8217;re very happy with the result.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One archway in the kitchen was in the original Art Deco style (the building was built in 1938), so Sarah’s Sweeten contractor was asked to mirror the design on an adjacent archway—previously a doorframe. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t sure that was possible, but he did an amazing job!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom received the most extensive makeover of the project. The floors needed to be re-tiled with a new shower fixture and vanity added. “It never felt very clean,” said Sarah, of the existing bathroom, which had black floor tiles. “It&#8217;s a small space so we went with all white to make it feel as open as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the archways in the kitchen, Sarah wanted to keep some of the old detail. In the bathroom, that meant keeping the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub</a>. Its light salmon pink gives the bathroom an understated drop of color. It was also easier to let it remain where it was. &#8220;That&#8217;s a cast iron tub and it weighs a ton! We thought, just keep it and make everything else white.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom provided the couple a chance to add a nod to a favorite style, Shaker architecture. Instead of using typical towel rails, Sarah had a peg rail made by a Shaker workshop in Massachusetts. “It turns out to be really handy to have a lot of pegs,” she said. “We use them for towels and drying clothes for the baby.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28713 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog09-1.gif" alt="renovation Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest part of the renovation turned out to be not so. It turned out that the new doors for the nursery weren&#8217;t made to be as soundproof as they used to be. The couple’s Sweeten contractor suggested a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid core door</a> rather than one with MDF (medium-density fiberboard) cores, which can be pushovers when it comes to noise. However, “it turns out solid core is incredibly difficult to find these days,” said Sarah. She only found one option in an extensive search. It turned out to be the perfect fit. Well, almost. The floors were uneven. That meant the new doors needed to be sanded down for a snug fit. The couple also handmade some leather pulls instead of using door knobs. Now, Sarah and her husband are enjoying the fruits of their efforts. “Our girls snooze away while we watch movies or entertain right outside their door,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The priority was using paint that was as non-toxic as possible, a subject Sarah is very serious about, in light of research linking volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from certain objects and liquids, like paint, to cancer. While some fancier brands had whites the couple liked, they decided to keep their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a> in mind and went with something more economical that was also VOC-free. That turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint,” said Sarah, “and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this project, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-week timeline</a> wasn’t the only thing that was tight. Sarah and her husband were focused on sticking to their budget. The couple worked closely with their Sweeten contractor to keep costs low in other areas, such as picking up some materials and supplies themselves. It turned out to be a lot of work, including a run out to New Jersey to get tiles, paint, and grout. However, the strategy had a valuable fringe benefit. “It made us very involved in the project,” said Sarah. “We made every decision along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A couple reconfigures their living space for a new family addition</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Idalee, Danny, and baby" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-01-723x526.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="526" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When work started, Idalee, 25 weeks pregnant, and her husband, Danny, had a natural deadline to turn their one-bedroom apartment into two bedrooms. Previously, the couple, along with their dog Maxie, squeezed into a studio for four years to save for their first home purchase. They found themselves leaning towards co-op buildings in Clinton Hill, which provided larger living spaces as well as more modern features (at least more modern than a prewar apartment). “We fell in love with the neighborhood and the flexibility the spaces had with converting the apartments,” said Daniel. That was in 2015. Since then they have been planning their renovation as well as starting a family.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27588 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-FLOORPLAN-before-723x482.jpg" alt="before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27874 size-chrono" title="new floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_New_Floor_Plan_Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="new floor plan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a>The goal of the renovation was to simultaneously create a nursery from a small dining space off the living room while opening up the apartment to be more conducive to entertaining, as well as fix water-damaged floors. They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor from Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted contractors. “We wanted to optimize the small square footage of the space and ideally achieve unobstructed sightlines throughout,” said Daniel. The couple was intent on incorporating a mid-century look in the decor and furniture. Above all, they needed to do all this within their budget and in time for the baby’s arrival. They were fortunate enough to live with family nearby, “but we can’t imagine what things would have been like if we had to live in the space during the renovation,” said Daniel. The close proximity allowed them to check in on the progress of their renovation about once a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/brooklyn-couple-adds-nursery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was the biggest part of the renovation. In the original design, a cupboard stood between the kitchen and the living space. As glorious as storage is in an apartment, it had to be sacrificed in order to connect the kitchen to the living room. Luckily, there was dead space near the front door entryway and the couple’s Sweeten contractor was able to carve out a storage closet. Huge drawers in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a>, as well as cabinets that went to the ceiling, also made up for lost storage. And of course, “a little <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/marie-kondo-closet-organizing-cleaning-konmari-spark-joy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Kondo</a>-style purging” helped limit what actually needed to be stored.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing kitchen aesthetic was bland with pine cabinets and a sad beige countertop. For the new look, Daniel and Idalee went for a modern and industrial design that would blend with the more mid-century look of the living room in a color mix of white and grays. This was reflected in the kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tiles</a>, where the couple had a bit of fun. “I would say that our kitchen floors are one of our favorite aspects,” said Daniel, ”since we didn’t think we would be able to accomplish a mosaic tile floor with our budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an added bonus, the Sweeten contractor found a hidden power outlet near the kitchen window. “My husband does a lot of cooking and having an outlet allows us to use a fan to help regulate the temperature in the apartment,” said Idalee. Their contractor also helped the duo decide where new power sources should go, especially since walls and outlets were removed during the renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-before1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27578 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-before1-723x482.jpg" alt="before" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Before) The dining space converted into the nursery, and the living room wall on the left came down.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27576 mt-24 size-chrono" title="entry to nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-13-723x1085.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27575 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-11-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27574 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-10-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27573 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-09-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27572 mb-0 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Idalee_Kitchen_Nursery-08-723x482.jpg" alt="second bedroom nursery" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Daniel and Idalee worked with their architect Robert to place the walls and convert the dining room into a nursery. They opted for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass doors</a> to let the maximum amount of light into the living room. The glass also meant that they could keep an eye on their newborn child from the next room. “When he gets older, we will put a curtain on the inside of the door that he can control and can ideally still let light through during the day,” said Idalee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area near the front door with the new storage closet also needed a railing because of the lowered entryway. &#8220;We always knew we needed to add one when we had a child, so we included this as part of our renovation,&#8221; said Idalee. &#8220;The railing works great to section off the side of the stairs.&#8221; They also added a small white bench under the railing as a sitting area for putting shoes on and off. &#8220;It feels like a small mud room to us, which is nice to have in a small city apartment,&#8221; she said. </p>

<p>  Water damage to the original parquet floors needed to be fixed. With a little bit of luck, a neighbor who was also renovating was able to donate some old flooring to replace the damaged section. However, matching the rest of the older floor while patching up the problem area would be near impossible. Instead, the couple decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the floors and change the shade from a golden oak to a dark walnut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To find their stellar Sweeten contractor, Daniel and Idalee had some help from Sweeten Client Services; their advisor also offered to join phone calls with the couple and potential contractors. “We really can’t say enough about how great it was using the Sweeten service,” said Daniel. “Sweeten is certainly a fan favorite among the Clinton Hill co-ops.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though their renovation ran on time and within budget, it certainly was “nothing like you see on HGTV,” said Daniel. The one piece of advice the couple would give to those embarking on a renovation is simple: plan properly and start early.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Plans include an open kitchen, new closets, oak floors, and embracing the “cons” of Carrara marble</h2>
<p><i>A search for a home to suit their growing family led Marissa and Cody from the West Village to a beautiful spot in northern Manhattan. The apartment, a two-bed, one-bath corner unit, was located on a steep hill in the neighborhood of Hudson Heights. (Fun fact: the building’s foundation sits on a lattice of 40-foot steel stilts!) It came with soaring views of the city, gorgeous light from its north- and east-facing windows, and felt “more like San Francisco than New York City.” The unit’s interior needed some updating, and Cody, an architect, was up to the task. </i><span class="s1"><i>Paired up with a contractor from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors,</i></span><span class="s1"><i> they </i></span><i>knocked down a wall closing in the galley kitchen to connect it to the living room<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>creating an open kitchen design<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>removed a nib wall, and made changes to the bath as well as the floors and closets throughout.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cody says</span>: </i></span>We had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for seven years. We started looking to buy an apartment when Marissa became pregnant, and homed in on northern Manhattan to give her a reasonable commute to Columbia University (we had ruled out several neighborhoods in Brooklyn for this reason). Our first impression of Hudson Heights was that it felt like a small village tucked away in the city, surrounded by amazing views and parks. We visited on a snowy winter day, and saw a cross-country skier in the middle of the street!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We continued to look more seriously after our daughter, Lucia, was born, and finally closed on an apartment in March 2016: a two-bed, one-bath, 1,000-square-foot apartment in a 1960s co-op building. Though the postwar construction did not have some of the Art Deco, prewar detailing that is typical of the neighborhood, it did lend itself to a simple and logical floor plan and had thru-wall air conditioning units<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>allowing in even more light than apartments we saw with window units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marissa says</span>:</i></span> Cody is an architect, and we wanted something we could renovate and make our own. While continuing to live in our West Village apartment, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> to Sweeten and went with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> who was professional, communicative, and direct. The renovation took eight weeks (two weeks under the projected schedule the contractor proposed!), and we moved in just after he finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of our overall vision, first and foremost we wanted to join the kitchen to the living space. We hoped to make the apartment feel open, light, and modern, but warm and homey at the same time. We were drawn to a clean and minimal palette, especially in the kitchen. Cody is an avid home cook, and we knew the kitchen would be the heart of the home. We maximized where we could—for example, with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36-inch wide refrigerator</a>, five-burner range, 23-inch stainless steel undermount sink. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot island</a> is our home base, the place where we naturally gravitate throughout the day or when we have friends over.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26378 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shelves for cookbooks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related note, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA kitchen</a> cabinet system is amazing for the price point. There are an infinite number of modular configurations and we achieved a result that is nearly indistinguishable from a custom kitchen. The upper cabinets are 40 inches tall and extend to the ceiling, allowing for tons of storage (we never thought we would have empty shelves while living in NYC!). It was important for us to use “real” materials like stone and wood to accent specific moments. For example, we selected the white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> knowing full well it would take a beating. We loved the idea that every scratch, etch, and stain will continue to give it character over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="view from the kitchen into the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that an open kitchen design and living area was our primary goal, the first question we asked ourselves when viewing a potential apartment was: “Can we connect the kitchen to the living space?” The existing kitchen in our apartment was a long and narrow galley. Knocking down the wall allowed us to redesign the entire room, maximizing storage and functionality while linking the main living spaces. It also made the room much brighter<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the window in the kitchen brings in tons more light to the living and dining room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedrooms, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a> the floors with a lighter and more natural oak. We love how they seem to brighten up both spaces now. We also redid the closets in both rooms; in the master bedroom we were able to do the floor-to-ceiling pivot hinges, just like in the living space, but in Lucia&#8217;s room a beam prevented us from doing the same. We were still able to reframe her closet and maximize storage with a new shelving system. We also bought very minimal ceiling light fixtures for each room, which blend in while providing extra ambient light. All of that, plus the square-stock baseboards and door casings, really spruced up both rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26362 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26363 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26364 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also eliminated a small nib wall in the living room that separated the front living space from the bedrooms in the back of the apartment. With the nib wall gone, there is a direct line of sight to the windows in Lucia’s bedroom, which brightens the entire apartment and creates a feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26367 size-chrono" title="office nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 mb-0 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of the kitchen and living room project, we also saw the opportunity to reframe the closets throughout the apartment, remove the existing sliding bypass closet doors, and replace them with floor-to-ceiling pivot hinged doors. This created ample storage, and the verticality of the doors and their accompanying hardware became a design feature consistent in every room. The reconfiguration that resulted in an open kitchen design also allowed us to create a new hallway linen closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made a few changes to the bathroom which made a big difference in the final look. We replaced the pedestal sink for a wall mounted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> which created a lot more storage, replaced the old shower bypass glass doors with a fixed glass panel, and gave it a fresh coat of gray paint. We kept the tiles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting fixtures,</a> and towel racks from the previous design.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26370 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26371 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most surprising moment of the whole process was when our contractor sent us some photos after the first day of demolition. There was a huge pile of debris in the middle of the apartment, and a raw opening between the kitchen and living room and around each closet. Beams, columns, electrical conduit, and wiring were totally exposed. It was a shock to realize how much work we were really putting into the renovation. There was no turning back, and we could only hope that all the planning and design preparation going into the project would work out. Eight weeks later, it was a finished project and we could not have been happier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can’t recommend our Sweeten contractor enough. Although his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid</a> was slightly higher than the others we received, we immediately got the sense that he would deliver a high-quality product, not exceed his budget, and stick to his schedule. All of this turned out to be accurate. We felt most comfortable with him from day one. He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that there are many unknowns in the renovation process, and many pieces that are out of your control. Until we knocked down the wall between the living room and kitchen, we did not know for certain what would be behind it. (We had done a small probe to look for pipes, and based on the short span, we assumed that there were not any structural elements.) We couldn’t know for sure the location of the plumbing and gas risers until demolition was complete, which would ultimately dictate where we placed the kitchen sink and oven. It turned out that the gas riser was floating off the perimeter wall by almost 24 inches, and we had initially assumed it would be right along the perimeter wall. As a result, the opening to the kitchen had to be cut short. Although it was initially a disappointment, we used the 24-inch wall as an opportunity to put in a small cabinet and countertop, with wooden shelves above. It ended up being a great addition to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open kitchen design</a>, even though we hadn’t anticipated it!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our advice to future renovators: make your design choices ahead of time and stick to them. You don’t want to be redesigning in the middle of construction. If there are any surprises during construction (like the location of a gas riser<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>see above), it is critical to make a thoughtful yet quick decision and keep moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with the apartment. It turned out just as we had envisioned it, and it’s been great to have so much space! We had been living in a 600-square-foot one-bedroom for Lucia’s first year, and by the time we moved out, we were feeling very cramped. Now, we’re expecting our second baby, and it feels like there is plenty of room to grow. But if the day comes when we do need more space and we start looking for our next renovation project, we’ll certainly use Sweeten again!</p>
<p><i>What a thoughtful and beautiful redesign, Cody! Thanks to you, Marissa, and Lucia for a glimpse into your home. </i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Light or dark, wide-plank flooring is a smart investment that provides lasting style</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like a pair of jeans, wide-plank flooring is a classic design that comes in a variety of materials and finishes and can adapt to any <span style="color: #000000;">decor</span>. It works in every room of your home as a dependable canvas for the rest of your design choices and furnishings. This width comes in engineered and hardwood styles, both of which are high-quality and long-lasting. If you’re thinking about a cost-effective option, engineered is the way to go. However, if you really want <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardwood</a>, go for it! Don’t be discouraged by daily wear and tear. Like those jeans we talked about earlier, hardwood only gets better with age. Below, five Sweeten homeowners use wide-plank flooring to complete the look of their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25922 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MeganClintonApt-13-723x1095.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1095" /></a>A hallway in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill home</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Clinton Hill couple replaced orange-hued parquet with matte wide-plank flooring to set the tone of their home, outfitting their main hallway, kitchen, and combined dining and living spaces with it. They chose a high-grade engineered wood in a pale shade that counterbalances the white walls.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25923 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-723x469.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="469" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-austins-williamsburg-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin’s bedroom</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin’s pale shade of matte flooring looks familiar, but unlike the Clinton Hill couple, his bedroom floor is made of hardwood. The feeling is fresh and simple and contributes to his home’s sense of serenity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25924 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ron’s apartment, dark, wide-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a>, fully waterproofed, adds richness to an all-white kitchen. The engineered wood planks continue throughout the living and dining spaces, providing a touch of drama within the home’s otherwise neutral palette of sand and beige tones<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25925 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_ClaudiaNursery-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="wide plank flooring" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/claudia-and-alejandros-boerum-hill-condo-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia and Alejandro’s nursery</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claudia tore out the old, yellow tinted floors and installed a light oak floor in every room of her home, including the nursery. Paired with lightly colored walls, the look is soft and dreamy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25926 size-chrono" title="wide plank flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-723x468.jpg" alt="wide-plank flooring" width="723" height="468" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario and Joe’s kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another take on oak: Mario and Joe chose matte wide-plank flooring to modernize the appearance of their apartment. In the kitchen, layered rugs add color and texture.</p>

She gave us the tour of the kitchen and powder room on the upper parlor level. Now we&#8217;re back to view their bedrooms and master bath on the garden level. Here&#8217;s how the couple and their contractor transformed a level with lower ceilings and semi-subterranean location into a cozy and very chic space.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>, we decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> the dark wood floors throughout our duplex apartment to brighten the living space. It was especially needed in the bedrooms on the lower level. We ran into our first delay after work began on the floors. Initially, we selected a weathered oak finish, but our mistake was not testing it before moving forward. It wasn’t until after the entire lower level had been sanded and re-stained that we learned the red oak floors didn’t take the color as we had expected. To complicate things, we discovered the wood on the stairs was white oak, while the upper level floor was maple. The renovation timeline was delayed a week as we tested combinations of stains to find a neutralizing color that worked on all three wood types. Fletcher made the ultimate selection of Bona Grey, and we could not be happier with how it turned out!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The new floors immediately brightened the lower level of the duplex, which was key in disguising its semi-subterranean status. In addition to a lighter floor stain, we painted the bedroom walls with light colors—a cool gray in the baby&#8217;s nursery and a calming off-white in the master bedroom. White bedroom furniture, accents, and linens maintained the bright palette. To give the impression of larger windows, we added floor-to-ceiling sheer curtains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lower level had no base molding or traditional casing around the windows, and the interior doors styles were flat with concealed hinges, creating a sterile look. To introduce more character, we added base trim throughout the bedrooms and shaker-style panel doors. Our contractor helped us realize how cost-effective this strategy was. It was a low-cost improvement that made a huge impact. The garden level feels as comfortable and inviting as the upper living area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were already very pleased with the layout of the main bath, and found it was efficiently designed. Within a small space, it contained a tub—essential for our growing family—a large walk-in shower, and even a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a> that already existed! It may have been more convenient to have them in a room where we could fold laundry, but we were happy to not give up significant apartment real estate. We just avoid running the ventless dryer while taking a shower. The amount of moisture in the room can become overwhelming!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the powder room upstairs, we kept the original Duravit fixtures, and were conscious of choosing materials that would make the space feel larger and brighter. This was especially important because we decided to tear out the existing back-lit vanity mirror that spanned the entire length of the main bath wall. And it was actually effective in making the room feel larger but we replaced it with a more traditional vanity mirror and sconce lighting. We continued the marble mosaic into the shower to avoid visually dividing the space, and kept the walls bright with the same Nemo white 2&#215;8 subway tile used for the kitchen backsplash.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to our Sweeten contractor and his crew, the renovation process was relatively quick and painless. By having the design decisions completed before work began, we eliminated on-the-go decision-making and were able to work with the team and budget effectively. We were happy to have a contractor with a calm disposition, who was extremely sensitive to our schedule and accommodating to hiccups in the process.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;">Although the work moved quickly, it wasn’t completed on schedule due to minor delays. Working with a tight timeline, there was little room for contingency. Our scheduled move-in landed just a week before our baby’s due date. As luck would have it, I went into labor early, on moving day!<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because our kitchen cabinets had been delayed a few weeks, we returned from the hospital as they were being installed. We introduced our newborn to a home with appliances stacked in the living room and unpacked boxes occupying the rest of the apartment. We camped out as a family in the nursery (equipped with my college dorm mini-fridge) for a week while major work was being completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two weeks after our move and into parenthood, the renovation was 95% complete. We unpacked boxes while the baby slept. Talk about exhausting! Looking back, transitioning was certainly hectic, but we couldn’t be happier with our new home. It is the perfect environment for our growing family.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23278 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23279 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-17" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to maximize space at home: use transom windows, pocket doors, custom walls and more</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Open floor plans are all the rage—so much so that the first temptation of a renovating homeowner may be to tear down walls. But before you bring in the wrecking ball, consider if you&#8217;ll have enough personal space for your family (or frequent overnight guests), and how a strategically placed wall or partition can maximize your space at home while defining the private areas of your home. Take cues from these Sweeten homeowners and their clever uses of space, from carving out niches and capturing square footage in other areas to adding moveable partitions for smooth transitions.</span></p>

<h3>Transom windows allow for a guest bedroom to be added</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an L-shaped living room in their new apartment, Deeksha and Joe saw the opportunity to create a guest bedroom. All they needed to do was add a wall and a doorway. The only problem was that the placement of the wall would block the light and hide a gorgeous view from the corner windows. A unique solution—an interior wall of windows—provides the necessary privacy for the guest bedroom while still allowing the flow of light to reach the rest of the living room. The new space also serves as a light-filled workspace for the family.</p>

<h3>Custom sliding doors to help maximize a 500 square-foot home</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Claire and Dan purchased their 500-square-foot studio apartment, they knew it needed a renovation. The unit hadn’t been updated since the &#8217;60s, and the couple wanted to build out a junior one-bedroom by separating the living/kitchen area from the sleeping space. With DOB regulations preventing permanent wall additions, they worked with their architect and Sweeten general contractor to install custom sliding doors. With the sliding doors, they maximize their space at home by keeping the space open during the day, and closing them for privacy or while entertaining. </span></p>

<h3>Strategically removing a hallway adds space (and light!)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long hallway was the main culprit of wasted space in Walter and Laura’s Park Slope apartment. By removing their entry hallway, they imbued their apartment with more natural light</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and space. With the newly-provided footage, their kitchen swapped places with a spare bedroom and got an expanded, angular footprint in the foyer. A small dining/entertaining area was also added to the kitchen, allowing guests to visit with the couple while they cooked. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Adding a wall creates a new bedroom, while transom windows let in soft light</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The notion of adding a dishwasher to their kitchen escalated into a full gut renovation, and then took another, unexpected turn when Chris and Amber found out their second child was on the way. The project was now an opportunity to carve out a room for their older son. A wall was added to separate the dining nook from the rest of the kitchen, turning it into a bedroom, and a milk glass transom window was installed above the doorway to allow light to filter through. Finishing touches; a crib, picture shelves, roller blinds, and a colorful rug complete the transformation from dining nook to a growing boy&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<h3><strong>A studio morphs into a one-bedroom with the help of a full dividing wall</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New homeowner Paul landed his perfect apartment by getting creative in his search: instead of buying a “true” one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, he purchased a studio that was listed as a junior one bedroom. Paul noticed the apartment’s previous owner was already mimicking a one-bedroom layout by using a built-in bookcase to separate the bedroom and living area. He replicated this layout in his renovation by having this general contractor add a full dividing wall (with a pocket door) to separate his living area from his bedroom. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Turning a studio into a two-bedroom (yes, really!) with movable partitions </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frans and Dalal planned on making their studio function as a two-bedroom; not an easy feat, considering the apartment’s existing open-plan layout. They added a custom king-size platform bed in the space designated as the master bedroom. The key feature, movable partitions, allow it to work as a space for sleep or as another part of the home. For the &#8220;second bedroom,&#8221; a queen-size Murphy bed that folds up horizontally to save space and a closet were installed in the area designated as the living room, which uses the same sliding doors for privacy. As an added bonus, the wall unit that houses the pull-out bed and closet blends into the surrounding walls when the bed is tucked away.</p>

<h3><strong>Major wall movement reshapes an entire 700 square-foot apartment layout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn one bedroom into two, create a walk-in closet, and make a dining space fit for hosting: these items topped the to-do list for sisters (and roommates) Deanna and Daria’s renovation in New York’s Sutton Place. To really maximize space at their home, construction moved walls from the existing dining room, living room and bedroom to reshape the new rooms: nearly the entire space of the apartment. Now, their 700 square-foot apartment maximizes every inch of space while showcasing the sisters’ preference for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bold patterns and color. </span></p>

<h3><strong>To maximize space at home for a new baby, walls &amp; a doorway create a nursery </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to make their one-bedroom apartment family-ready, Karen and Kevin set their sights on converting a dining nook situated at the tail end of the kitchen into a nursery for their daughter. They added a new wall and doorway, which allows  for entry from the main living area. The new nursery, now completely separate from the kitchen, receives a flood of sunlight during the day, an added benefit from the window it inherited from the former dining area.</p>

<h3><strong>A retractable partition create privacy for parents and children in a one-bedroom</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A one-bedroom in a coveted neighborhood inspired Casey and Kumar to maximize space at home for their four-person family. After examining their family’s daily routines, the couple decided to give their sons the master bedroom so that they would have a space for playtime and bedtime. They added a multipurpose space in the living area with a wall of custom millwork and a pull-out bed. This became the space that Casey and Kumar could sleep and store their clothes. To preserve privacy and block light and noise, a retractable partition now divides the designated sleeping space from the rest of the home. The addition of the partition now offers flexibility for the family&#8217;s daily needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Need your one-bedroom to be a two-bedroom? Demo a closet, build a partition, add a door. Voila!</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way, Lindsay and Matt needed to turn their one-bedroom into a two-bedroom apartment. They planned to do this by splitting the existing bedroom into a master bedroom and nursery. A few key layout changes made this all possible: demolishing closets to gain back valuable square footage, building a partition, and creating a doorway that opened into the living room. These newly constructed spaces have allowed the home to reach its full potential by making room for the whole family.</p>
