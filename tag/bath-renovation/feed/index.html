										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An awkward space turns sanctuary with a few simple ideas</h2>
<p>When a long apartment search finally ended, Victoria’s Secret designer Christine Yao returned to one of the first listings already crossed off her list. It was the one she ultimately closed on, and she was happy with her new home—except for her bathroom which felt like showering in a dark closet. An internet search led her to Sweeten and a match with a general contractor, who would help transform the space to echo the layout and feel of the baths she&#8217;d been pinning on Pinterest for months. With smart space reconfigurations (including a vintage sliding door) and good project management, he made it happen. In her own words, Christine tells the story, from how the thought of renovating scared her to the completion of her relaxing new dwelling.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21669 size-large" title="fashion designer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg" alt="White bedroom" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-11-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><em>Guest post by East Village homeowner Christine Yao</em></p>
<p>I had been living on the Lower East Side for about five years when I started looking for a place to own. My weekends became a routine, waking up and planning errands around my StreetEasy open house schedule and any listings my real estate agent sent me. The beginning was packed, usually a few on Saturday and also Sundays when I walked all over downtown and viewed up to six apartments. You quickly realize that when you are focused on staying in a specific area—for me that was roughly LES/Chinatown/East Village—there are a limited number of places to see. At first, it seemed like there were hundreds of apartments for sale, and maybe 50 you can afford. You feel like half of the 50 may not even be worth seeing from the photos but you go see them anyway. A friend who had gone through the home-buying process made a comparison to online dating—one can only tell so much from the photos, you just have to go and see it in person to really know! A few months in, I had lost out on two places, and felt a little hopeless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a69f3d;"><em><strong>&#8220;No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?&#8221;</strong></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, finally, six months after I started looking, I had an accepted offer and closed on a co-op in the East Village. I had actually seen this apartment at the very beginnings of my search. My brother was in town on a Sunday when I dragged him from one open house to another. We thought the apartment was in an awesome location, and was a nice size. It needed some cosmetic work, but both agreed the bathroom was terrible. It had a wall right in the middle of it with the bathtub half concealed, so it felt like you were showering in a dark closet. It was cramped, with an awkward layout, and was just in bad shape. So I crossed it off the list. The idea of a bathroom renovation was overwhelming to me, on top of buying my first home. Then six months of searching made me re-think—maybe I could. No place is going to be everything you want it to be, so why not budget some remodeling in and make it what you want?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21673 size-large" title="bath renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-Before_During-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So now, I had a bathroom to renovate, a living space that needed a refresh, and no idea where to start. The internet brought me to Sweeten. I liked how simple and straightforward it made finding a contractor: you <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post your project</a> and general contractors are matched for your job. I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>—his work was most similar to the aesthetic I was going for and he had completed a project on Sweeten with a great review.</p>
<p>My plan for the entire apartment’s look was minimalist. I love a clean space that still feels warm and cozy. Greek cave hotels and Moroccan riads are a big inspiration for me. I did have a vision of wanting the apartment to feel like a vacation&#8230;somewhere tropical and feels relaxing when you are there. The kitchen, main living area, and two bedrooms just needed a redesign. But I couldn’t imagine my day-to-day in the previous bathroom—the door opening awkwardly, the dark shower, and not being able to enjoy a bath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-21714" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Christine_Bathroom-01-02 (1)" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>I was hoping the middle wall obstruction could be partially removed but we wouldn’t know if it was structural until the demo. Turns out the wall had all the building plumbing running through it, so needless to say, it had to stay. However, we found serious leaks happening on the floors above and below me (I am on the third floor of a five-story building), which the building would have to fix before we could move forward. Since pipes had to be replaced, the plumbing could be re-routed, allowing us to swap tub and toilet positioning. This worked out for the best: the toilet in a “nook,” and the bathtub by the window.</p>
<p>I had so many images on my desktop saved for ideas and realized they all had the common thread of black tile floors and clean, white walls with modern fixtures. I was getting a lot of inspiration from restaurant and hotel restrooms. I definitely wanted recessed lighting above the toilet (dimmers are a must for all lighting—mood!) and exposed plumbing under the sink for more leg room.</p>
<p>I ended up ordering almost everything on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>, which has phenomenal customer service by the way. I must have looked at hundreds of sinks. We realized it had to be a corner sink or you wouldn’t have enough space to get on and off the toilet. Then the toilet had to be an appropriate size. Measured twice, measure one more time, then cross my fingers when it came in. It all fit into this Tetris game of a bathroom! I wanted a sliding door that would let light through and found an old office door at Big Reuse in Gowanus, Brooklyn. My contractor cut it down to fit the doorway and painted it.</p>

<p>The renovation was running a couple months late due to waiting on permits, so taking things like a toilet and subway tile from Home Depot that were in stock was a priority. My Sweeten contractor was so easy to work with and made things stress-free on everything from dealing with the unexpected delays and permits to coordinating a time to receive a bathtub delivery. I also trusted his aesthetic and opinion on any design or materials questions I had.</p>
<p>As far as the rest of the apartment, it’s amazing what fresh paint and swapping out things like lighting, doorknobs, and some cabinet doors can do. He did a fantastic painting job and the white floors are my favorite feature of my home. My original budget was $25,000 for renovating the bathroom and repainting the apartment. I ended up going $4,500 overbudget because I live in a co-op. The process of getting permits and running into unforeseen issues with plumbing in-between the floors increased the costs and timeline. A six-week planned renovation turned into three months. I think it was really just me underestimating the cost of labor and materials, especially living here in New York City.</p>

<p>The bathroom turned out better than I could have hoped and I am so thankful for the successful renovation I had with my contractor through Sweeten. Now that I’ve experienced the process, the advice I can offer is to be prepared for it to take longer than you think. And add another month. Be prepared to spend a good chunk of time every day on it—coordinating with your contractor, arranging delivery times, looking for fixtures, going to check on things, etc. Be ready to laugh when things go wrong. And go wrong again. It’ll be worth it when you are enjoying your renovated place, I promise.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot about the kitchen—with all of my budget going to the bathroom and painting, I just took down the cabinet doors myself and painted. That’s a move I’ve done in many apartments I’ve lived in as a renter. It’s functional for now but I can’t wait to renovate this space next!</p>
<p>Thank you Christine, for sharing your story as a first-time homeowner and renovator! You proved that a few renovating ideas can make a big impact, and we love your fresh style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating for resale in Brooklyn: a kitchen and bath remodel enjoyed by current &amp; future homeowners</h2>
<h2><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather and Doug&#8217;s 1980s South Slope condo was in need of an update, but given the family’s eventual plans to move, they kept putting off a renovation. When DIY fixes (also known as “tape”) were no longer enough, it became clear that finally renovating for future resale was the way to go. The end result? A sunny, modern kitchen &amp; bath renovation that the family knows will bring resale value—and that they get to enjoy in the present. </span></i><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for Heather’s take on major changes in two key spaces.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/all-eyes-on-resale-for-this-kitchen-and-bath-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19324 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Heather, South Park Slope homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband, Doug, and I moved into our small condo in South Park Slope shortly after our daughter was born six years ago. The building had been abandoned in the 1970s and then turned into eight small condo units in the 1980s. We love the community, the location, and many things about our space, but the kitchen and bathroom had clearly not been updated since the original condo conversion. With our son, Elijah, and daughter, Alice, now sharing a bedroom, we knew that we would eventually need one more room, so we didn’t see any reason to renovate. But then the cupboards and the appliances began to give out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I work at a book publishing company and telecommute, so I spend a lot of time working at the kitchen table and dreamed about ripping out our old kitchen cupboards. After one too many times reapplying duct tape to the fridge shelves and silverware drawer, we decided to take the plunge and renovate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19287 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19286 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19285" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_heather_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Heather_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved reading the Sweeten renovation blogs and seeing the amazing transformation of other people’s homes. We had some recommendations for contractors from friends, but weren’t sure about the fit. So we </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osted our project</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and started to talk to contractors. What led us to choose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was his experience in renovating for resale. We were able to see some units that he was renovating in progress, and he had great suggestions for things to focus on for a possible sale in the future (like a dual showerhead, </span>which is really great for families with kids).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a classic, mostly white approach for the kitchen. Our plan was to add color with paint only, which would be easier for the next owners to change. With no edits to the layout or plumbing, we focused on choosing the materials that would make the most sense. We decided on Shaker-style cupboards from Home Depot and classic white subway tile for the kitchen backsplash from Nemo tile. Our counters are Caesarstone (from Appia Marble), the fridge is Samsung (from Home Depot), and the range is a Viking (from AJ Madison).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best changes was a little one: Previously, the stove was directly next to the sink. We added space between the sink and stove—having a place to rest a pot or put dirty plates out of view from people in the living room is very nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we continued with the same subway tile from the kitchen for the walls, but veered from the “classic” plan on the floor tile. I loved the blue tile from Nemo and the idea of having a bright color in a classic herringbone pattern. No one was sure about this when we opened the box of tiles, but it is now our (and Lem’s) favorite part of the bathroom renovation. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given our short time frame, we ended up having to make many decisions quickly. But this made some of our choices less overwhelming. Instead of having 2,000 tubs to choose from, we would look at what was in stock (only 800!). While we spent quite a bit of time at big box stores and online, we also became acquainted with a few very helpful local places in our neighborhood that we will certainly go to again. I would encourage others doing a renovation to try to get a schedule of when cupboards, appliances, etc. will be needed (if not dates, then at what point in the process) because once you are</span> into the project, there is very little time to make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our apartment was too small to live in with a renovation underway, we planned to move out for five weeks over the summer to accommodate the work. Everything went fairly smoothly, and Lem made sure that the apartment was ready for us to move back into on schedule. Given how small and close-knit our building is, I was very concerned about the renovation being disruptive for our neighbors. Lem took great care to cover the floor and other parts of the apartment so the noise wasn’t too much for our downstairs neighbors, and so that dust didn’t invade other parts of our apartment. All of the workers were respectful of our space, the building, and our neighbors, which meant a lot to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few add-on items that we chose not to do because we didn&#8217;t want to spend more money. One was having all of the outlets changed to new, stainless steel ones with USB ports. I plan to do this myself but wonder when that is going to happen. It probably would have been worth it to go ahead. The other was to have our floors redone. It seemed like too much to manage at the time, but now that the kitchen and bath look so nice, I notice how other parts of the apartment look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We LOVE our renovated space. The kitchen not only looks better, but it is infinitely easier to use and we have more storage space. It is amazing to have a real size fridge. The bathroom is also much more functional and looks bright and clean (even when it is not totally). Our old appliances in both the kitchen and the bathroom were energy intensive, and it was important to me to get an energy-efficient fridge and a low-flow toilet. They are little things in the bigger picture, but make me feel a little bit better about our environmental footprint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we’re off to Chelsea to tour an apartment rescued from someone else’s well-intentioned (but ultimately not long-lasting) DIY tile project. Cara, Jared, and their dog, Indy, moved into their one bedroom, one bathroom co-op a few years ago, and though Cara was irked by the kitchen’s layout and finishes from the beginning, the couple arrived at a point of no return last year when the mosaic tile installed by the previous owners started to fall off the wall.</p>
<p><a href=" https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-cara-and-jareds-chelsea-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14393 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg" alt="chelsea kitchen reno" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carakbathreno-2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>“Evros was able to come in, be a calming influence at a stressful time, and meet deadlines from our board and our cabinet vendor. He’ll be back to help get our place ready for the arrival of our new baby!”</strong></em><span id="more-14284"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8212; Cara and Jared, Chelsea homeowners</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the bathroom situation was the most dire – tile damage near the tub was more than just a cosmetic concern – the kitchen was also turning out to be too cramped for two cooks. Jared, a professional chef, and Cara, who works for a boutique recruiting firm, decided to press on with targeted changes to make the space more of a fit for them. After a first try with a contractor they found through a friend who wasn’t able to get buy-in from the building’s board, the couple came to Sweeten to find a team who could handle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project</a> and make sure that each “t” and every “i” would be properly crossed and dotted for building approval. We introduced Cara and Jared to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Evros</a> who gracefully took on both charges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14351 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-022-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14472 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="803" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SWEETEN_CaraKB_Before-013-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara and Jared decided early on to focus a significant chunk of their budget on built-to-order kitchen cabinetry from <a href="https://henrybuilt.com/page/henrybuilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henrybuilt</a>. They nearly tripled the kitchen’s storage by removing a partial peninsula, lengthening the counter and shelving line way out of the corner, and adding a hefty island with a huge amount of storage and prep space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new white oak cabinetry is beautifully crafted and helped dictate design and finish decisions throughout the room. The couple picked a gray plank base with a white oak line of upper cabinets. Aside from their neutral and contemporary appeal, Cara explained that Henrybuilt offers a mix and match option (high-pressure laminate along the bottom and solid wood on top) that gave them the effect of high-end cabinetry without quite having to shoulder the full cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other key design decision involved moving the stove out of the back of the room and centering it – better for hosting and better for access to the dining area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Evros’s team anchored the expanded kitchen footprint with porcelain tiles from <a href="https://www.porcelanosa-usa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcelanosa</a> and installed <a href="https://pentalquartz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentalquartz</a> counters all they way around the new line of base cabinets. Cara artfully explained that her talented husband has some, well… bull-in-china-shop tendencies when he is at work on a new culinary treat, and so their sole consideration in choosing a new counter was durability and stain resistance! The “bar block” that tops the island is a Henrybuilt signature – Cara and Jared love the accessible storage option and layered it with glass to make it easier to use in a high-traffic entryway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cara chose the neutral white backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a> for its modern simplicity and understated effect. Finishing strong with appliances, Cara and Jared headed for a big, beautiful 36” <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/products/ranges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a> concealed with a custom door panel, and a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung fridge</a> that hides Cara’s most favorite new feature: a built-in <a href="https://sodastream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SodaStream</a> faucet (this exists?!).</p>

<p>In the bathroom, Evros and his team took on a surgical task to take the old tub out, create a walk-in shower, and replace the crumbling tile that had served as the impetus for the entire project. Cara and Jared decided to leave as much intact as possible and work with what they had, so Evros made sure that the transition from the gleaming new shower to the rest of the room came off seamlessly. Everyone agreed to just do what was needed to make the necessary fixes and restore balance to the room’s function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello again from Crown Heights! We were treated to a summer tour of Colin and Orli&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/colin-and-orlis-sweetened-crown-heights-work-studio-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super creative work studio</a> and we&#8217;re back this week for a full look at the new bathroom, kitchen, and living room in their two bedroom co-op. This scenic and costume designer pair is no stranger to creating transporting spaces and pieces for the theater, but they needed heavy duty help to deal with five layers of rotting floor tiles in the bathroom and fire damage hidden behind the kitchen walls. We dispatched a Sweeten expert for huge overhauls in both rooms and for custom replica and restoration work throughout the apartment, and we were so intrigued by the possibilities in this unique space that we took identical sets of before, during, and after photos that reveal how much work went into re-creating this home. Read on through for the full story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="diningroom-hardwood-floors-kitchen-with-walnut-cabinets" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47788 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg" alt="photo of dining room with hardwood floors and crown molding and trims and another photo of kitchen with black granite countertop and walnut cabinets and tile floors after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colin_Orli-CrownHeightsApt-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-14162"></span>Colin and Orli knew they had a major project on their hands before closing on the place. The most significant demolition was needed in the bathroom, which had accumulated five different layers of floor tiles, all glued down over each other through multiple renovation attempts spanning decades. The extra floor heft was especially obvious when you stepped down into the tub &#8211; the unexpected drop was enough to catch a visitor off guard. Water damage and rotting materials extended throughout the room and down through the floorboards and joists. Pedro&#8217;s team needed to replace some of the studs, level the joists, and work through plumbing all the way back to the building&#8217;s stacks. In the kitchen, the couple intended to keep the general footprint, but uncovered fire damage from a previous tenant inside the walls. Studs with char marks, several layers of cracked flooring, and non-level sub-flooring required structural work before the fun fixtures and appliances could come anywhere near the place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Colin and Orli came up big with two distinctive tile choices in the bathroom. They headed straight for the unfailingly classic and vintage appeal of black and white hex tiles, and picked up a case of each at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/c/Bathroom_Tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. The path to new wall tile was not quite as direct &#8211; the couple admittedly agonized over finding the right color &#8211; something that would be saturated and bright, luminous and with a hand-painted feel. With a Starbucks-green glaze in mind, they found exactly what they wanted in a ceramic tile at <a href="https://www.completetile.com/products/ceramic/mcintones_ceramics/ceramic_tile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complete Tile</a>. Complete Tile also nailed all of the possible tile configurations, allowing Pedro and his team to work with rounded bullnose, chair rail, and corner tiles all in the same coordinating hues. To save the bathroom from future water damage, they picked up a new tub and fully enclosed it with tile and a sliding glass door. Pedro installed a <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/inspiration-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville</a> vanity topped with granite from <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> and fixtures from <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faucet Direct</a>, where they also found their new eco-flush toilet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Colin and Orli selected ceramic floor tiles that mimic a slate feel with organic color variation (many tiles in this style have texture or color variation that is digitally printed on top, but not these). They ordered <a href="https://www.thomasvillecabinetry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomasville cabinetry</a> from Home Depot in a whiskey black finish, which gives the kitchen a weathered, craftsman feel. They found the cabinet hardware on <a href="https://www.build.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build.com</a>, whose order and return policy made it easy to directly compare more than a dozen finishes. The new countertop has become a deeply loved piece &#8211; at the <a href="https://www.countertopsnewyorkcity.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Granite</a> shop, it was covered in a layer of dust and didn&#8217;t reveal it&#8217;s rich blue, green, and black translucent depth until it arrived for installation. All the appliances are from <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Madison</a>: the stove is a <a href="https://www.frigidaire.com/Kitchen-Appliances/Ranges/Gas-Range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fridgidaire</a> 5-burner, the fridge is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> with french doors which leave just enough room to swing open in the galley, and the modern sink faucet is <a href="https://www.moen.com/kitchen/sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moen</a>. To finish the look, Colin and Orli wrapped the room in an antique silver gloss tin backsplash tile from <a href="https://www.americantinceilings.com/shop-backsplashes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Tin Ceiling Company</a>. They managed the faux finish on the walls themselves using a basic rag roll glazing technique (but substituting lace for the rag) and finishing things off with a soft blending brush, using a similar technique that was used in the living room.  The barn light above the dining area is from <a href="https://www.barnlight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barn Light Electric</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Pedro sanded and finished the floors to preserve the original wood and inlay border with a high gloss luster. To conceal the steam heat pipe in the living room corner, Pedro boxed out the section and added a decorative grill from <a href="https://aagrilles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Architectural Grills</a>. While the work in the living room was largely cosmetic, Colin and Orli are grateful to Pedro for his painstaking replicas of much of the building&#8217;s original details. Pedro custom-built the floating shelves to carry the same ornate lines of the picture rail molding. He was also able to largely match the trim molding that had previously existed with support from Dyke&#8217;s Lumber. However, since the door and window casements were not available off the rack, he went the extra mile and personally cut hundreds of feet of trim material to match the original art deco detail Colin and Orli loved.</p>
