But, what type of remodeling companies will you need to hire for your project? Do you only need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">hire a general contractor</a>, or would you benefit from reaching out to an architect, interior designer, or even a design-build contractor? The answer will vary d<span class="s1">epending on your project scope, your preferences, and your budget. </span></p><p><span class="s1">Knowing exactly who to reach out to, and when, will save you time in the hiring process — that means you can start enjoying your remodeled home sooner.</span></p><p>Every major renovation project requires a general contractor to oversee the daily construction work. Some renovations, however, also require a licensed architect for technical and design services. This can include creating the necessary drawings for your building board or Department of Buildings (or local equivalent) permits and approvals. Even when not required, some homeowners also opt to hire architects to provide <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/">a level of style</a>, detail, and management. The added expense is sometimes estimated at 20% of the total project budget.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s important to note that there can be overlap among design services. </span><span class="s1">For example, most home remodeling architects and interior designers can provide expertise for layout and finish materials, though these specifics can vary a lot from firm to firm. If you hire an interior designer who creates updated floor plans, they may secure the services of an architect to have them professionally &#8220;stamped&#8221; when required. </span></p><p>Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">outlines what each renovation professional brings to the project.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1100" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-273x300.jpg 273w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-600x660.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><h3>When you should hire an architect</h3><p>You’ll <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need an architect</a> if any of the following apply to your renovation:</p><ul><li>Changing the layout, making additions, or tearing down walls</li><li>Moving plumbing lines such as bathtub or dishwasher</li><li>Moving gas lines</li><li>Doing work on a landmark property</li><li>Any changes that require approval from the Department of Buildings</li></ul><h3>When you should hire a general contractor</h3><p>Hiring a general contractor may best suit your job if none of the above apply to your renovation. You would also have a general idea of what you’d like to do with the space. <span class="s1">Post your project at Sweeten where most contractors can give some guidance on design, materials, and creative solutions for tackling challenges. Alternatively, you can also request a design-build firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p>NOTE: A remodeling contractor who is licensed ensures that the necessary level of checkpoints and screening processes have been met. More on this below.</p><h3>Benefits of hiring a design-build firm</h3><p>Design-build contractors can be a cost-effective option for medium to large-scale renovations. They also work well on any project that requires high <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/hudson-yards-renovation-updates-foyer-kitchen-bath/">attention to detail</a>. Design-build contractor teams offer:</p><ul><li>A full package of design, construction, and project management services</li><li>A single point of contact from start to finish</li><li>A fluid process with more predictable timelines between design and construction phases</li></ul><h3>When you should hire an interior designer</h3><p>If walls and room functions are not being altered dramatically, <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interior designer</a> can help with things like:</p><ul><li>Considering overall traffic flow, lighting, and space planning</li><li>Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/">custom built-ins and cabinetry</a></li><li>Project management and purchasing of materials, fixtures, and appliances</li><li>Choosing furniture styles, color palette, and finishes</li></ul><h3>Why you should always hire a licensed general contractor</h3><p>A locally valid license and proper insurance are a must-have for any reliable general contractor. Your county or state website will list all licensed contractors in the licensing or consumer affairs sections. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/">Sweeten&#8217;s contractor vetting</a>, for example, a New York City-based contractor must have a valid Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license. </p><h4>Getting cheaper bids from unlicensed remodeling contractors</h4><p>A note of warning to those tempted by the lower estimates of an unlicensed contractor: remodeling contractors without bonafide credentials may not be able to obtain the required permits for your job. Permits do cost money and take time to procure for any home renovation. However, if the contractor&#8217;s work fails to meet building codes, you will be responsible for the reconstruction. This can turn into an unpleasant surprise when homeowners who want to sell their home find out they must fix work that doesn&#8217;t meet permitting standards.</p><h4>Am I liable if I hire an unlicensed contractor?</h4><p>Allowing work on your property by an unlicensed remodeling contractor could also nullify your homeowner’s insurance policy. If the contractor doesn&#8217;t have workers’ compensation insurance, you become the de facto employer. You&#8217;ll be responsible for any accidents on the property (or anyone else’s property) if the contractor is negligent.</p><h3>Hire the best contractor for a home renovation</h3><p>Homeowners are rightfully concerned about how to tackle a renovation in an organized fashion. It&#8217;s best to build your team of renovation professionals based on the needs of your home renovation project, whether that involves architectural plans and permits, deciding the aesthetic or finishes, or all—or none—of the above.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitzie and Jenifer bought their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-bedroom apartment in DUMBO</a>, they knew that a full home renovation was needed before moving in. A designer, Mitzie immediately started sketching out design plans and reached out to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor who could bring those plans to life. In the home renovation tips below, Mitzie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares the couples&#8217; bedroom and kitchen renovation inspiration, and their experience working with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3918#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten general contractor</a> to improve the lighting in their new apartment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:05)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our home. My name is Mitzie Wong. I live here with my partner Jenifer Harmon, who is a media executive. I&#8217;m a painter, designer, and co-founder of <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roar + Rabbit</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:35)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the apartment feel very casual, yet luxurious. We had a budget in mind, so we were really careful about choosing the materials. We wanted it to feel very inviting and relaxing.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_41443" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-image-41443 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg" alt="kitchen and living room, kitchen renovation, living room renovation, home renovation tips for kitchen and living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-16-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-41443" class="wp-caption-text">Photos by Kate Glicksberg for Sweeten</p></div>
<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 1: </strong>A waterfall island brings living spaces together</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (00:53)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we saw the kitchen initially, it was very boxy. There were lots of angles, the cabinets were jutting out, the counters were short and narrow, so we wanted to make the place a lot more cohesive. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went for a bigger island</a>, deeper with the cascading waterfall marble sides, so it would be a feature because it&#8217;s an open plan to the living room. And we unified everything by color. Being an open plan, it had to be a feature. We hid the freezer and the fridge behind the same colors as the cabinet to make it more unified. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44522 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg" alt="home renovation designs, home renovation sketches" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Inspo-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used the same hardware on the drawers and the doors to make it more cohesive, to give it a lighter and brighter space, and we obviously brought the counter forward to give it more a generous sense of space. Because everything was so new looking, I wanted to put in a handmade tile to just soften it up, to give it some texture and some depth.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 2: Turn a plain wall into a colorful headboard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (01:58)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a fairly new building, it&#8217;s only 12 years old, so we wanted to give the apartment some character. As you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s a lot of build-outs and recesses and weird angles in each corner. I wanted to take the focal point away and make a feature wall. I used two-and-a-half-inch plywood beams and painted it to make an accent wall to give it layered depth. If you look slightly to the right, you&#8217;ll see the Manhattan bridge, and it&#8217;s a gray-blue, so that was part of the inspiration for the color. It&#8217;s a slightly off-color of the Manhattan bridge.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Home Renovation Tip 3: </strong>Streamline storage and lighting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitzie: (02:40)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We relied on our Sweeten contractor heavily on their expertise for lighting. They dropped the ceilings only two or three inches, and we were able to put in the recessed lighting in both the living room and the office, so we could maintain consistent lighting throughout the day and evening. When we were doing the initial renovation during the gutting stage, there was an additional six inches in the wall [of the master bathroom] that was revealed, so we were able to design together and build a bespoke cabinet.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27189 size-chrono" title="retail store" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Designer Rebecca Taylor store&nbsp;project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor David</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26944 mb-0 size-chrono" title="actual NYC beauty salon renovation estimate / 1,130 sq ft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail-723x533.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="533"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<h3>What is design-build?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms are a growing segment of the construction landscape. About 15% of the American Institute of Building Design (AIBD) members are now design-build firms, said Steve Mickley, the executive director of the organization, which is made up of designers, builders, and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a design-build firm takes care of both the design and construction phases of a renovation project. Traditionally, the process involved homeowners working with a designer or an architect before taking those plans over to a general contractor to execute the vision. Now, those specialties exist under one roof with design-build. Here, we explain the role of these remodeling professionals.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How are design-build companies structured? </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no clear-cut definition as to what a design-build firm is and who is in their employ. Usually, a firm will either be more design-forward, primarily led by an architect or a designer, or construction-forward with a general contractor taking the reins. Of course, some firms can be an even balance of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the scenario of the firm and your project, “the best approach is to interview as many people as it takes to find someone you feel comfortable with,&#8221; advised Mickley. That could mean going with a design-build firm or handpicking a designer and a general contractor. This more traditional method is called design, bid, and build, or DBB. It is where the designer or architect is hired separately from the general contractor. </p>
<h4>Are professional design services always necessary for a remodel?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not every remodeling project needs a designer or architect. According to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association, only 22% of homeowners renovating a kitchen or bathroom seek professional design assistance. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down their total costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if the scope of your project involves structural changes like moving load-bearing walls or shifting plumbing or gas lines, you will at least need an architect or engineer to approve your renovation plans. Bringing in design help is also a good option if you want meticulous planning and attention to visual details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What are the benefits of hiring a design-build company?</h3>
<h4>&#8220;One-stop&#8221; shop</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms operate as a “one-stop shop” for home construction, said Mickley. This means homeowners only need to explain their vision to one person who then communicates it to the single design-build team. This is also the case throughout the project. If a change needs to be made, no need to discuss it with your designer or architect and then communicate it to your general contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a design-build firm, you should have one point person throughout the entire length of your project who is accountable for the timeline, the budget, and delivering what the homeowner wants. “The same person who has the vision has the responsibility to make that happen,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Project management help</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some homeowners want to closely oversee their renovations. Others don’t. For the latter group, a design-build firm might be a good fit. Rather than the homeowner overseeing the two moving parts of the design and construction phase, a design-build firm watches over both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a little help with managing a project but aren’t sure you want a design-build firm to take care of the whole thing, some designers or architects may offer a service to help oversee the job. “This is where the designer or architect makes periodic site visits to make sure the general contractor is doing everything to the specifications,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Guaranteed synergy</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s always a risk of a personality clash when you pair two humans together. That includes your choice of designer or architect and general contractor. They could work together seamlessly, or they could not. Working with a design-build firm basically eliminates that risk. The design half and construction half would have worked together on many projects and likely created a firm together based on their positive collaboration. “Depending on the project, you could be working with them for six to 12 months, so it’s best to choose wisely,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A faster project</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong with any project and slow the timeline down, including one managed by a design-build firm. However, this type of firm will likely complete a job at a faster pace. A study commissioned by the DBIA found that commercial projects using design-build firms finished about 33% faster than those that used the traditional design, bid, and build process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s reason to think residential projects could also move faster with a design-build firm. That’s because there is likely an overlap between the design and construction phase rather than a lull in momentum when the design phase ends and a general contractor takes up the build phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes you make along the way could also be done faster, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary</a>, who heads up a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>-vetted design-build firm. Often with the traditional design, bid, and build workflow, a change to your project will require some back and forth between architect and general contractor to see what’s possible and what the best way forward is. This could hold the project up for weeks or more. With a design-build firm, you have your architect and builder already working together and abreast of the project. “Pretty much within a couple of days we can have everything sorted out,” said Gary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less expensive (maybe)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that design-build is slowly gaining momentum in the residential market, the data isn’t yet available to know what workflow method is easier on the pocketbook. In commercial construction, DBIA found that projects with this category of professionals came in at six percent cheaper when compared with similar jobs using the design, bid, and build workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why you might NOT prefer design-build</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less control</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned above, a design-build firm generally means less control for the homeowner, which is great if that’s what you want. However, if you know you want to be hands-on with your construction project, take that into consideration when choosing between design-build or the typical design, bid, and build.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less choice of professionals</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, this can be a pro or a con. It’s definitely a con if you have your heart set on an architect and a general contractor who are not part of the same firm. One thing Mickley advised when considering a design-build firm is to ensure they can produce quality designs. “Some design-build firms call themselves that, but they really don’t possess the design portion,” he said. “They just subcontract that out.”</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">More objective solutions</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having the eyes of a separate general contractor and architect could mean more objective observations about how your project is progressing. It could also mean more ideas. If there’s a problem in need of a solution, you have your architect or designer as well as your general contractor to brainstorm with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sweeten can help you hire the right firm</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which way you ultimately lean on your construction and design, selecting who you work with is a crucial decision. “Once you’ve made that decision, you have to give them your full trust,” said Gary.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h2></h2>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933324509"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is design-build?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms are firms that provide a homeowner with a general contractor, architect, and/or interior designer. They are considered “one-stop” shops because they offer varying services within one company. Design-build firms might be more design-based, some more construction-heavy, and others have a good balance of each. A positive aspect of these firms is communication: because these teams are built to work together, there’s less confusion about responsibilities or how to connect with the renovating homeowner.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933385594"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are design-build firms more expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms can be more expensive to work with than construction-only firms because the service level they offer is higher. These firms are ideal for renovating homeowners who want to (or need to) enlist the help of an architect and/or interior designer, in addition to a general contractor. For example, homeowners doing a transformational gut renovation will likely need the help of a design-build firm.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;ve been following this high-style, high-design project in Chelsea for the last year. The owner of this 900 square foot apartment in the iconic London Terrace building is a friend of Sweeten&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jean. We watched as the homeowner and contractor worked together to bring new life to a space with gorgeous historical roots and we were so psyched about the work happening here, we did what any friend would do: take the referral of a great contractor! These photos would probably be convincing enough, but as we do with every expert in our network, we checked references and interviewed the contractor to get a feel for his talents, expertise, experience, and professionalism. After finishing the project and going through the Sweeten screening process, we&#8217;re delighted to introduce <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/226">Sweeten Expert Gregorio</a> as a new member of our network of professionals. I&#8217;ll have more to share with you this spring about how our screening process works, but first, you have to see these swoon-worthy photos!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11305 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-041-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jean&#8217;s friend, an architect, had lived in the building for almost a decade before this unit hit the market. Prior to moving in, the new homeowner set out to address two main issues: the apartment had a series of cramped rooms dotted with small closets, and the entryway was unnecessarily divided in two segments. Both of these elements were disruptive to the flow, feel, and function of the space<span id="more-11282"></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results of addressing these two goals alone were dramatic: by combining and moving a closet from the entry hall into the bedroom for a larger walk-in, and annexing another storage area into the bathroom for a true linen closet, the owner opened up the flow of the rooms and created far more functional storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11318 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Storage aside, the owner took a meticulous approach to recreating the visual presence of the building&#8217;s heritage. Sweeten Expert Gregorio added accentuated molding details throughout each room to exaggerate the space and add a grander feel. The homeowner was able to keep the original wood floors but transformed them with a matte black finish. The resulting contrast with the white and gray color palette makes the space feel bright but also infuses each room with some grit. It looks natural and effortless now, but it took the homeowner more than six tries, and eight coats, to get the stain effect he had in mind!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11306 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-051-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11307 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-061-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11308 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-071-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio&#8217;s team removed the kitchen island, expanded the flooring into the kitchen to unify the living space, installed white lacquer cabinets, white calacatta countertops, and put in a 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11312 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-111-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner designed the custom built-in millwork in the living room with a high-gloss lacquer section combined with a walnut storage unit to create a light, bright feel complemented by the warmth of the natural wood. The millwork hovers cleanly over the floor, doubling as a showcase for favorite items and as a hideaway for the tv. To continue the play on materials, the radiators were stripped to expose original metals. The new radiators are an unlikely star of the show: visitors to the apartment typically comment first on the apartment&#8217;s views and then on the metallic radiators. A circular lighting fixture from Ochre anchors the living room between original ceiling beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11309 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-081-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11310 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-091-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11311 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="955" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101-188x300.jpg 188w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-101-565x900.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregorio worked through a full upgrade of the windowed bathroom, removing the tub to replace it with a walk-in glass shower, ripping out old tile and bringing in black travertine slabs, and swapping out old fixtures with modern sink and toilet selections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, the homeowner designed a second custom built-in that beautifully offsets the neutral palette. Throughout the apartment, in a nod to his architecture and fashion background, the homeowner chose Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Coventry Gray (HC 169), a color favored in Dior stores around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11313 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg" alt="chelsea london terrace renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SWEETEN_kevinVAptRenovation-121-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So many thanks to Jean&#8217;s friend and Sweeten Expert Gregorio for a peek into this brilliantly designed and expertly built home.</p>
