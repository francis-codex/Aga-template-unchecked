<p style="text-align: justify;">When the deal fell through on a new, larger apartment, Zoe and Arvid decided to stay put in their Lincoln Square building in Manhattan and make their 700-square-foot one-bedroom work. But two years later, the cramped space won out, and they went on the hunt for a new home. Zoe, who admits to an unhealthy relationship with HGTV, dreamt of buying, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining</a>, and renovating an adjoining apartment. They decided to send letters to their adjacent neighbors and, to their surprise, one was looking to move, so they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What Zoe, who works in finance, and Arvid, a 3-D designer, wanted most was extra space where they could spread out and finally be able to sit down at a proper dining table instead of crouching over the coffee table. For style, the couple would need to compromise. Zoe liked mid-century modern and rustic looks while Arvid preferred clean, modern lines with a dash of industrial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor they chose</a> to combine their apartments set out to remove the two existing kitchens, rip out old parquet-glued-to-concrete floors, and demo some internal walls to create a third bedroom. They moved into a sublet during much of the work.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33713 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before02-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33690 size-chrono" title="brown-vinyl-floor-white-room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg" alt="brown vinyl floor in a white living room with blue wall after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33693 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-33.gif" alt="renovation, apartment combination, accent wall, hardwood floors, hidden storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few “must-haves” as the couple thought through the design. Since they’re a “<span style="color: #333333;">shoes-off household,</span>” said Zoe, they needed a storage solution near the entrance. The answer, literally, was hidden in a structural column close to where they broke through the two apartments. At first, the duo tossed around ideas about how to make the column “purposeful.” Their ideas ranged from a gas fireplace to a wine fridge. Instead, they chose &#8220;practical,&#8221; she said, and created a hidden shoe closet. “Our contractor really worked with us on hardware—concealed hinges and push-open latch—and hand-sawed the baseboard to get a wider angle for the slide-out racks,” she explained. The shoe slide-out from Elfa fit the space, and to give it a sense of design, it was painted a deep accent color for some contrast and to hide dirt on the push-open door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When they opened the wall that would be the spot for the<span style="color: #333333;"> dining room</span>, the mood dampened for a moment when they found an unmovable gas riser. “We decided to make lemonade out of this,” said Zoe and thought about how to turn it into a design element. They settled on a “partition” type of structure that took the least amount of space while letting the light through. They found Blacktable Studio to walk them through the process. As a 3-D designer, Arvid took the lead on this fun project, creating the designs and submitting his sketches. The panels were delivered two weeks later. “Our contractor carefully installed the panel and adjusted the baseboard to make a seamless connection. This graphic panel is now a nice focal point that adds a lot of character,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33707 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, dining room, edison lighting, wood table" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also liked the idea of having an extendable table for extra guests. “We never had a proper dining area before, so the prospect of having one definitely prompted a lot of imaginary dinner parties,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33709 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before01-723x933.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33696 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, hardwood floors, bar seating" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, kitchen, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-24-723x1067.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, hidden storage, accent wall" width="723" height="1067" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33706 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-22-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, backsplash tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the couple’s time was spent looking for <span style="color: #333333;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flooring</a></span> because it was the most prominent backdrop in the apartment and would set the tone for everything else. They wanted wide 7” to 8&#8243; European-style planks that were not too light or too dark. Arvid spent a lot of time finding the right hue, saturation, and wood grain. “It turned into a bit of an obsessive pursuit and we finally agreed on a natural color that&#8217;s very rustic with knots and saw marks. It&#8217;s a bit of a risk, but most people seem to love it,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33719 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-34-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, living room" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, there was an AC/radiator below the window. More than 50 years of painting had “made it a big sad mess,” Zoe said. They wanted to cover it and also make it functional. Their Sweeten contractor listened to their input, and, she said, “we just designed it on the fly. One weekend Arvid used leftover black sample paint to paint over the heating elements behind the built-in.” This created more contrast against the outside white paint. Now the built-in&#8217;s horizontal slats look crisper, and you can barely see the mechanical elements behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other detail they focused on was smart light switches. The commonly available ones didn’t look good and the modern looking ones were way out of their budget. They took a chance on Noon Home, a start-up company selling ones around $100. “We couldn’t be happier,” she said. “The product looks modern and the app works great.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33701 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-16-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bedroom, accent wall, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33702 mb-0 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-white-glass-door" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-32.gif" alt="blue wall and a white glass door and light brown floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compromise their style preferences, they invented a design hybrid they called “Scandinavian mid-century” with a lot of black and white and plenty of geometric shapes. They learned the importance of taking time to plan a renovation. “Do a lot of showrooming and Pinteresting; both help you to know what you like,” Zoe said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33714 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-Before04-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33700 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, chevron tile, glass shower door" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once the work starts, there is little time to decide,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” Zoe measured the maximum size of her pots and condiments and knew the drawer heights she needed. The only shortfall of planning too well is that you might become too attached to certain choices. She suggests being prepared for changes and understand that sometimes, you’ll have to go with the second choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33705 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-10-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation, apartment combination, bathroom, glass shower door, chevron tile" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of some permit delays, the apartment was not ready for move-in after their sublet ended. For three weeks, they began an Airbnb-hopping adventure. “It&#8217;s a lot of stress, but we discovered different neighborhoods and lifestyles. We now know for sure commuting to New Jersey is not meant for us,” Zoe said. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living on-site</a> for the second half of the project was a big challenge and meant being around a lot of dust and living out of suitcases. Now that it’s completed, she said their new home makes them feel “happy!”</p>

<h3>A new home becomes a passion project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate, both freelance advertising creatives from Brooklyn, bought a 2,010-square-foot house in Long Island, NY. Built in 1994 by the previous owner, Nate found the home in good condition. “Luckily, the house didn’t need anything to enjoy it right away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We looked at it as a fun long-term project to turn it into an escape from the city,” Nate said. Nestled in the woods and surrounded by local farms, wineries, and nearby beaches, the Long Island home was perfect for their plans. The first item on the to-do list was to add another bathroom.</p>

<h3>A closet repurposed</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it easier to accommodate guests, the couple wanted each bedroom to have its own bath. There was a large alcove in the upstairs hallway that they thought would be the perfect ensuite guest bathroom. It was conveniently located above the downstairs bathroom and plumbing so they hoped it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to transform. “Our main question was really just how difficult would it be to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516480067964000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGyH1pCCFGN6MXH3vylt6iOnb95Dw">add a bathroom</a> where one hadn’t existed before,” said Nate. He posted their Riverhead bathroom remodel on Sweeten and was <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We had to be out of town a lot during the work, but our contractor was really good about sending work-in-progress pictures.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>A modern farmhouse bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before getting started, Michelle and Nate nailed down the look and feel of the bath, opting for a modern country vibe that was clean and simple. Because the angled roof affected one of the walls, they got creative with the layout, choosing to build a triangular storage nook in the uniquely-shaped space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shiplap was added to the slanted wall, giving the room the desired farmhouse style the couple hoped to achieve. They also incorporated some personal touches, including handmade shelves that Nate built from reclaimed wood. A pull-out drawer was repurposed from an old door to hold cleaning supplies and extra toilet paper. For the entry, the couple took a style cue from the neighboring farms. “We especially like the look and function of the sliding barn door,” Nate said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="White farmhouse sink over wooden vanity Riverhead bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49142" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Managing the Riverhead bathroom remodel from afar</h3>
<p>Michelle and Nate searched a variety of brands to outfit their bath but always found themselves coming back to one retailer. “The nice thing about getting fixtures from one place is that you know the metals will match. Oil-rubbed bronze, for example, can look very different from one brand to the next,” said Nate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We had to be out of town a lot during the work but our contractor was really good about sending work-in-progress photos,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The pictures helped make sure things came together the way we imagined them.&#8221;</p>
