			<h2 class="p1">Your dream basement renovation is possible. Here are the technical codes to tick off with your contractor.</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48554 mb-10 size-full" title="light-brown-vinyl-floor-basement" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg" alt="Light brown vinyl floor in gray and white basement with stairs and banister after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> <span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Tracy and Gordon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> added living space to their small footprint</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many benefits to upgrading a dark, damp basement to an inviting living space. Basement renovations can add significant square footage—and resale value—to a home. And it can be a blank slate; something to reimagine for any of your family&#8217;s needs, including entertaining, working from home, or relaxing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to your wish list, you&#8217;ll need to consider several technical and building code details, such as minimum ceiling heights, emergency egress regulations, insulation, and moisture control. These will influence your basement renovation&#8217;s timeline and cost.</p>
<p>We offer an overview of what would be involved. A vetted general contractor with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement remodeling experience</a> would provide a more in-depth discussion of what is possible in your space.</p>
<h3>Typical costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors have worked on basement remodels starting at $20,000. This price point would update an already finished space and include painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. For a raw space that is being renovated to a finished living area, the average cost is $75,000. With this budget, you&#8217;ll likely be able to include a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The existing condition of the space will always impact the budget. The floor may need to be dug deeper to increase ceiling height. The walls may require underpinning. New wiring and plumbing may need to be installed—guaranteed if you&#8217;re planning a whole new kitchen or bathroom. Insulation and waterproofing may be needed to control condensation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happily, according to our contractors, there are no deal-breakers when it comes to basement renovations. Any problem—bad plumbing, lack of natural light, high humidity, a low ceiling—can all be sorted to create your dream basement. Ultimately, it will all depend on how much you are willing to spend. “It’s a balancing act to how much you want to put into the house before you exceed what value it brings,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan, a Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;You also have to decide if cost value is important to you or is it more important to have a home you want to live in.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Square footage determines a basement renovation budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in the renovation cost, as well as in the value it adds to your home. Sweeten general contractor Kyle says that his smallest basement renovation added just 400 square feet of living space, to be used as a kids&#8217; play area. More typical basement renovations are around 1,000 square feet, he said. And don’t forget: If the basement houses equipment, like a furnace or boiler, a mechanical room could take away a few hundred square feet from the livable space.</p>
<h3>Ceiling height requirements for basement renovations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although building regulations vary from town to town, our contractors say the minimum height requirement for ceilings will be between six and seven feet. You may choose to add more height than this, for comfort and aesthetics. About 50% of basement jobs require the floor to be dug lower to allow for additional ceiling height. This process involves cracking open the existing concrete floor, removing the excess dirt, and re-laying the concrete.</p>
<h3>Creating a second form of egress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you envision creating a living space for your basement, rather than a laundry and storage area? If so, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need a second exit, also called an egress. &#8220;To be comfortable and have no problems with building inspectors, you will need that second form of egress, such as a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level,&#8221; said Kyle, a Sweeten contractor. That usually means digging down to make an open passageway on one side of the building so there is a way to get in and out.</p>
<h3>Basement renovations that add plumbing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, homeowners will add a half or a full bath to their new basement space. The plumbing for this usually goes under the concrete flooring. This will help avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Since your basement living space will probably be below sewer lines, you&#8217;ll need a pump to get waste out, said Kyle. Of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a bathroom</a> will also add to the budget, but for many, the convenience is worth it, he said.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing and insulation protection</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basements account for the majority of your home&#8217;s indoor moisture, according to Alan. On top of the general humidity in your basement, flooding may be a periodic problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to moisture problems is often insulation and waterproofing. There are intelligent products that can help. If a conversion involves a bedroom, it is especially important to control moisture, to prevent toxic from forming. In-wall products like <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/building-insulation/products/membrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed’s MemBrain</a> is an accessory to regular insulation that allows the buildup of moisture to escape while preventing moisture from entering in the first place. Its 2-step installation process will add a few extra days to a basement renovation timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with intelligent products, insulation requires multiple products and systems to stay on top of heat, cold, and humidity, according to Ted Winslow, a representative from CertainTeed. This could mean using spray foam to fill in cracks and seal windows and doors, along with other insulation products.</p>
<h3>Improving basement ventilation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent toxic mold, the humidity of living spaces should be kept below 60 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-course-chapter-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Achieving this often requires ventilation, in addition to waterproofing and insulation. Relying on natural airflow from windows is possible, but its subject to the weather and seasons. Extending your home&#8217;s existing HVAC system will also help ventilate the basement area. However, many basements will require the direct removal of humidity. Kareem suggests installing exhaust fans into the wall or window. These push damp air out while circulating the remaining air around the entire house. This system can either turn on when the lights are switched on, or be equipped with sensors that switch the fans on once humidity gets above a certain level. A dehumidifier is another option, but be prepared to pump that wastewater up to the sewer lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p>If you have the extra square footage of a basement, why not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a laundry room</a> down there?</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in costs. Additionally, adding a kitchen or bathroom to a basement will increase costs considerably, so keep your remodel simple–painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. However, don’t skimp on humidity-controlling features: basements are prone to wetness, causing toxic mold. Be sure to install a good HVAC system, exhaust fans, or a dehumidifier.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065183452"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make a basement into a living space</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, make sure the ceiling height is adequate–at least 6-7 feet. You’ll also need a second form of egress, which is an exit from the lower level to the outside. This could be a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level. To create an egress, you’ll need to dig down to make an open passageway on one side of the building to create the way in and out.

<p class="schema-faq-answer">To add a bathroom to a basement, you’ll need new wiring and plumbing, which usually goes under the concrete flooring. Although it can be costly, a benefit to adding plumbing beneath the flooring is that you’ll avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Additionally, you may also need insulation and waterproofing to control condensation, which can cause mold growth in basements. Since most basements are below sewer lines, you’ll need a pump to get waste out.</p>

<h3>An unwelcoming basement</h3>
<p>Proud. Calm. Organized. It was hard to imagine a trip down to our cellar—a dark, dank space that I never wanted to set foot in—summoning these feelings. But renovating this space into a fully functioning basement gave us a dedicated workspace for my business while adding an entire floor of living space to our home. It also satisfied some serious storage needs and gave us an occasional guest room for family visits.</p>

<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48715 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg" alt="" width="1110" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05.jpg 1110w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/49870-Danielle-Basement05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px" /></div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We live in a three-family Brooklyn brownstone built in the early 1900s. We&#8217;ve owned it for three-and-a-half years. I am Danielle, owner of <a href="http://www.revampinteriordesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revamp Interior Design</a>; Jevaun is my husband and a design director; Zidane is our son and Katara is our dog. We occupy the parlor, garden, and cellar levels of the building, and the top floors are rental units. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47071" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg" alt="basement remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/sweeten-brownstone-renovation-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we bought the place</a>, we have been redoing it one section at a time, and this was the last of the major projects. We wanted to do a renovation in the basement, which the previous owner had never refinished after a flood years ago. It wasn&#8217;t in great shape: the drywall had been ripped out to prevent mold, and the room had no ventilation or natural light. Junk was accumulating down there. The laundry area was way in the back, and we (I) had to walk through hell to do a load. It was sad.</span></p>

<h3>Organization for a basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The space needed to become a beautiful workhorse of an office. But it had to function, too, as a standard basement and store our family’s things in an organized way. We needed places for coats, tools, luggage, and linens. I came up with this gallery idea with </span><span class="s8">a modern, open look, </span><span class="s1">and we posted our basement remodel project on Sweeten</span><span class="s8">. I wanted one wall to retain the exposed masonry, for texture and grit. For the floors, I planned to pour an epoxy layer over the existing concrete. My</span><span class="s1"> running joke: If I could walk through the basement barefoot, mission accomplished! </span></p>
<h3>Finding new general contractors</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I work in the renovation business, so I initially bid out the job with contractors I’ve worked with. But they were all tied up with projects. I didn’t want to have competing deadlines. Through Sweeten, I met some <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced general contractors</a>. We chose a contractor who seemed most capable and most excited about the job. The cherry on top: He was insanely easy to work with. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Lighting takes centerstage</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goal was to make it bright and spacious. When we moved in, our vision included a den and guest bedroom in the basement. Then I started having this recurring (and prescient!) dream in which I was working from home, and the conversion plan shifted: I wanted to turn it into a design gallery and studio. I needed a workspace with a big, open surface to work with materials and review large drawings. Because of this, lighting would be key. Color is a big part of what I do and it felt critical to have a bright, blank canvas as the backdrop for my work.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47075" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>I knew that lighting was the aspect of the redo that would have the most impact. We put in 18 recessed LED ceiling lights; there was not a dark corner in the room. Susan Chan, a specialist at <a href="https://fengshuicreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feng Shui Creative</a> and a friend, recommended I add “uplighting”—fixtures that direct the light upwards—to lift the room’s energy. I thought she was crazy and couldn’t think how to make that work—the ceilings are barely eight feet high. But boy, was she right! The gorgeous pendant fixture I chose made a huge difference in the space, adding both diversity to the light and focus over the island.</p>
<h3>Epoxy floors for a chic basement remodel</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After we cleared out the stuff, the team sheetrocked the walls and poured the epoxy floor. The exposed masonry wall didn’t turn out as naturally beautiful as we’d hoped it would, but we went with it. The contractors built out closets under the stairs, installed a storage island for a work surface, and hung lots of open shelving. We painted the walls, floors, and stairs in a perfect white—not too cool, not too warm. The furniture plan was the toughest part. I find a “bonus room”—an everything space with 10,000 functions—the hardest to get right for my clients, and it was no different for me. I created a wide-open room and didn&#8217;t want the things I put in it to make it feel cramped.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47074 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-09.jpg" alt="basement renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47076" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg" alt="basement storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Danielle-Basement-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting to the finish line</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the room came together, our contractor stopped by often, checking on progress and clarifying details. He gave me a six-week project schedule. The basement remodel was finished the day he promised. The usual setbacks occurred—construction delays, order lags—and our project had surprises, but the crew kept pace and we didn’t go over budget. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also offered support</a> throughout the project, if needed.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at the finished project, I have so many favorite bits, beginning with the added space. Each floor of the building is about 900 square feet, so we increased usable space by 50 percent—we now have 2,700 square feet. The very best reward downstairs: the perfect lighting. I can work around the clock and never know what time it is. I jokingly call it Vegas!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our </span><span class="s1">most up-to-date New Jersey </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and New Jersey <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48221" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts--300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts--600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">For a budget kitchen remodel in New Jersey, costs start at $20,000 to $25,000. Mid-range remodels start at $30,000 and go up from there.

<p class="schema-faq-answer">For a low-end NJ bathroom renovation, budget $15,000 to $20,000. This covers a 5’x8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.

<p class="schema-faq-answer">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit. So, it depends! Are you doing a simple bathroom renovation where the fixtures are being directly replaced (a “rip-and-replace”)? You may not need permits. However, you should have a licensed general contractor review the space to confirm if you’ll need permits for a bathroom remodel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A New Jersey basement transforms into a spot for music, lounging, and laundry</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2015, Cristiana and her husband fell in love with a beautiful old house in New Jersey&#8217;s Bergen County. Original details from 1918 had been preserved, and</em> <em>the space was just right for the family of four. While the above-grade spaces were solid and charming, the basement needed some serious TLC. It featured outdated finishes from the 1970s, low ceilings (a big problem for Cristiana’s tall husband!), and a damp, musty feel. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cristiana knew that the valuable square footage could be turned into a family room, with space left over for wine and pantry storage as well as an updated laundry room. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/17760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found this contractor</a> to </em><em>convert an uninviting cave into a comfortable spot for the whole family.</em></p>
<p><em><img decoding="async" title="kids-playing-on-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48555 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Kids playing on the vinyl floor with toys after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Guest post by Bergen County, New Jersey, homeowner Cristiana</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago, we were moving from a 750-square-foot apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey, which felt like it was bursting at the seams. When we purchased our early Craftsman Colonial home, we knew there would be lots of work to do. But it felt solid, had the right number of bedrooms and bathrooms and great, livable space. Plus, the original unpainted chestnut moldings and leaded glass built-ins throughout the new house made any renovations that we needed to do seem bearable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-DURING.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="beige-carpeted-basement-blue-couch"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48543" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige carpeted basement with blue couch and furniture before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cristiana_Basement-75-AFTER.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="open-wiring-and-pipes-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-During-1.jpg" alt="open wiring and pipes during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-During-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-During-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-During-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" title="light-brown-vinyl-floor-basement"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg" alt="Light brown vinyl floor in gray and white basement with stairs and banister after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Before we were able to move in, we needed to completely rewire the entire house because it still had knob-and-tube wiring. This meant demolishing the &#8217;70s-style finished basement. We weren’t that upset about losing the brown paneling, damp rug, and linoleum-tiled laundry room, and we were saving a lot of money by allowing the electrician free access to the walls and ceiling of the basement. The space had to be refurbished before it could be used for anything besides storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a couple of months of rewiring, patching, and painting, we temporarily relocated the toy storage and our TV to the enclosed front porch and began working with an architect to rethink the space. We came to Sweeten to find a contractor to execute our architect’s vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our plans included moving the laundry room to free up the main living area for toys, creating a craft area, and carving out a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wine room</a>. An old phone booth left behind by the previous owners was relocated. We hoped to move as many pipes in the labyrinth hanging from the ceiling to provide more headroom for my 6’ 4” husband and our two future six-footers—our sons, currently ages six and eight. New windows were installed and additional waterproofing was added throughout the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Christiana_Basement-66-e1508331601201.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="gray-white-basement-recessed-shelves"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48553" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg" alt="Gray and white basement area with recessed shelves and view of handrail and banister after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="oak-vinyl-plank-flooring-basement"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48558" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg" alt="Oak vinyl plank flooring in white entertainment room after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we got started working with our Sweeten contractor, we tried to determine where waterproofing was necessary and figured out what pipes could be moved and what had to stay. We ran PEX pipes for water in the walls and were able to run all electricity through the ceiling. We had to leave our steam pipes for our original but completely functional heating system because it was cost-prohibitive to move them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our contractor also created easy access points for a (hopefully not so distant) kitchen renovation. In the end, the ceiling in the basement was raised from under six-and-a-half feet to over eight feet tall—a huge improvement and a crucial part of the renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the not-so-glamorous phases of waterproofing, plumbing, and electric were completed, we began to see the new rooms take shape. We were surprised by the space that needed to be left between the block walls and the drywall for fireproofing but decided to incorporate built-ins for board games as well as arts-and-crafts supplies. Our contractor also built a custom shelving unit under our TV to help prevent kids from walking into the corner of the TV when it was pulled out from the wall. The area under the stairs turned into a fort for the boys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the walls, we chose a warm gray paired with a soft white trim. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a> are COREtec, which looks like walnut but is actually an engineered plank that’s perfect for below-grade spaces. This was one of our contractor’s best recommendations—a floating floor that is easily replaced if it gets wet, feels great underfoot, and looks amazing. We love it, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it!</p>

A wall-mounted drying rack is one of my favorite features. My kids and husband have turned the storage room into a music room, but as long as they don’t mind playing next to our second freezer and extra Cheerios, it works for me!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That’s about it for the first phase of our basement renovation. Of course, there are still items on the to-do list. We are planning to turn the wooden phone booth at the bottom of the stairs into a fun space for the boys<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>it has working electricity, so we are hoping to wire it with wifi or as a charging station. We will also either paint it red (Londonesque) or blue (Doctor Who!), and add a plaque on the top with our last name. Next to the phone booth is a door that leads to our unfinished wine room, another project for the future.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="couple-with-two-kids-in-entertainment-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48556 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg" alt="Couple with two kids in the entertainment room after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For now, though, we love spending time in our new basement—and getting dedicated storage for the toys, drums, and storage off the main floor! It’s become a great family room for us to hang out in, and for the boys to play with their friends. Working with our Sweeten contractor was an amazing experience. He was cooperative, made great suggestions, and brought the project in on budget.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Gordon</i></span></p>
<h3>A new start for an old home</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home, a brick townhouse in the Sunnyside Garden Historic District, was built in 1925 in one of the first planned communities inspired by the <span class="s2">English Garden Movement </span>in the United States. This enclave in the borough of Queens was originally developed to promote green space and community while providing affordable housing to working-class folks. Tracy, a financial analyst, and I, a teacher, had been living in the neighborhood for some time when we purchased the house, a former rental that hadn’t been improved since the early ‘90s. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/">We had a lot of ideas for updating it</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">We felt lucky to find a three-story home of roughly 1,200 square feet, or 400 square feet per floor. The townhouse had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and that was more than enough for the two of us, our cats, Laurel and Juniper, and our dog, Ballou. We wanted to gut-renovate both baths and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul our underutilized basement</a>. If we could squeeze in maximum function on every level, the house would feel more modern and bigger.</span></p>

<h3>Remodeling a landmarked townhouse</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We had <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/">renovated the kitchen</a> just after buying the house four years ago. The job, a mix of DIY projects and subcontractor commissions, was successful but laborious. We were recovered and ready to tackle the next phase, but understood that <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">the difficulty of the work would exceed our own abilities</a>, as would the red tape. Because we own a landmarked building, we would have to secure not only the expected Department of Buildings paperwork but also obtain Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) permits and approvals on all work impacting the building’s exterior. We knew our general contractor would assume much of this burden, which made us feel more comfortable diving in.</span></p>

<span class="s1">We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead.</span></p>

<h3>Giving new life to the basement</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the whole renovation, the basement would be the larger piece, the goal was to increase the house’s usable space. Before we started, the basement was a large, unlevel room. Thanks to the old home’s process of settling, there was a two-inch difference in floor height from the walls to the room’s center. It had an outdated bathroom and poorly planned utility areas. A previous owner had installed an awkwardly placed cabinet and sink in the middle of the big room, and the washer and dryer next to the 40-year-old boiler, making laundry day a sweaty affair. The basement bathroom was dark and dank. We wanted to recreate the basement as a study, gaming/movie space, music center, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/healing-home-space/">cat sanctuary</a> with storage, laundry, and a hospitable second bathroom.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>A Queens basement remodel to be livable</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We started in the downstairs, where we first had to level the floor. We dreamed of a polished concrete floor but settled for large, matte concrete-effect tiles instead. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/">The cost and challenge of doing a poured floor</a> just didn’t make it practical, and we were ultimately happy with an alternative that gave the room a similar feel at a lower cost. After losing two inches of headspace in the leveling of the floor, our Sweeten contractor suggested raising the ceiling by exposing and painting the heating pipe—easy, since they were replacing the room’s drywall, anyway. A new basement door, window, and vents for the bathroom and boiler room were installed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, they subdivided the space, creating a new living area, a storage room, and an expanded bathroom. LPC approvals, necessary for the new exterior basement door and window, as well as bathroom and laundry venting, went through smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42855 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg" alt="bathroom image after remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><em>(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; basement bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42851 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom sink" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-concrete-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That leads me to the renovation’s second and equally important part: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/">the bathroom remodels</a>. The basement bath would get a complete gut job to remove a creepy stall shower, and an expansion to make room for a freestanding bathtub. The windowless downstairs bathroom needed to be bright and clean. We went for a spare look, choosing large wall tiles, a custom concrete sink, and a wall-hung toilet, in addition to the beautiful bathtub. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">A tub-turned-shower for the master bath</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our upstairs bath would also be gutted and refreshed, with a glass-walled shower replacing the old tub-and-shower setup. We couldn’t make the</span><span class="s3"> 30-square-foot room bigger, </span><span class="s1">but <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/renovation-tips-bigger-bathroom/">we could up its storage and functionality</a>. Upstairs, we went for a modern toilet and a compact, wall-mount sink, along with a recessed medicine cabinet, and toothbrush niche. We installed rectangular wall tiles vertically for a playful effect. Both baths got recessed lighting.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><em><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42840 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg" alt="black hexagon bathroom floor tile, clear shower doors" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gordon-bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(Above) &#8220;After&#8221; upstairs bathroom</span></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was finally time to finish the basement, we were excited to be able to install the shelving system ourselves; the contractor made it easy by mounting wood blocking between the wall studs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/">We wanted built-ins</a>, but the wall-shelving was more cost-effective and looks great. We offset neutral surfaces with books, wood accents, and colorful velvet furnishings. One takeaway we agree on: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweetens-splurge-vs-save-renovation-guide-a-breakdown-by-room/">Don’t cheap out on hardware</a>; the difference shows as it wears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only downside, in the end, was that the price of the project came in much more than we anticipated after we had to replace the boiler and a rotted drainpipe. Once we finalized the task list, though, our Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget. Doubling our living space has had such an impact on our daily life. We don’t have a single regret!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Connecticut couple refreshes their first townhouse</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2016, Brooklyn homeowner Lauren embarked on her first Sweeten renovation. The result: a beautiful <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alcove studio</a> that was featured in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times story</a> on organizing small spaces. In 2017, she moved to Connecticut to join her fiancé and upgraded to a 3,000-square-foot condo in Stamford. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Space was no longer an issue, but the home appeared to be stuck in the early ‘80s. There was also a suspiciously damp smell from the accumulation of several leaks during the previous owners&#8217; time there. Given her positive past experience with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, Lauren returned to post her latest project to find the best contracting team. (Luckily, Sweeten had recently expanded its free service, matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, to Fairfield County.) Read on for her take on renovating with Sweeten outside of New York City!</em></p>

Guest post by Stamford homeowner Lauren</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is now my second Sweeten renovation and my first time renovating with my fiancé, Austin. After remodeling my Brooklyn Heights co-op, I ended up moving to Stamford, Connecticut, the following year and started looking for a condo to buy with Austin. The search didn’t take long and we found a 3-bed, 2.5-bath townhouse that was in need of some updating before we moved in. The unit had lots of potential, but it was dated and hadn’t really been touched since it was first built over 30 years ago: orange oak kitchen cabinets, vinyl flooring, wall-to-wall carpeting, mirrored walls—you get the idea.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we had a vision for the space, and given how smoothly my first renovation experience had gone, it was only natural that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25822#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we turned to Sweeten</a> again to help us find our contractor. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor we chose</a> was incredibly organized, professional, and had a very detailed quote, which we appreciated. Some contractors struck us as too hopeful with regard to project scope, while others were “doom-and-gloom” purveyors, finding calamity behind every piece of drywall. Our contractor tempered our enthusiasm by identifying challenges we didn’t see coming but never told us something couldn’t be done. He was attentive and imaginative.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I was leaving my recently renovated apartment to start our life together in Stamford, we needed to bring some of the modern city elements to the suburbs. One of the challenges was the large amount of space to be updated without having a huge budget. Since we had plans to grow into the space over time, we decided to focus on the areas we’d use the most—the first two floors and the master bathroom. We wanted the unit to feel current with our own choices but without ripping everything out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I worked really well together and collaborated on elements that were important to us. He pushed for the recessed lighting in the kitchen and dining room, whereas I was excited about the engineered floor and spent weeks reviewing my selection. Believe it or not, I found the flooring company on a deep-dive on Instagram. There were no local distributors or showrooms, but I was able to track down a salesperson in Texas who helped me select the material remotely. When it arrived, I knew it was the best decision; it really transformed the space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, we knew the wall-to-wall carpet on the first two floors would be replaced with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered hardwood</a>. The kitchen cabinets would be repainted and new appliances added. We increased the kitchen storage and functionality by adding the Simple Human under-sink trash and recycling bins. Roll-out chrome baskets held strainers and cleaning supplies and pot lids sat on racks.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding a bill-paying station/drop zone just outside the kitchen made a big difference. It used to be an extra kitchen cabinet. But in order to make the space work for us, I knew we needed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work area</a> that wasn’t the dining room table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the master bedroom, we added California Closets to maximize the space. The closets had an odd layout, so a custom system enabled us to design it to fit our needs. The master bath was refreshed with new tile and fixtures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An entryway on the lower level from the garage leads you to our gym. Our Sweeten contractor worked incredibly hard on these stairs after the carpeting was removed. He showed his skills laying down the plank, nosing, and risers, especially with the corners and angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A home gym/multipurpose room was created on the lower level. Our contractor covered the concrete floor with a specific floor paint as a moisture barrier and then laid down interlocking foam floor tiles. They were more cost-effective and functional than continuing the engineered wood into this space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every renovation has its ups and downs. In this one, we kept discovering water damage! When we bought the condo, it had a musty smell, so we knew we were going to find some sort of water issue, but I don’t think we realized how much. The previous owners just covered up rotten subfloor with new carpeting in multiple places. And when they decided the lower level needed a closet, they just framed it out right on top of the shag! So it proved comical when we tried to remove the old carpet and found ourselves using pliers to get every last bit of remnant out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor and his team worked late into the evenings and on many weekends to keep up with our scheduled move-in date. Unfortunately, our flooring got delayed, and that held him up, but he was proactive and able to work on other projects in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that the renovation is complete, we learned it will always take longer than you had hoped, but in the end, it’s all worth it. Make all of your design selections in advance of starting construction. You can cut down on costs by taking on some of the work yourself, but there’s a reason why professional contractors stay in business. They quickly finished what would have been gargantuan tasks to amateurs like us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and I love our new space. Friends and family come over and are so impressed with the transformation. My second Sweeten renovation went as well as my first, and I think it speaks to the company and the quality contractors that are in the Sweeten network.</p>
<p><em>Lauren and Austin, thanks for showing us your updated townhouse—and for being repeat customers! We love &#8220;serial renovators&#8221;!</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our first installment of a series in which I hope to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating. We hear your questions every day and work happily to bring you answers through our team and blog. Whether you&#8217;re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings a new set of circumstances and new queries with it. Feel free to email me at JBrownhill@sweeten.com. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll even include questions that I get asked most often—even at cocktail parties!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, our question is about brownstones, and if this topic interests you, be sure to check out Part 1 of Nazli&#8217;s post on her and her husband Larry&#8217;s full gut four-story townhouse reno, a story filled with helpful insights and a refreshingly candid take on their experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QUESTION: What should homeowners keep in mind before jumping into a brownstone renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN:</strong> I think most people get really excited about the interiors, especially as New Yorkers. We’re used to mostly having apartments or spaces where we are pretty much focused only on the interior. But the big change comes when you go from a regular apartment renovation to a brownstone renovation or an actual piece of property, and you’re still tempted to focus on the interiors. After all, that’s where it’s going to be fun&#8230;that’s where you’re going to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I highly recommend people fall in love with all the details of their roof, and all the details of their basement—places where apartment dwellers usually rely on a super and don&#8217;t ever have to worry. So when you’re thinking about a brownstone renovation, really look at the integrity of the roof and the integrity of the basement. Those are the areas you want to get right before you even start on the interiors. Every time it rains, you don&#8217;t want your heart skipping a beat wondering if your roof is leaking. Or if it&#8217;s raining hard, you don&#8217;t want to be stressed out worrying, &#8220;Oh my god, is my basement flooding?&#8221; So fall in love with the roof and the basement. Because that’s really the difference. Yes, you’re getting a ton more space, and yes, you’re getting a backyard, but start at the top and the bottom.</p>

<p>Jerry and Janet&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historic brownstone</a> needed major work, including a facelift of the building&#8217;s exterior, so they turned to a gut renovation with the goal of creating the perfect mix of old and new.</p>
