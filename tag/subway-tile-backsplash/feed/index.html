			<h2>From wide-plank to herringbone, these popular hardwood floor patterns spice up any home</h2>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovation by Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of using hardwood for flooring in homes dates back hundreds of years. Up to today, the material has proven to remain steadfast through time and trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose geometric shapes like herringbone or chevron, or wide plank versus classic width, it anchors the whole home. Typically installed throughout, wood floors cover a large square footage. It has a substantial impact on your home&#8217;s personality and design style. No surprise, then, the perennial wood floor is often chosen for its unifying qualities and timelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Sweeten renovators show how their hardwood floor ideas added to their home overall. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A herringbone wood floor in Crown Heights</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg" alt="Cafe style dining area next to the door leading to the roof deck" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43646" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s1">Janet and Jerry</span><span class="s2"> lived on Long Island but bought <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a multi-story fixer-upper in Brooklyn</a> as an investment property. Plus, it serves as a place to stay when they work late in the city. They updated the townhouse, keeping the small fourth floor as their own. For their one-bedroom unit, the goal was to create an open, airy studio. One of their pressing challenges was the hardwood floors. They were covered by old vinyl and carpeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They chose white-oak flooring that would be custom laid in a herringbone pattern. Unfortunately, the lead time was two months just to get the wood custom cut. So, they adjusted their plans and found a pre-cut herringbone wood floor that could be installed quickly. Their quick fix became a beautiful solution.</span></p>
<h3>Herringbone pattern wood enriches a kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25566" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Nazli and Larry<a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span class="s2">, updating their historic Brooklyn brownstone</span></a> was a labor of love. They wanted to merge modern and traditional styles. The challenge wa</span><span class="s1">s how to do so within the townhouse’s long and narrow dimensions. The couple also struggled between managing their budget and getting their absolute must-haves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, some things Nazli wouldn’t compromise on. One was the wood floors. They wanted to make a statement in the kitchen so they splurged on walnut and installed it as a herringbone pattern. It gives the kitchen a rich, finished look, which extends into the parlor. To stay within budget, they used a less expensive white oak for the upstairs—an area that sees much less traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro tip: There are a variety of wood floor species—all at varying price points. Oak, maple, and cherry are popular choices as well as bamboo, walnut, ash, and mahogany. Shop around to find the one that fits your budget and style.  </span></p>
<h3>Wide-plank wood flooring</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47439" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these Sweeten renovators, redoing </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Greenwich Village condo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included gutting the place and adding a second bedroom. The plan was to maximize their 16-foot ceilings to make the 850-square-foot space larger and more modern. They turned it into a gallery-like space with black steel accents contrasting bright white walls. They kept the finishes simple giving an airiness to the space. One major design detail that achieves this is the contemporary-looking wide-plank wood flooring in a neutral stain. The home became more open, expansive, and refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: By definition, a wide plank is wider than today’s standard 2½– to 4–inch boards. And they are believed by many to increase property value due to their current popularity and relatively expensive price.</span></p>
<h3>Wide plank flooring in white oak</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home was the reason for moving into their 1950s home in Los Angeles. Like a lot of people who found they needed a home office during the pandemic, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Kevin needed a larger space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the 1,538-square-foot house was perfect even if it was in need of a little TLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a Sweeten contractor to fix up the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. But first things first. They started by laying down new flooring throughout the house. “We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive,” says Amy. And a bonus: The lighter floors compliment the living room’s natural wood ceiling.</span></p>
<h3>Classic wood floors in a Westchester County compound</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors large windows and fireplace and track lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51202" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to Sweeten to help </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovate her client’s home in Harrison, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The homeowners wanted to turn the 1953 estate into a convenient, multi-generational gathering spot for their family. The home needed an overhaul of the kitchen and bathrooms. The renovation plans also called for a new 750-square-foot addition to act as a large family room. The look of the home is contemporary classic brought together by the beautiful white-oak classic wood floors seen throughout. The homeowners chose variegated coloring to create a sense of refreshed modernity with a nod to the classic.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: Variegated wood coloring and mixed-width patterns add versatility and work well with both classic and contemporary designs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27343 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen, renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Sarah-G_Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Brighten up a long, thin kitchen in Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: When Sarah and her husband bought their two-bedroom co-op in Prospect Heights, the plan was to renovate the kitchen soon after. Unfortunately, it turned out a coat closet shaped like a column that stood in the middle of the living room was built into the floor and worse, had all the electrical wiring for the home running through it (the building was built in 1907). Removing that and redoing the floors took priority. After three years, a DIY bathroom renovation, and a baby, the family felt ready to tackle the long, thin, and grim kitchen and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached out to Sweeten</a>, which matched them with vetted contractors. The floors were cracked and the cabinets covered in grunge, despite Sarah’s best bleaching efforts. The very-average oven couldn’t keep up with the growing family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <b>After</b></span>: The main goal of the renovation was a brighter kitchen, but there was only a small window to work with. That meant relying on a color scheme to do the job. “I think we would have gone more rustic if we had more light,” said Sarah. Rather than going with all white “that seemed a little much,” she said, they picked out a light gray for the cabinets. They pondered using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ikea</a> for the cabinets, but in the end, their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a> built them custom. The tall units that reached the ceiling made the kitchen feel bigger while adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage space</a>. The cabinet that allows the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microwave</a> to float provided storage without taking up floor space. <span class="s1">It was an ideal spot since they opted for a quality range hood rather than a microwave/hood combo. </span>For a family with two cooks, the kitchen is in operation most nights. The previous design had about a foot of usable counter space because of an awkwardly placed sink. There was some too-small-to-be-useful counter space to the left between sink and fridge, so their Sweeten contractor suggested shifting the sink. “It’s not centered, but it means we have over two feet of counter space,” said Sarah. “For us, it has just changed everything.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: Surviving with a microwave and takeout for most of the renovation turned out to be &#8220;kind of nice,” said Sarah. “It wasn’t as expensive as we thought it was going to be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">What did Miguel do when he moved into a boring white box he called home? He took creative control—the apartment, too had unexpected design finds!</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26634 mb-0 size-chrono" title="homeowner Miguel" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After living in the gritty and creative city of Berlin for several years, Miguel, a native New Yorker who works in the music industry, decided to move home. He searched for about nine months for an apartment with character, but in the end, settled for a one-bedroom in a 1950s co-op that he described as bland, cookie cutter, and a white box. At least the location was good—by the water in Cobble Hill. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his profile</a> and turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> banking on transforming the 700-square-foot apartment—this is his third renovation—into a unique home with custom closets. What he didn’t bet on was uncovering beautiful details the apartment had all along.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Did you renovate your apartment soon after the purchase or were you living in the space for a while?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I had it for about nine months. I lived on a mattress on the floor because I just moved back from ten years in Berlin, so I was really starting from scratch. Part of living in the apartment beforehand was to figure out what to do with it. You need to live in the space so you can see how it is going to function in different seasons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Where is the apartment and when was it built? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> It is by the water in Cobble Hill. The neighborhood is tree-lined and historically protected. The apartment is about 700 square feet and in a 1950s co-op. It looked like a cardboard box. It had absolutely no character, so one of the hardest things was to incorporate character. It was boxy with a kitchen, living room, and bedroom with no flow between the rooms. I opened up another part of the wall between the living room and bedroom, like a doorway, and now light from the bedroom window can spill out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>Did you know about the ceiling beams and exposed brick wall before you started the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> They were not planned at all. My contractor was fixing some electrical stuff and we found this beautiful brick wall behind there and then we found the beams. The beams and the brick walls were a game-changer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>How did you incorporate them into the renovation?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The brick wall in the living room was not so pretty so I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> it all white, but left the bedroom original. In this way, the texture continues from the living room to the bedroom in two different colors. The ceilings were not very high so I wanted to paint the beams. There was a lot of discussion with my Sweeten contractor about that. He didn’t want me to paint the beams, but we did in the end. It comes down to a personal taste thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26641 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26642 size-chrono" title="main living area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="custom closets" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What did you do with the floors? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> The floors were the original thin pine floorboards, but there was almost nothing underneath so they creaked. We put in a layer of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing</a> with an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">engineered wood floor</a> on top. The heat gets pretty hot here in NYC and wood expands and contracts which engineered wood handles better than solid wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: Was there anything else you did to add character?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> We added crown molding. The walls were literally just sheet rock and the window. Adding crown molding made the windows look bigger and gave them texture. Now, it is almost like a picture frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> <strong>What did you do about storage?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> I got rid of a wall of storage closets as you walk in. I made up for it by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building</a> two small, custom closets on either side of the entrance. This also created a small “entryway” which was missing, but I still needed more storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the same time, I had also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">door</a> for the new opening between the bedroom and living room. I thought about a glass door, but that didn’t feel right. I contacted a local millworker in Brooklyn and asked if a wardrobe could be put on rollers. They said the railings that it would roll on needed to be tight against the wall to stop it from toppling. It is kinda amazing. You never know if it is going to work out right, but it worked out perfectly. So now I have a way to close off the room AND a place to store my clothes and shoes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: The kitchen counter has a nice mix of materials. How did that come about? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> Another challenge was trying to find a dining table. I didn’t have room for one, but I had room for a kitchen counter. I decided to make a table out of a slab of walnut with hairpin steel legs as an extension of the counter. When guests come over, I can move it anywhere in the apartment as a standalone table. It also adds a nice segue to the living room. Above the other counter and range, I decided to keep open shelving. It makes the kitchen feel big as opposed to having a wall of cabinets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did your Sweeten help you? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Miguel:</strong> My contractor was really smooth. I loved that he was fair. There are always going to be mistakes on the contractor&#8217;s end and on mine.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh a 20-year-old studio kitchen with an updated feel</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 1998, when Jill first purchased her co-op studio apartment in Yorkville on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side, she made a few changes that she thought would improve the small kitchen design. In the 56-square-foot kitchen, she swapped a 20-inch stove (that had to be lit with a match!) for a 24-inch model and changed out the shelving for stock cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted storage capacity</a>. “I’m only 4’11” so I couldn’t reach most of the previous shelves,” Jill explained. It was perfectly adequate for nearly 20 years, but in 2016, she decided it was time for a refresh. The small kitchen had become outdated and Jill realized that she could customize it to better suit her lifestyle. She wanted to maintain some elements while changing others: the footprint would stay, as would the dimensions of the cabinetry. Almost everything else would receive a facelift—the floors, the countertops, the tile, all the appliances and fixtures, and the cabinetry itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Jill found Sweeten’s blog through Apartment Therapy’s <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/renovation-diary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovation Diary</a> series. She decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post her project</a> after a few failed attempts at finding a contractor on her own and was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>. Looking through other kitchen reno projects sparked a desire to add a custom pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spice rack</a>, but when her mother exclaimed: “How many spices do you even really have?” Jill reflected on this question (“…about 3 or 4?”) and concluded it would not be a good use of her limited space. Similarly, she had been advised by friends to choose a deep sink—something that seems to be universally desirable. But she realized, after using one in another apartment, that it wasn&#8217;t ideal for her shorter frame since she had to reach further in for the pots and dishes. Jill points out, “With renovations, you have to design for the reality of your life, rather than how you imagine it can be.” Jill took her own advice for the rest of the choices: clean, flat-front <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinetry</a> in Wickham Gray by Benjamin Moore, a classic subway tile in glass for a modern twist, and a dark quartz countertop that paired well with the gray, wood-grain porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor tile</a>. Pots and pans, as well as a knife rack, went on the wall opposite the cabinets. For appliances, she went with stainless steel models that were <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly smaller</a> than her originals. With the stove, she went back to a 20-inch model. “You wouldn’t think that four inches of counter space would make such a big difference, but it does!” Jill also removed a shelf above the stove and added a circulating exhaust <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vent</a>. Forgoing a dishwasher was a no-brainer since she was happy to hand-wash and preferred the storage space instead. Lastly, for her refrigerator, she chose a stainless steel counter-depth model so that it wouldn’t jut out into the entrance to her kitchen. All the elements came together for a classic but understated look that Jill will be happy with for years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Even though the footprint of the small kitchen design stayed the same, Jill gained a lot of extra storage with custom cabinets that made use of previously “dead” corners. She chose glass-front upper cabinets in the corner, which are fully accessible (with the help of a step stool), as well as bi-level Lazy Susan in the lower corner cabinet. Above her fridge, her Sweeten contractor added a custom shelf for her baking pans. And below the not-too-deep sink, the contractor installed a partition that is a perfect fit for her step stool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a new contender in the tiny urban kitchen competition! </span><strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/annes-sweetened-willow-street-kitchen-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A half galley in Brooklyn Heights</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has held the honor up to this point, but a 25-square-foot Upper East Side kitchen looks like it might edge out all competitors. With an eye on re-sale value, the owner of this Manhattan studio came to Sweeten to make the most of a small space with new finishes and a delightfully scrappy use of modern materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-tiny-kitchen-gets-a-big-makeover-sweeten-on-the-upper-east-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18265" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/catherine-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<span id="more-18251"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i>“My contractor made my kitchen renovation a painless experience. He has an excellent eye for design and materials and is willing to work with your budget. His brother and the rest of the renovation team are incredibly hard-working and left the work site immaculate at the end of every day.”</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><i><i>&#8211; Upper East Side homeowner</i></i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After settling into her studio apartment in the Yorkville section of New York’s posh Upper East Side, this new homeowner saw opportunity in what felt like a “disaster”. The kitchen floor and subfloor were cracked, appliances were dated, the small sink and stove had no backsplash protection, and the nook was starting to look as if it hadn’t been cleaned in years. The tiny L-shaped kitchen soon became the main focal point for a makeover. Set on keeping the project within a specific budget, the studio’s owner </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project to Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we matched her with a Sweeten general contractor</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a contractor with two decades of experience helping homeowners achieve quality renovations at every budget. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18264" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="797" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Catherine_Kitchen-Before-01-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project post called for some specifics and laid out a few materials to avoid: yes to new white cabinets, Caesarstone counters, and subway tile, and no to floor grout that would attract grime. Her contractor got to work right away, removing all of the existing kitchen finishes to make way for more modern selects&#8211;without having to change the footprint. Charcoal-hued porcelain floor tiles replaced every bit of the dingy, broken originals, setting the tone for chic black and white all around. The original cabinets were torn out to make way for more modern Shaker-style white cabinets, maximizing additional storage space and finished with brushed silver metal pulls. The laminate countertops were swapped for a more luxe black Caesarstone with a stainless undermount sink and coordinating faucet that mimics the modernity of the cabinet hardware. The Sweeten contractor installed a gleaming subway tile backsplash in black glass, and crisp white paint brightens up the new space. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The studio’s owner went for stainless appliances in lieu of the older white originals, and she particularly wanted a vented hood for the oven range. The contractor saw to it that these accessories were incorporated in the design. A sleek new fridge took the place of the former, plus a gas range, coordinating hood, and a compact microwave right above it&#8212;a much better location than before when the microwave was oddly stuck between the fridge and sink. With contrasting black and white throughout the new space, and alternating matte and glossy surfaces, the new lighting pendant casts a gorgeous glow.</p>
