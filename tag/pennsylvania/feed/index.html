<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refinish a basement in Ardmore, Philadelphia</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When David and Wendy bought their 2,700-square-foot home in a Philadelphia suburb, one thing was for sure: the smelly, dated basement had to go. David completely demoed it with every intention of refinishing it after they moved in. Two years later and the basement had become a storage room instead of the recreational space for “serious TV watching,” an exercise area, and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/">bar</a> that he’d hoped to create. &#8220;I never got around to it, though, and finally hired someone through Sweeten,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35324 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35324 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-723x933.jpg" alt="floor plan, basement renovation, home renovation, design, basement renovation before and after" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-232x300.jpg 232w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-Floorplan-600x774.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Ready to take on the unfinished basement once and for all, David <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> on Sweeten and chose this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Since he’d already completed the demolition, they hit the ground running and kept his main goal of having a &#8220;dedicated space for TV-watching where [he] didn&#8217;t have to worry about large speakers ruining the decor.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, they had to determine how to best lay out the basement to meet his multi-purpose needs. A cousin who owns the interior design firm <a href="https://lkdesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LK Design</a> helped David figure out where to position the bar, fitness equipment, and the entertainment seating. Coming down the stairs from the main floor, the exercise area was set up directly to the right and away from the main living space. The bar and mini kitchen open conveniently to the seating area for easy access. Low ductwork presented a great spot to place the cabinetry and sink, and to maximize headspace as much as possible, they placed the bar directly under an exposed steel beam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for finishing touches, they outfitted the theater with plush carpeting for optimal comfort. For the remainder of the flooring, David decided on more durable (plus pet- and kid-friendly!) vinyl plank. The kitchen and bar got a luxe touch with granite <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, gray cabinets, and chrome hardware.<br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35322 noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-David-Roberts-BaseTheater-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-35316 noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-area-granite-countertop" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48564 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg" alt="Kitchen area with sink under grantite countertop and gray cabinetry after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Overall the biggest challenge (aside from determining the layout) was getting the bar sink installed below the sewer line. Fortunately, a plumber found a solution and installed a pump. Their Sweeten general contractor also provided invaluable assistance getting a full-size refrigerator down the narrow staircase, not to mention handling a few issues with vendors and navigating delays. &#8220;We had gas lines in the way of the ceiling, and he had a plumber who was able to reroute the lines in a very cost-effective way. Previous plumbers I had found only suggested much more expensive solutions,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thinking ahead, they also prepared for possible wiring needs down the line and “future-proofed” throughout the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does the family feel about their new hangout space? &#8220;Comfortable and relaxed,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="low-white-ceiling-blue-walls" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48569 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg" alt="Low white ceiling with blue walls in the entertainment room and fitness equipment after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/David-Basement-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: David and the contractor installed built-in cabinets in the corners of the entertaining area to hide the gas meters.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Carpeting: <a href="https://www.mohawkflooring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohawk</a>. Lifeproof vinyl plank flooring: <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Vinyl-Flooring-Vinyl-Plank-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbzjz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Cabinets, cabinet fronts, faucet: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikea</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-basement-turns-into-family-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiana and her husband</a> took advantage of valuable square footage and turned their basement into a multi-purpose space complete with a family room, wine storage, and laundry area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel and Eric&#8217;s kitchen</a> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine cooking in your new kitchen for the first time&#8230;the style! The smart layout! The shiny new appliances and lovely lighting! The team at Sweeten is inspired daily by our clients’ posts describing their renovation dreams, and the best place to start the process is with a realistic budget. Sweeten&#8217;s guide will help you learn what to expect for kitchen renovation costs.</p>
<h3>Average kitchen renovation costs in the U.S.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The national average for a basic kitchen renovation is <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22,000</a> and swings up to about $60,000 for a major overhaul. What if your desires exceed your bank account? Tweaking the budget so your project comes within your price range while maintaining quality begins with understanding the cost breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29080 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen design costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association&#8217;s (NKBA) estimates design fees will comprise about four percent of your budget. Although this percentage could grow. For example, a kitchen designer in NYC might cost 15 percent of that budget, says <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, a Sweeten designer. The NKBA also found that only 22 percent of homeowners renovating a kitchen or a bathroom actually hired a designer. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just remember that your design will play a big role in the end budget. If you’re dreaming of a layout change that involves moving load-bearing walls and gas lines, take into account the additional paperwork, inspections, and fees later on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Appliances</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more you value your cooking skills, the sooner you should make your budget decisions in this category. “If the client falls in love with a 48-inch range, the designer can fit that into the design,” explains Jace Kieffer from <a href="https://www.kieffers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieffer’s Appliances</a> in Lansdale, PA. Your appliance and ventilation choices may impact the design, he adds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a starter home, a basic four-appliance kitchen set—range, fridge, microwave and dishwasher—costs around $2,000. However, if you’re renovating a kitchen, it’s likely you will want to upgrade to at least premium economy appliances. They cost between $4,000 and $5,000 and have a life expectancy of about seven years. Luxury brands will set you back at least $12,000, a cost that should be weighed against their 15-year life expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the country, you’re unlikely to see much variation in the cost of luxury appliances. That’s because manufacturers often put minimum price restrictions on their appliances (sorry, no Black Friday deals here). If you’re happy with a lower grade, it might be worth shopping around for a sweeter price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like appliances, it is helpful to factor ventilation into the plans early. A basic over-the-range hood that leaves room for the microwave goes for around $300. A standalone hood from a premium economy brand costs $500 or more. A luxury brand might set you back about $2,000. Customs hoods from a metal fabricator can cost upwards of $10,000, Jace said. You also need to plan for ducting, which a general contractor usually takes care of.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest investment of your kitchen renovation will likely be cabinetry and hardware (such as handles and knobs)&#8211;this category typically makes up about 30 percent of budgets. A big factor in pricing will be your preference for custom or pre-fabricated cabinets from stores like Home Depot and IKEA. Stock cabinets average out at about $130 for a linear foot. For a custom job, the price might be as much as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear foot</a>. Custom cabinets will give you greater freedom when deciding your kitchen layout and finished look. It could also get you <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a>. Don’t forget that these cabinets must be installed and that will likely be an additional cost. See more on labor and installation below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Countertops</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an area where you can scrimp or splurge, depending on your priorities. Countertops can start at $5 per square foot for a butcher’s block or laminate, a synthetic material. A low-end quartz could cost about $50 a square foot and a marble around $60 a square foot. Something more pricey such as granite could cost as much as $100 a square foot. Don’t forget to factor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>, which is the wall area between the countertop and cabinets. That could range from $3 a square foot to $35.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costs for Kitchen Floors</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Flooring will represent 7 percent of an average budget, or about $1,400, according to the NKBA. Concrete or vinyl flooring are economical choices and can look cool along with being easy to clean. Stone or wood flooring are higher-end options. Keep in mind that new base cabinets that are a different depth than your original may expose old and mismatched flooring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lighting in the kitchen</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is generally a lower-spend category. In a $20,000 budget, lighting materials usually come in at about $800. Again, this will move up or down depending on your tastes. Besides ventilation, those remodeling their kitchens spent the least on lighting, according to the NKBA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen plumbing costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like everything else in renovating, your vision and choices will have a big impact on kitchen plumbing costs. On an average remodel, plumbing materials will match lighting expenses at about $800. If you’re considering that layout change then plumbing and gas lines may have to move. That will lead to the added costs in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting and inspections.</p>
<h3><b>Kitchen remodel labor and installation costs</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the renovation site—leveling tilted floors, replacing the sheetrock, etc.—can cost a few thousand dollars. Add to that installation of appliances and cabinetry, plumbing and electrical, which could take about 17 percent of your total budget or almost $3,500 on an average kitchen renovation. It’s worth pointing out that labor costs can change based on geography. New York City is the most expensive. Chicago’s labor costs are on average about 18 percent cheaper, according to RSMeans data. Philadelphia is a few percentage points lower at about 21 percent and LA sits at more than 30 percent lower than New York. And check with your contractor if their fees cover permits. If not, that could add another $1,000 or two.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting a budget can be overwhelming with the cost of all these separate items. The good news is renovations are an investment. For example, a $62,000 investment in a kitchen <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could see</a> a $40,000 increase in resale value on the home, according to Remodeling Magazine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that also increases the value of your property for taxation purposes. In Philadelphia, home improvements can get a <a href="https://www.biaofphiladelphia.com/tax-abatement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax abatement</a>. The value your new kitchen adds to your home will not be taxed for 10 years, said Marianne Scott from the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia. Similar programs exist in many other cities such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/community-development/housing-assistance/residential-property-tax-abatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cincinnati</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, no two renovations and their budgets are the same. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator allocated their $25,000 kitchen renovation budget:</p>
