										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>An Australian chef opens up for coffee lovers</h3>
<p><em>With an opportunity to make a mark in NYC, Eliot, an Australian chef, opens his first café stateside. The 175-square-foot space he found in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea was disheveled and in need of a makeover. He came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting renovators with vetted general contractors, and found a contractor who would transform it into an espresso and coffee shop with the feeling of an Aussie beachside.</em></p>

<p><strong>PROJECT:</strong> An entrepreneur opens his first storefront in NYC</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> 423 Ninth Avenue, Manhattan, New York</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Clovelly Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Clovelly is an extension of my love for the Australian café culture. We carefully select coffee cherries from around the world, which are roasted and brewed with love and passion. Our goal was to create a cozy space in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. Here, you can engage with your barista while enjoying a coffee from our weekly rotating menu of single-origin beans and pastries.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Clovelly Coffee is a café inspired by Clovelly, a Sydney beachside suburb and my Australian hometown.</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What led to the opening of this new brick-and-mortar space?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> After making the move to Manhattan with my wife, we quickly connected with this vibrant city and the New Yorkers who shared the love for coffee.</p>
<p>As a working chef in Sydney, I ran my first successful café for five years. Now in New York, Clovelly is a family-owned business and my second venture in continuing my passion for coffee and food with an Aussie edge.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new café design and the materials used represent your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> The design of the space has a distinct beach-y feel. The use of white evokes an Aussie beachside café feel with gold/brass finishes. By adding splashes of yellow and blue (pulling from the colorful textures found at Clovelly Beach), we recreated the golden sun and sand and the blue in the Pacific Ocean from our hometown.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Our contractor was instrumental in the process. They helped us find solutions in real-time and helped us stay on budget. They also offered alternatives to issues that arose.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a small space, we had challenges fitting in plumbing pipes. However, by making adjustments to walls and getting creative with the direction of the pipes, we were able to make it all fit.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Sweeten kept in contact with me throughout the process. We reached out to them whenever we needed extra advice or guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help entrepreneurial business owners like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> They are experts at connecting you with a contractor who is the right fit for you. They also help you interpret quotes so you can make this crucial decision.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Can you describe the “before” space?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> It was damaged and messy, including cracks in the floor tiles.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What’s next for the brand?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> We j<span class="s1">ust launched a catering menu, with a selection of artisan pastries and freshly brewed coffee.</span> I&#8217;m also looking to add a second location with seating.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36785" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04.jpg" alt="Union Square play, commercial renovation, design, construction, remodel, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Anthony-Rudolf-UnionSquarePlay-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/union-square-play-commercial-property-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A playspace renovation</a> in Union Square by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Piotr</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>The professional team you put together is key to the success of building your business space. Here are guidelines on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with a general contractor</a>.</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

They turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> for a general contractor with the expertise and communication skills they were looking for. With the right lighting and a bright fresh remodel, the partners bring baby socializing to the next level.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What is Union Square Play?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Union Square Play is a place for local families. We both have kids and have been in New York for a long time. We wanted to have a space where families could come with their three-year-olds and under—a place to play, take classes, and get out of the weather.</p>

<p><strong>Sandra:</strong> When we opened the play space, it was a result of us having children of our own and living in a neighborhood to find that what was out there wasn&#8217;t perfect for us. So we really built it for ourselves. You could drop in for classes, engage with other parents and other children, and most importantly it’s a place where children could be in a space that was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong>  How did your Sweeten general contractor help you realize your vision?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> The ceilings aren&#8217;t super high but we knew that making it all white and beautiful would make it feel safe, home-y and just, useable. That was really the biggest thing for us. We worked with the bones of the space and didn&#8217;t do major architectural structural changes. Our contractor allowed us to brighten everything up and make it feel fresh. He came in on budget, which was hugely important.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How did you come to Sweeten? Did you work with Client Services?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was our first time using the Sweeten platform. I had a contractor I used exclusively on four or five spaces that I&#8217;ve built out in the past. He came a little over [budget] from what I was hoping to pay to build out [this play space]. So I said, “Okay, let&#8217;s give Sweeten a try and see if we can find a new contractor.” Early on, Client Services helped us with the process. We got five or six bids in, they helped us with the proper timing and decision process, and when to go back and bid for more. Once we selected our Sweeten contractor, it was smooth sailing from there.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten could help other entrepreneurs like yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra: </strong>I think this process can be really intimidating. If you&#8217;ve never done a build out before, or even if you have, every project is different, and if you don&#8217;t have a super tight relationship with the contractor, or even if you do, you are always trying to figure out, “Am I getting charged properly?” “What&#8217;s the timeline supposed to be?” “What&#8217;s realistic or not?” With a platform like Sweeten, you get to compare different bids, get a feel for contractors&#8217; past work and budget, and what&#8217;s feeling out of my comfort zone or what’s feeling on point?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> It was also just getting to meet as many people as we got to meet through the platform; I think in one day we had eight people come through, which was just insane. The amount of effort it would take you to find, source, and schedule eight appointments is a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten:</strong> What was important for you to find in a general contractor?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Communication style and having good camaraderie. The relationship is critically important. I think that&#8217;s where our Sweeten contractor thrived. On the commercial side, there is typically capital investment that needs to get a return and every dollar counts. So we needed to get [to the end of the renovation] as fast as possible to start making money and start paying it back. We needed to do it as efficiently as possible. Not only was the contractor on site and knew the light fixtures and the nuts and bolts, but his partner was office-based and was our main point of contact where we were able to go back and forth. Things not only moved faster, but stayed on budget and we got the paperwork through very quickly.</p>
