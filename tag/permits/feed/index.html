<h2 class="p1">Key factors to convert a garage into living space: costs, climate control, property value &amp; local zoning</h2>
<p class="p3"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49341" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5.jpg" alt="Garage renovation" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Garage-Door-11.5-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katy&#8217;s garage conversion</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">into an indoor-outdoor room</span></p>
<p>Increasingly, garages in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are morphing into multi-use spaces. To homeowners, these garage spaces are blank canvases and are morphing into anything from self-contained units to home offices. If you&#8217;re wondering how to convert your garage into a living space, there are some details you&#8217;ll need to gather first.</p>
<p>At Sweeten, we’re here to help you flip that underutilized garage into one of the best rooms in the house or perhaps an income-generating unit. Before you take on turning a garage into living space, like a home gym or guest house, there are things to consider. Does the space have proper insulation?</p>
<p>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</p>
<h3>Garage remodel ideas</h3>
<p>Anything. Really! Garages have been converted into gyms, personal getaway space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-contained studio apartments</a>, and home bars, according to Sweeten general contractor Michael. “It’s found space, so get creative,” Michael said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg" alt="one part of two car detached garage converted to room and sectional door replaced with see through glass doors during renovation" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone wp-image-50920 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63223-Samantha-Garage-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) With Sweeten&#8217;s help, a 150-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-connecticut-garage-renovation-creates-an-art-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage remodel</a> in Connecticut became a ceramics studio</span></p>
<h3>Should you trade in car storage space for a garage remodel?</h3>
<p class="p3">While some people are giving up their car’s indoor space altogether, others are slicing their garage in half, said Michael. This leaves room for at least one car, and the rest of the space becomes something else. “That way you can still have a garage when you sell your house,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">Michael believes the jury is still out on if the property value increases whether the garage is converted or not. Some Sweeten contractors believe a garage is much more valuable as a living space for the homeowner and for resale purposes. <a href="https://budgeting.thenest.com/making-room-garage-affect-home-value-31778.html"><span class="s2">Reports indicate that a home&#8217;s</span></a> value could increase by as much as six percent, but that’s only if the area has ample street parking. Taking away your garage and off-street parking in a high-density area could bring that value down.</p>
<p class="p3">However, some towns might require at least one car space on your property and potentially two in some areas, Michael said. This could mean slotting your car into an outdoor area somewhere else in your front yard. “Do your homework,” Michael said. More on zoning and permits below.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to convert a garage into living space?</h3>
<p class="p3">Budgets for a garage renovation can vary greatly depending on many factors including the state of your garage, your intended use, and the types of materials you want to use. To get an accurate read on your budgets, it’s always best to sit down with a general contractor who can tailor a quote for your situation.</p>
<p class="p3">Converting a garage is a good-value strategy to add living space to your home, costing <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/money/real-estate/2017/02/10/renovating-garage-less-costly-option-than-addition/97742930/"><span class="s2">$30 a square foot</span></a> which is less than an extension, according to NorthJersey.com. Sweeten contractor Michael puts the average range of a garage conversion in the tri-state area between $35,000 and $60,000. “But I’ve seen upwards of $100,000,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">The fit-out for a garage conversion shouldn’t cost more than $45,000 to make the space comfortable, Michael said. That includes plumbing for a toilet, insulation, and heating. However, “A lot of people are putting in bars and fridges, some cooking equipment, or cool decorative wall paneling,” he said. These are just a few examples of what can bump up the price tag.</p>
<p class="p3">A basic garage conversion project that another Sweeten contractor has worked on came in at $25,000. The homeowner wanted an art studio. To handle the new 25 lighting fixtures—art studios need a lot of light—the space required an electrical upgrade including a new breaker box. Insulation was also required so it was comfortable during the fall, spring, and summer. A heater was added for the winter.</p>
<p class="p3">For a $60,000 project in rural New Jersey, a homeowner wanted to add a fully self-contained apartment to the second story of their garage. That meant adding a kitchen and bathroom, which pushes up a budget substantially. Plumbing, electrical, an interior and exterior overhaul as well as reinforcing the exterior stairs were part of the remodel.</p>
<p class="p3">The budget might seem big, but it was an income-generating investment bringing in rental income at $1,400 a month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage remodel in los angeles with sofa and office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52349 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Saima and Tom&#8217;s Sweeten contractor completed their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage conversion in Los Angeles</a></span></p>
<h3>What are the conditions of the garage?</h3>
<p class="p3">Sometimes, you&#8217;ll need to clear those spaces out from junk and any animal tenants. Many underutilized garages, especially standalone structures, may have experienced neglect for a period of time.</p>
<p class="p3">Whether a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand-alone garage is structurally sound</a> will also be a question. This will take on additional importance if you’re renovating or adding a second story.</p>
<p class="p3">Garages can also have random and awkwardly placed columns disrupting the open space, or a ceiling height that isn’t conducive to taller guests. And most floors will be on a pitch so water can run right off it, according to Michael. These are the types of problems that might require a creative solution if you’re going to convert your garage into a living space.</p>
<h3>Consider: Insulation and heating a garage remodel</h3>
<p class="p3">Most garages lack insulation. Consequently, it probably won&#8217;t have heating; so consider what you want to use the space for. If it will be used just for the summer, adding some fans can offer a budget-conscious idea.</p>
<p class="p3">If you’re intending to use it all or most of the year, you will likely need to add insulation and heating in your garage conversion. Typically, garages are made of concrete blocks, so they tend to be very cold. However, a garage that is within your home might have some insulation on any wall or part of the ceiling that connects to the main house.</p>
<p class="p3">Giving the room its own heat source will cost up to $6,000. Keep in mind that a heat pump might require an electrical upgrade. “You can take an existing heat system in the house and blow it into the garage,” said Michael, of one possible solution.</p>
<p class="p3">The floor of a garage is typically concrete and a big source of heat loss. Adding insulation might be necessary. If that’s the case, you will need to dig down or elevate the floor if your ceiling height allows for that, Michael said.</p>
<h3>Zoning and permits needed to convert a garage into living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Unfortunately, zoning rules can get in the way of a garage conversion. This is because changing the use of your garage can be a big deal for some building departments. “Some zoning codes prohibit adding a loft or a second story,” said Michael. The best way forward is to talk with your general contractor to find out what rules your local area might have.</p>
<p class="p3">According to Sweeten contractors, the cost of permits will also change from area to area with a range from a few hundred dollars up to <span class="s2">$1,500</span> if you need permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3">“Home Owners Associations often frown on these conversions,” Michael added. That’s because you will be taking away a car (or two) which might have been a vital part of that development’s original approval he said. If your home comes under an HOA, make sure to check their rules! It&#8217;s also wise to check the zoning and permitting restrictions in your area.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask when turning a garage into a living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, homeowners interested in turning a garage into a living space should do some soul searching first. How much will it improve your quality of life? Will you rent it? How will it impact your property’s value? For many, a garage is worth more as a living space than it is as car storage. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your garage or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

<p>Whether your Phoenix home is a contemporary, mid-century modern, Spanish mission, or anything else, a renovation is your ticket to making your home your own. The first step on that journey is to estimate costs to expect for your Phoenix renovation project.</p>
<p>Sweeten offers this Phoenix renovation cost guide as a jumping-off point to help start your project. It gives you a general idea of what major renovations costs to plan for; from the kitchen to bathroom to outdoor hardscaping.</p>
<p>The keyword, though, is <em>general</em>. Every home is unique, and every homeowner differs in their tastes, so no two budgets will be the same. Sweeten contractors will want to sit down with you and inspect your home to reach an accurate number.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of costs for some standard renovation projects in Phoenix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gut renovation: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$75</strong>—<strong>$100</strong> per square foot (psf)</li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$15,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$25,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at&nbsp; <strong>$45,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></li>
<li>Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$10,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$570</strong> psf.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel and extension: Starting at <strong>$40,000</strong></li>
<li>Adding hardscaping/pavers: Starts at <strong>$30</strong> psf</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phoenix home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>A total gut renovation in Phoenix (bringing your home down to its bare bones and remodels it to your liking,) starts at <strong>$75</strong>—<strong>$100</strong> psf for a home with budget finishes. This means installing materials such as laminate flooring and countertops, value-brand appliances, and basic tiles from big box stores like Home Depot. These scenarios, however, are dependent on the scope of work and existing conditions.</p>
<p>Although a gut renovation is a big project, consider doing it all at once— this saves money and is more efficient.&nbsp; You’ll also have your dream home much quicker than renovating room by room.</p>
<h3>How much a Phoenix kitchen remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget kitchen in Phoenix will typically start at <strong>$15,000</strong>. To achieve this price, a rip-and-replace will keep the layout the same—oven, sink, dishwasher—to avoid the added cost of new plumbing and gas lines. You should also look for prefabricated cabinets, and shop for value appliances, tiles, countertops, and faucets at big box stores.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For a mid-grade kitchen in Phoenix, expect the starting costs to be between <strong>$25,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong>. According to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s Cost vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/mountain/phoenix-az/">report</a>, the average mid-grade project comes in at around <strong>$65,000</strong>. More than half of that —60 percent—is a return on investment adding to your home’s value.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a kitchen at this budget, you can remodel a 200-square-foot space with semi-custom cabinets, a stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet, and shop around for a budget quartz countertop. You could also <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a kitchen island</a>, but the layout of anything involving a pipe or electrical wire will need to stay the same to keep costs down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A high-end kitchen renovation starts between <strong>$45,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong> while, according to the Cost Vs Value report, the average budget renovation comes in at over <strong>$132,000</strong>. Over 60 percent of that is added to your home’s value. At this level, you can go for the big-ticket item of custom cabinetry (which could take up half that budget!) You can also consider high-grade stone countertops, a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood, imported tiles, designer faucets, and a built-in water filtration system.</li>
</ul>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48186 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GRAPH-3-1-600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>How much a Phoenix bathroom remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget bathroom in Phoenix typically costs between <strong>$10,000</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong>. Like kitchens, the best way to achieve a value budget is by keeping the layout the same. Plumbing fixtures remain in the same location. Limit your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/measure-for-bathroom-tile-accurately-what-youll-need-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use of tiles to the floor</a> and to part of the wall (rather than from floor to ceiling). Shopping for your materials at big box stores will also keep your budget low.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A mid-grade bathroom costs around <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$570</strong> psf for something around the 35 square foot mark, according to the Cost Vs Value report. You could purchase a porcelain-on-steel bathtub and ceramic tiles. There’s also the option of a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. Changes to the layout or plumbing will add to the budget. A project like this will add close to <strong>$14,000, </strong>or almost 70 percent of the budget to your home’s value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Expect a high-end bathroom to start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. The average budget for a high-end bathroom comes in around <strong>$63,000</strong> for Phoenix or <strong>$630</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/mountain/phoenix-az/">report</a>. That includes an expansion from 35 square feet to 100 square feet. The new bathroom can have features like a freestanding soaker tub. You can have a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. Your budget can also afford a double sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hardscaping for the outdoors</h3>
<p>Phoenix is a great outdoor city in the fall, winter, and spring. With a few bells and whistles—like misters, fans, and shade—summer outdoor living is possible too. Adding or renovating hardscaping such as patio floors, retaining walls, and pavers starting at <strong>$30</strong> psf.</p>
<h3>Permit costs in Phoenix</h3>
<p>Different counties and towns around Phoenix have different fee schedules. Fees are often calculated by the total cost of the project or the size (square footage).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gilacountyaz.gov/2020Building/FEESCHEDULE%2012-2019.pdf">Fees</a> in Gila County are tied to the cost of the project. For example, a project with a budget of <strong>$60,000</strong> will cost a little over <strong>$700</strong> in permitting fees. A project that is <strong>$20,000</strong> will cost about <strong>$320</strong> in fees. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits each start at <strong>$25</strong>.</p>
<p>In Maricopa County, <a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6576/List-of-Initial-Fees-by-Permit-Type-PDF?bidId=">fees</a> for additions or alterations start at <strong>$110</strong>. If your project involves electrical, plumbing, or mechanical then it will attract at least another <strong>$60</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">How to set realistic expectations on your client</span><span class="s1"> renovation timelines</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47786 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Talk-Clients-Reno-Timeline-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A speedy construction schedule might seem like the key to happy clients, but realistic expectations may actually be more important in getting to<span class="s1"> the finish line. Sweeten often hears questions and concerns about construction schedules, so we&#8217;re sharing what we’ve learned so you, the contractor, can help clients better understand the moving pieces in a renovation. Sweeten has also shared with blog readers <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/common-renovation-delays-how-to-prepare-for-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most common renovation delays</a> and the actions they can take to be prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness, and appropriate budget. Contractors pay only when they win a project. Budgets start at $15,000 and average over $67,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">The Start Date Gamble</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, everything would be on-site before work starts. But who has room to store a new kitchen for two months before demolition begins? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting a project before everything is delivered is a risk that everyone takes. Help your client see this as a reasonable gamble. </span><span class="s1">One that comes with the benefit of speed and the risk of future delay. Make sure you’re both comfortable with the same bet: that project progress and material delivery will depend on each other down the road.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Talk to Clients about Major Renovation Milestones</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Clients often ask, “When will this project be done?”  </span><span class="s2">That question can be tough to answer before the work starts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guide your client to think about major milestones in the project, like:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Target start &#8211;</b>&#8211; <i>Will approvals, design decisions, and other prep needs (like temporary accommodations) affect the date?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Demolition &#8212; </b><i>How long will it take and what might be hidden under floors and behind walls?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Electrical, plumbing, and specialized trades &#8212;</b> <i>Will you need to work with someone else’s schedule and availability?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Inspections &#8212;</b> <i>Will progress pause for inspections?</i><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Finish work &#8212; </b><i>Will materials be available on time?</i><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s always helpful for clients to hear how long a project generally takes from start to finish, so feel free to estimate by days or weeks. But keeping the focus on start date range, major milestones, and potential variables will help your client feel more prepared for what is to come.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Handling Client Expectations for Renovation Surprises</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind the walls until you&#8217;re hired and work can begin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss with the homeowner the worst-case scenario based on the building&#8217;s age and history. Will there be issues with the electrical, plumbing, or structure? Let them know if they should prepare for contingencies in their budget. You won&#8217;t be able to price out every possible surprise but communicate with the homeowner how you will problem-solve when hurdles arise.</p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"> Fitting Subcontractors, Crew, and Inspector Schedules into Client Timelines</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten clients are often surprised by downtime once the project starts. They think of a project as moving in a straight line. Also, they may believe you have total control over the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure they aren’t wondering where your crew is! </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Help them understand that some steps depend on sub or vendor scheduling.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Talk to them about how inspections need to be scheduled and then wait for the inspector.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Explain that you may need to wait for a more skilled worker to complete a specific step.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Make it clear that there may be days where no work is happening and that this is a natural part of the process.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s1">POSSIBLE ISSUE</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also often hear that a crew started late in the day, or left the site early. This can be a big pain point, especially if your client thinks the project isn’t moving fast enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLUTION</span> </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can get out ahead of this. Make sure your client knows that you are focused on progress, but that you also have to balance:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The logical sequence of work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Availability of materials<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Individual crewmember health and family issues<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Commitments to other projects<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t mean the project isn’t a priority, it’s simply how you run a business.</span></p>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">Costs for a bathroom renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>.

This is based on expanding an existing 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, relocating all fixtures, and installing a new shower with a frameless glass enclosure, freestanding soaker tub with high-end faucets, stone counters with dual sinks, one-piece toilet, and a humidistat-controlled exhaust fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting started on commercial renovations can be both an exciting and overwhelming time. Perhaps you’re launching a business you’ve been dreaming about for a long time, or, if that dream has already proven successful, you’re expanding (congratulations!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches business owners to the best general contractors and helps the renovation stay on track, offers these guidelines for taking on commercial renovations, whether you are gearing up for an office build-out, a restaurant, retail space or some other venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We based this article on New York City, but it has relevance to wherever you are in the country. The majority of US states base their codes on guidelines from the International Code Council. Cities and towns also have similar procedures when it comes to requirements such as building permits and Certificate of Occupancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few ways to get a head start with your own research. For example, taking a look at your potential building&#8217;s Certificate of Occupancy (CO) or browsing through online building records to get an idea of existing violations. Once you are seriously considering either buying or leasing a property or renovating what you have, that’s the right time to bring in a pro—an engineer, an architect, or a good or knowledgeable general contractor—so there are no surprises down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few things to consider before unleashing the sledgehammer, and in some cases, signing a lease.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40003 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HowSweetenWorks.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="50" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review the certificate of occupancy</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one, two, and three on your checklist before even committing to a lease should be: check the CO, check the CO, and check the CO. The document shows what you can legally use a property for—an office, a private residence, a restaurant, etc. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Here’s a <a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/bsqpm01.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to search in New York City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changing a CO is a costly process and, in some cases, it’s impossible to shift it to another use, according to Mercedes Hernandez from S&amp;M Expediting. Expediters are an optional addition to your building team to speed up the slow grind of permits, especially for commercial renovations in bureaucratic cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We get a lot of calls after the fact when they start the process of getting necessary licenses. That’s when they realize they have a problem,” she said. One client signed a lease with the intention of turning a space into a gym. However, the certificate did not allow for a health club in the premises. That client is still trying to change it and it has already been 12 months. The easiest route is to lease or buy a space where the CO fits your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COs can also dictate smaller issues. For example, if you want to use the property’s backyard for additional restaurant seating, the certificate needs to specify that this is allowable. Otherwise, the CO will need <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/cofo_guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating</a>. Smaller additions such as this are a much easier fix than a change in the legal use of a property, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />Understand existing violations on your property</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Especially if the property you’re eyeing hasn’t changed hands or had a new tenant for some time, it’s possible it already has building violations. It could be that someone did work without a permit, installed a rooftop AC unit incorrectly, or the fire sprinkler system isn’t functioning. “When you go to get a permit, these things are scrutinized and discovered,” explained <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin, a Sweeten general contractor</a>. If the violations aren’t corrected, that could mean a costly stop-work order on your construction project later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickstart this process, like COs, city councils often keep online databases where you can search open violations, when a permitted job was last completed on a building, and what that job was. Complaints about the building—such as work without a permit or a business operating without the correct CO—might also give you a hint at what violations you could encounter. The good news is with a commercial lease it is common to get these violations taken care of by the landlord, but the lease needs to specify this, according to Hernandez.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you might get a sense of a building’s open violations from your own research, it’s unlikely you will spot every one of them on your own. The best plan is to walk through a potential location for your business with an architect, engineer or a GC, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Mark</a>, another Sweeten general contractor. That pro will help you decide if a property is a workable fit for your vision, he said. It’s also something that pros often do as a complimentary service to potential clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Review structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you need to determine if your property can handle the weight of your business. And in some cases, we mean that quite literally. Hernandez’s example illustrates the point: if you want to flip a clothing retail space into a car showroom, it’s a wise idea to make sure the floor can support the added weight. Or how about creating an open-plan office that’s perfect for teamwork? Before drawing up those plans, you need to know what walls are load-bearing and if they can be moved. If moving that wall (or not) is a deal breaker, it’s best to know the capabilities of a space before signing on the dotted line. “You need to ask what are the limits of design,” said Sweeten contractor Colin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessing the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) situation is crucial especially if you’re turning a space into a food establishment with a kitchen. Gas, plumbing and electrical will be under more pressure, so can the property’s existing infrastructure handle it, or is an extensive overhaul required? If it is, prepare your budget and timeline realistically. That’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_restaurant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another reason</a> besides the existing CO that some business owners take the express route of leasing a property that was previously a restaurant. While it&#8217;s not a given everything will be up to code (don’t forget those existing violations), it is easier and cheaper than starting from scratch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39363" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg" alt="Babeland storefront" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Sharon-Lee-Babeland-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/babeland-retail-commercial-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A retail renovation</a> in Downtown New York by Sweeten contractor <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Checking on a building&#8217;s envelope</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An envelope is building speak for whatever separates the outside from the inside—windows, doors, roof, etc. It’s another area worth looking into before starting your project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accessibility for the disabled is often overlooked. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair. While many older buildings may have had their compliance grandfathered in, major commercial renovations could <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-R-0335.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trigger</a> the need for properties to line up with the ADA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that could change the scope of your project include asbestos in window glazing, which would need to be replaced. A property that is a landmark or in a historic district could also <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impact</a> if and how you can alter your building’s facade, including doors and windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What are your facility requirements?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most health codes will require an employer to provide access to toilet facilities. For offices, this could mean a shared bathroom on a floor, according to Hernandez, the expediter. “They have to make sure employees have access to a bathroom from within the building,” she said. One client suggested sending employees to another building, but this was not permitted under the health code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of a food establishment will likely determine how many bathrooms are required for patrons (some sort of bathroom access is always required for employees). In 2012, New York City actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/nyregion/rule-shift-cuts-restroom-requirements-at-new-york-restaurants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowered</a> the required bathrooms, permitting small cafes, restaurants, and bars with fewer than 31 seats to have one bathroom, not two. Those with fewer than 20 seats are <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> required to provide a bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any project, commercial renovations that are well planned and equipped with the right team of people can be exciting. Just be sure to consider these five areas early to keep your renovation on the straight and narrow.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064728861"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>What is a certificate of occupancy?</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A certificate of occupancy (CO) is a document that details what someone can legally use a property for, and the limits to which the property can be changed for that use. For example, a CO could state that a property can be used as an office, a private residence, or a restaurant. Many cities and towns will have online databases where you can download a copy of a property’s CO. Sometimes, it is possible to change a CO to cover a different use, but this can be costly and time-consuming.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640064746876"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to renovate a commercial building</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, review the certificate of occupancy. This will tell you what you are legally allowed to use the building for (an office space, a residence, a gym, etc.) Then, research whether there are any existing violations on the property. Review the space with an architect or contractor, and check for unpermitted work. Also review the structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Will you be able to move walls? Can the current flooring support your business use? Make sure the building’s envelope–the windows, doors, and roof–are in good working condition. Consider people with disabilities. Is there a way for wheelchair users to enter the building? Lastly, understand your facility requirements, like mandatory bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<h3>Why the right general contractor is important</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating can be a complicated process. However, the more you know about working with a general contractor, the better prepared you’ll be. While these professionals execute the labor of your renovation, they are also a collaborator to your dream home. Their team will be working in your space for several months. Because of this, you really want to be confident in knowing how to hire a contractor<span>—the right one for <em>your</em> project</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten outlines the process—from what to look for, to the key responsibilities you can expect from your general contractor.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Do you need a general contractor or a handyman?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step to starting your project is figuring out the scope of your renovation. Depending on the level of labor your project requires, you will either need a general contractor or a handyman (or DIY!). To decipher the difference, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you hanging things on walls, or taking down walls?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Are you re-grouting tiles, or replacing them?</li>
<li>Smaller projects to make repairs or patch-over errors are handyman-ready. On the other hand, large-scale projects that involve electric or plumbing will require a permit or inspection. In this case, a contractor with a state Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license will be obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining labor for your renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For first-time renovators, figuring out what kind of labor is required for the project can be hard to determine. If you live in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-op</a> or condo, your alteration agreement may provide guidelines when hiring a general contractor. In other situations, checking your city’s Department of Buildings will offer information on the types of projects that require a permit. <strong>The most important thing to remember is that cutting corners with unlicensed workers is never worth the risk. </strong>It often leads to homeowners needing to pay extra to fix unfinished, subpar, or non-permitted work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing the research to determine if you need the services of a general contractor is a crucial step in getting your project off the ground. Then the next step is finding the best contractor for your job.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to hire a contractor suited to your project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process of interviewing and hiring a general contractor, start by looking for someone with experience in your neighborhood and who has done similar work. This can help you narrow down the field from thousands of general contractors to just a handful of experienced professionals. Keep these questions in mind as you search:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Has the contractor done work in your neighborhood?</li>
<li>Has the contractor done similar work to what you’re looking to get done?</li>
<li>Can the contractor provide quality references and photos of past work?</li>
<li>Is the contractor licensed? (Working with an unlicensed contractor isn’t worth the risk!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask to see some of their past projects in person or to speak to their past clients—at least two. General contractors in Sweeten&#8217;s network have completed transformational renovations with past clients who are still happy with the work years later. This indicates that the contractor&#8217;s work has held up over time. <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten matches homeowners</a> to a selection of contractors based on location, budget, scope, and style for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you&#8217;ve found someone you think would be a good fit for your project, take it one step further and make sure they’re a good fit for you. You’ll be working with this contractor for the duration of your project, so you should feel compatible! Here&#8217;s what to look for:</p>
<h4>Are they communicative?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you can trust your contractor to be responsive throughout the entire renovation process. Both parties will need to be on the same page, especially in terms of timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is it a good fit personality and style-wise?</h4>
<ul>
<li>First impressions do matter! The contractor should be able to understand and carry out your particular sense of style. Additionally, with the amount of time they’ll be spending in your home, look for someone who meshes with your personality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do they have recent and reliable references?</h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s important<span style="color: #333333;"> to review </span>recent references for similar projects that your contractor has completed. You should be aware of the level of satisfaction of past clients. At Sweeten, our contractors have profiles that highlight past projects and client reviews to help you decide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What does a general contractor do?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your general contractor manages your project from start to finish, focusing on the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain proper licensing, insurance, and additional documents required by city, state, and specific to building needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review site conditions and all relevant documents and drawings in order to fully understand the project and generate a proposal and bid (the proposal is the plan and the bid is the proposed cost)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Specify the final scope of work, and schedule, and come up with a contract</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Define the payment and deliverables schedules</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Request and follow advice from the architects, engineers, or design team</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Manage and coordinate general aspects of a project, like site requirements</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Provide skilled labor, tools, equipment, and various services</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Coordinate subcontractors and other trades required by the scope of work and oversee the quality of their work</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Maintain schedule and communication with clients</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Review project completion with the client and final payment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asking general contractors for estimates (at least 3)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contractor will partner with you to decide on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The final scope of work</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>The best form of communication, and how often they should check in with you</li>
<li>Budget and payment schedule (make sure you have everything in writing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweeten recommends getting 3-5 estimates from contractors to see where the price range falls. This also allows you to experience the different personalities and communication styles of the contractors. Who do you have the best rapport with? Who do you feel the most comfortable with? These factors will play a big part in your decision when hiring a general contractor.</p>
<h3>Understanding estimates from general contractors</h3>
<p>Bid leveling is a crucial step that will allow you to break down and compare the services the contractor can offer at each price point. This occurs once you have received estimates, or bids, from contractors.</p>
<p>For example, one contractor who gives a higher-priced bid may provide more individual services, like answering questions on the weekend or putting a mood board together for you. A comparative breakdown of the bids will reveal a clearer picture of what services you want as a renovator.</p>
<h4>Sweeten offers free bid-leveling services to homeowners</h4>
<p>New to renovating and unsure how to read bids? Sweeten provides a free bid-leveling call to all homeowners who use the service.

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Westchester County </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-westchester-county-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no doubt that Westchester is a picturesque place to live—the luxury of space and peace with the bustle of New York City a quick trip away. Some recent buyers and established homeowners alike feel it would be even more idyllic if they had their dream kitchen, whether it&#8217;s renovating a new home or fulfilling a long-desired wish to upgrade. The first step is often the stumbling block: determining the budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/kitchen-renovation-costs-money-goes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national average</a> for a basic 200-square-foot kitchen renovation is $63,829.  Westchester County has a slightly higher average <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2017/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen renovation cost</a> landing at <strong>$65,651</strong> or <strong>$328 a square foot</strong>, according to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA). Let’s break that budget down into bite-sized pieces to help you get closer to your dream cooking and entertaining space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DESIGN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an important line item in your budget, especially if your vision involves a layout change. That could involve moving load-bearing walls and gas lines. The NKBA estimates design fees eat up about four percent of a kitchen remodel cost. Sweeten designer <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maryana</a>, who has done work in Westchester, said it&#8217;s more realistic to put away 15 percent of your budget for design if you’re in the mood for a major layout change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re giving your kitchen more of a makeover than an overhaul, it’s possible to work closely with an experienced general contractor on the design and forgo a designer. Statistics from the NKBA show that the majority of homeowners relied on a general contractor and only 22 percent used a designer. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck</a>, a Sweeten contractor who works in Westchester, has found that many clients in the county take a hands-on approach to design and often don’t use a designer or architect. However, an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect&#8217;s services will be needed</a> if plumbing or gas lines are moving, there are structural changes, or if a landmark property is being renovated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PERMITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building permits are handled by the building department of each individual town within Westchester County. &#8220;Individual&#8221; is the key word here because methods of calculations can change dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Rye, the most of the <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/money/real-estate/homes/2017/03/22/westchester-priciest-zipcodes/99506058/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a> area in Southern Westchester—the median price for a home is $1,380,000—it’s no surprise that building permits are calculated based on the cost of a renovation. For every $1,000 in your kitchen remodel budget, that’s an additional $17 for your building permits. That average $64,000 kitchen overhaul will cost at least $1,088 in permits. If plumbing and electrical permits are required, that’s an additional $200 a pop (for a less extensive renovation, these permits may not be necessary).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the township of Peekskill, building permit costs are at the end of a minor mathematical equation. Multiply the square footage of your project by $150. Then, multiply that figure by 0.10. For a 200-square-foot kitchen, that’s $3,000. So take a moment to look at how the building department of your township calculates permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/westchester-county-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-34831 size-full" title="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png" alt="Find Westchester County Kitchen Contractors" width="320" height="60" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button.png 320w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Westchester-Button-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLIANCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Village Appliances in Westchester, a budget appliance package (fridge, oven, dishwasher and microwave), can go for under $5,000. However, Joe Gagliardo, the owner of Village Appliances, doesn’t sell too many of those. The majority of customers either go for a package in the $5,000 to $8,000 range or in the mid-price range of $18,000 to $22,000, which will get you brands such as General Electric and Electrolux. The high-end price spectrum will deliver brands such as Viking and Miele for a four-piece suite (fridge, range, hood, and dishwasher) at a price ranging from $17,000 to $26,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At <a href="https://bilotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bilotta Kitchens</a>, clients often buy in the $12,000 to $15,000 range for an appliance package, according to senior designer and CKD Randy O’Kane. This will get you brands such as Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Wolf. There’s always room to mix and match, but brands do offer a discount or throw in items like blenders, toasters and hoods for free if you go with the same brand for your appliances, Randy said. “It is the heart and soul of a kitchen,” she said. “Cabinets are great, but it is all about cooking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation can cost between $500 and $1,000, and that price will depend on how much work your contractor has already done. If water lines have not been run or outlets are not in the necessary areas, that could push up installation costs, Joe said. For those after custom range hoods, then plan for the $2,000 and $8,000 range.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CABINETS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabinets and hardware (think handles and knobs) are a big-ticket item on every kitchen remodel cost budget. They typically take up 30 percent of costs, according to NKBA. In a basic kitchen renovation, that’s $6,000. For a major overhaul worth $60,000, cabinets cost almost $20,000. What typically makes a big <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difference in cabinet cost</a> is whether you want custom, pre-fabricated or a mix of both. Something pre-fabricated from IKEA or Home Depot will cost around $130 a linear foot. Custom jobs can shoot up to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,000 a linear square foot</a>. However, with that higher price, there is more freedom in deciding your kitchen layout. You can also get <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a better warranty</a> with custom cabinets. Semi-custom cabinets generally are about 50 percent cheaper than full custom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or do what Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill did in her own kitchen renovation: the recycled customized option. &#8220;I scoured Renovation Angel&#8217;s website and purchased a used-but-high-end kitchen for about $10,000, which is what I could have spent on cabinets alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A complete kitchen included appliances and cabinetry.&#8221; Jean then customized the cabinets to fit her space, which often meant filler panels were wider on one side than the other, or building a soffit was necessary. &#8220;It was like working on a jigsaw puzzle in order to make the kitchen look like it fit in the space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I was okay with these kinds of imperfections in exchange for essentially getting a premium kitchen on an Ikea type of budget.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COUNTERTOPS</strong></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.westchesterkitchenandbath.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester Kitchen and Bath</a>, quartz is overwhelmingly the most popular countertop, according to showroom manager and designer Donna Magnotta. “It’s heat-, stain-, scratch-, and bacteria-resistant,” she said, “and it&#8217;s maintenance-free.” Natural stones, like marble, need routine staining and sealing. Quartz starts around $85 per linear foot and is on the mid to high-end of the price scale, which includes the cost of fabricating and installing. Laminate starts at $20 a linear foot, but is rarely purchased, Donna said. Granite is next up the ladder at about $35 a linear foot. On the high end, natural stones start at about $120 a linear foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kitchen lighting isn’t a big budget line item. It takes up on four percent of total costs on average. The end price, of course, will always be determined by your tastes. In a $20,000 kitchen, that’s only $800. For a major remodel in the $60,000 range, lighting costs look closer to $2,400.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PLUMBING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an average remodel, plumbing costs are about the same at $800. If there is a layout change to your Westchester kitchen, then that will likely add to your plumbing costs, which also includes gas lines. And the more you alter the basic layout of your space, the more your kitchen remodel cost will increase for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materials</a>, labor, permitting, and inspections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FLOORING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a budget, Westchester’s <a href="https://suburbanfloors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suburban Floors</a> has a vinyl Karndean-Knight Tile that is $3.50 a square foot that is “still very durable and stylish,” said Emily Carpentieri, the store’s owner. The price per square foot does not include installation. On the higher end is cork or wide-plank wood flooring. These go for $8.25 to $15 a square foot. But vinyl floors in the $5 to $7 range is Suburban Floors’ biggest seller. “These would blow your mind how real they looked,” said Emily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LABOR AND INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction labor can change depending upon your Westchester zip code. The costs are less expensive the further you are from NYC. For Peekskill, labor costs are 22 percent higher than the national average, according to <a href="https://www.fixr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fixr.com</a>. Dobbs Ferry comes in at 40 percent higher and Croton-on-Hudson at 27 percent higher than the national average. The kitchen renovation cost in Rye could have a labor budget 55 percent above the national average. To compare, the labor cost for a kitchen renovation on the Upper East Side is 77 percent higher than the national average.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t forget installation for appliances, cabinetry, plumbing, and electrical. These typically take about 17 percent of a budget, which is about $3,500 for an average kitchen. And as mentioned above, factor in $500 to $1,000 for appliance installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the day, renovations are like fingerprints<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no two are alike. That includes their budgets. Here’s how one Sweeten renovator in Westchester allocated their $56,620 renovation budget:</p>

			<h2>Make it easier for a co-op board to approve your home renovation with a few key steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22518 size-chrono" title="co-op boards" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01_300-Riverside_3-723x481.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="481" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op buildings have unique ownership structures. C-op owners technically lease the space an apartment occupies. A co-op board, and its representative, the management company, have power over any renovations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’d like to do. Because the board’s role is to protect the interests of all of the owners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the process is less in your control than you&#8217;d think. However, by following a few key practices, you can put your co-op board at ease for your desired remodel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Simple renovations may not need co-op board approval</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most basic work done in kitchens and bathrooms is known as “rip and replace.” This work includes updating finishes, replacing porcelain plumbing fixtures, and upgrading appliances in their existing locations. For this, your building may not demand a permit; saving you money, time, and general red tape.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How your building will evaluate your plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your building is likely to use its own architect to evaluate any renovation plans you submit. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his process is known as an alteration review.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Expect to pay for this service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, typically in the $1,000-$2,000 range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The architect may flag aspects of the design which seem only tangentially related to your renovation objectives </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e.g., relocating the intercom). As a result,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communications can drag on for months. However, the principal concerns of this review will not be aesthetic. Rather, the building architect is charged with protecting the building from liability, plus advising the board about building code requirements. Overall dimensions of rooms, and door openings, may need to be enlarged as part of gut renovations. In other cases, wet areas, like bathrooms and kitchens, may be required to stay within the pre-renovation footprint. This requirement is also known as “wet over wet.” These rules act to protect a downstairs neighbor from flooding after a bathroom upstairs is enlarged over, say, a bed. Also remember that with new plumbing, the building may also require you to replace branch lines all the way back to the main water lines. This may result in additional demolition and expenses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bring in your own architect</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For larger jobs, you’ll need your own architect or engineer. Some offer advice on style and design at a premium price. Others will produce a basic set of drawings that can be submitted to the co-op board or management. They may also file renovation plans with the city, in a service known as “architect of record” and “expediter.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Larger renovations requiring a city permit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permit for a larger co-op renovation can sometimes be a judgment call. In extreme cases, your board may decide to make you file for one after work has begun. (Be aware: this can possibly result in fines and other city penalties!) The city will also require you to produce a certificate documenting asbestos tests for areas of the apartment that will be demolished. Asbestos can be found in many places: in plaster or joint compound, in caulking, in linoleum flooring, or even impregnated in the underlayment for wood floors. Should asbestos be present, you will be asked to plan for removal by specialists, or encapsulation. The latter is usually cheaper, leaving asbestos undisturbed and adding new finishes on top, when space and aesthetic considerations allow this.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Legal considerations &amp; co-op rules</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op board or building likely has already published and distributed alteration terms or as “house rules,” which should be reviewed closely. They often cover things like requirements for working hours, deliveries, and protections mandated for common areas during debris removal. Even in jobs that do not require permits, you will want to provide management with a written scope of work, listing the various upgrades you propose and requesting written permission—at least over email—to proceed.</span></p>
<h3>What is an alternation agreement?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit your plans,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-op board may ask you to sign an “alteration agreement.” This alteration agreement can include provisions tailored to your particular job. It is not uncommon, especially in blue-chip buildings, for these agreements to encompass punitive regulations. Provisions like time limits for renovations, and daily penalties imposed when jobs are not completed as requested by the co-op board, are not uncommon. These agreements may also<span>—not surprisingly—</span>seek to shift liability for construction to the apartment owner. In cases of particularly punitive agreements, however, you may choose to engage a tenant’s lawyer to negotiate more favorable terms with the building’s legal representative. Typically, you will need to acknowledge the agreement in exchange for the co-op board’s or management company’s signature on your building permit application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding problems in a co-op renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proprietary lease may allow inspections, so the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building architect or superintendent may ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a look around your apartment, should any questions arise about your proposed renovations or even work underway. For this reason, it is worth keeping the apartment clean and tidy, whether you are living there through the renovation, or not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An environmental testing firm may visit the apartment to monitor lead levels as part of a regular inspection. (This is most likely if your building has a history of lead.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don&#8217;t panic—especially if you have an advance warning. State environmental agencies recommend cleaning with a HEPA vacuum for soft surfaces, or soapy water and paper towels for hard surfaces.</span></p>
<h3>Managing relationships with your co-op board</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in the good graces of your co-op board, and particularly becoming friendly with the board president, can short-circuit potential miscommunications and suspicions based on building gossip. The co-op board has the ultimate discretion to direct the building management in matters regarding the schedule and procedures around your renovation. And if you are hoping any exceptions will be made, neighborliness—to say nothing of cookies or Champagne—may help. Good luck navigating the co-op board to fulfill your renovation dreams!</span></p>
