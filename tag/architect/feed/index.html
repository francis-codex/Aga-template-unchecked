A full-service design/build general contracting firm can also offer comprehensive architectural services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">After your plans are complete, you will use them to find a general contractor that meets your needs. If your project requires an architect, your <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractor may also be able to refer one. </span><span class="s1">The most successful projects will use an architect and contractor that have worked together before and complement each other’s work.</span></p><p class="p5">Here, <span class="s2">we</span> lay out the full details on when your project will need an architect and how much you should expect to pay. <span class="s1">Our vetted contractors can help homeowners access different levels of architectural services and architects. </span></p><h3 class="p5">You’ll need an architect when the DOB requires signed plans</h3><p class="p5">First, your city/building may require you to use one. Are you are making any significant changes that require the involvement of your Department of Buildings? If so, then you&#8217;ll need an architect to make applications and pull permits. As architect Shannon Reid of <a href="https://rwa.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Reid Wilson Architects</span></a> told us, “<span class="s4">Each jurisdiction has a clear delineation on what types of projects require a licensed professional to sign and seal the drawings. NYC is more restrictive than most, and homeowners may find an architect is required due to DOB regulations.” </span></p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if the remodel affects walls, electrical, and plumbing</h3><p class="p8"><span class="s5">“</span>An architect is generally required when a remodel requires the removing or relocation of walls,” as architect John Kim of <a href="http://kmystudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">Kimoy Studios</span></a> told us.</p><p class="p8">If walls are being moved, your remodel will likely “affect plumbing counts or locations,” and require city, as well as co-op/condo board approvals, as architect Steven Harper of <a href="https://www.mndpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">MNDPC</span></a> explained.</p><h3 class="p8">You’ll need an architect if you want a professional to manage the project</h3><p class="p8">According to Shannon, “Architects often act as owner’s representatives during the construction phase.” Also, “&#8230;during construction, the architect follows the project to make sure the contractor is following the drawings and the end result is what the homeowner has approved.&#8221;</p><p class="p8">All that said, “architects are essentially professional problem solvers, so any remodel or modification could benefit from the advice or services an architect can offer,” said architect Steven.</p><h3 class="p10">What services do architects offer?</h3><p class="p5">Given the scale of these types of projects, the money spent on architectural services is worth it! One key benefit: architects will project-manage the remodel from start to finish. This is ideal for busy homeowners or those new to remodeling. Additionally, architects use their training to create an optimal and thoughtful design to suit your lifestyle. This guarantees that your new space suits your needs perfectly.</p><p class="p10">When you hire an architect, you can opt for a full suite of services. This includes the following:</p><p><img decoding="async" title="hire-architect-project-graph" class="alignnone wp-image-31023 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg" alt="when to hire an architect project graph" width="1032" height="552" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a.jpg 1032w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-300x160.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1000-Project-Graph-5a-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p><h3 class="p10">How much does an architect cost?</h3><p class="p5">That sounds great, you say! But how much will it cost? For residential remodels, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. In major urban areas like New York City, this is typically between 15-20 percent for a project costing under $100,000. Large or costly projects budgeted above $250,000 or more can sometimes be billed at a lower percentage, between 10-15 percent.</p><p class="p5">When it comes to permit fees or application fees, they are either required fixed fees or are based on the cost of construction. <span class="s6">These vary based on location but in general, once a project is under construction, additional fees might be paid to the Department of Buildings.</span> Expect fees if you change the plans and the application needs to be amended, or if the construction time is extended.</p><p class="p11"><span class="s8">The cost of an expediter is often minimal when working with the Department of Buildings in towns outside city limits (you don’t usually need one). </span>It’s not uncommon to be able to walk into the buildings department of smaller towns and obtain the information you’re looking for without an expediter.</p><p class="p5">Some architects may charge a fixed rate, an hourly rate, or a cost per square foot. However, these fee structures are less common for full-service residential remodel projects.</p><h3 class="p10">Can I hire an architect for standalone services?</h3><p class="p5">If you do not plan to do a gut remodel, it doesn’t make sense to pay for the full package. However, there are certain situations where you may need an architect for just one part of your project. For example, if <span class="s9">your building requires schematic designs</span> by a registered architect (RA), for a fairly small bathroom project.</p><p class="p5">For those who are willing to provide one-off services, you will typically work out an hourly billing arrangement. Alternately, they may <span class="s10">charge a flat rate based on the time needed to complete it. </span>Some architects do not charge for initial consultations. If they do, they&#8217;ll apply that cost towards the project total if you award the project to them.</p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Depending on their experience and seniority, a project manager&#8217;s hourly rate will range between $100 to $150. For a principal RA, expect $175 to $250. You can also request a cap on the hourly rate if you need to stay within budget. </span></p><p class="p8"><span class="s5">Architect Steven told us that </span>they typically offer “pre-design services for a modest fee (fixed cost, not hourly) that would include—among other things—a site visit, code review, preliminary budget and schedule estimates, and feasibility. This fee is credited against the fee for our full services if we proceed with a project. However, the deliverables can just as easily be used to engage with another firm if that is a better fit.”</p><p>Do you need an architect for your project? We match homeowners—for free—with design-build firms that offer architectural services. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best vetted contractors</span></a>.</span></p><p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46403 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png" alt="Image of a clickable button to Post A Renovation Project" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CTA-PostRenovation-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p><h3>More popular questions</h3>					</div>

Materials and techniques used in the project need to be appropriate for the application and won’t fail under normal use. An architect will be needed if a remodeling project involves moving walls or roofs. Their expertise ensures that any changes to an existing structure remain structurally sound. </span></p></div>

Small adjustments like changing the floor covering or paint color will not involve the architect, so the builder can proceed without approval. Changing structural elements however, like adding an exterior door or moving a wall will require the input and approval of the architect.  </span></p></div>

<li class="li2"><span class="s3"><strong>Architect:</strong> Can Vu Bui and Lane Rick, principal architects at the Office of Things, and in collaboration with architect Matthew Storrie, found a general contractor by <span class="s4">posting the </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/43173#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s4">1920s rowhouse project</span></a><span class="s4"> </span>on Sweeten<br />

</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s3"><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> A front-to-back reenvision of the home’s 600-square-foot ground floor, bringing in space and light and solving storage problems throughout<br />

<li><strong>Architect&#8217;s quote:</strong> <span class="s1">“As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and expertise to the project.”</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Opening up a claustrophobic layout</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Be patient and be bold,” Can Vu Bui, a Brooklyn principal at <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, a collaborative architecture and design studio, likes to tell his clients. This was his mantra going into the main floor gut renovation of an Art Deco–era rowhouse in Glendale, Queens. Bui’s slow, steady approach led to a striking result.</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The homeowners had been living in the home when they hired Bui, and were ready for dramatic change on the brick building’s first floor. They planned on revising the existing layout to bring air and light to a chronically dreary space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After coming up with a concept reflecting light modernism,</span><span class="s1"> Bui created a project plan and posted the job on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our website</a>. They worked with the homeowner to review bids and portfolios before hiring a contracting firm in Queens.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Starting out, the team had their work cut out for them. “The house’s primary problem was a direct product of its 1920s design,” the architect said. The brick-and-mortar building, surrounded by townhomes, had a narrow, chopped-up floor plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenges of opening the 600-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main floor space</a>, according to Bui, were abundant. A load-bearing masonry wall blocked light from reaching the living and dining rooms. Walls that separated the stair, kitchen, and dining area inhibited flow, creating “small, claustrophobic” spaces, he said.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art Deco-approved arches</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The light and space problems at the top of Bui’s task list were only the beginning. “This project presented an opportunity to fix those pragmatic issues,” he said, but also to pull together and “artfully unify” the divided ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Door frames and wall openings were inconsistent, but the building held some inspiring original details. Fortunately, a few with gently rounded upper corners caught the architect’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bui envisioned sloping designs to link the spaces together. “We replaced existing walls with elegant structural arches,” the architect said. “The rooms open generously into each other, allowing light to pour into the home’s interior.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Stairs open up with storage</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the desire for openness and light, maximum storage space was still needed for functionality and day-to-day life, particularly in New York City homes, according to Bui. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to his plan, the general contractor opened the wall between the existing stair and dining room, removing a large, square center section. Next, the contracting team revised the staircase, adding a landing a few steps from the base and then introducing a turn, so that the last few steps led into the dining room. The changes helped the narrow stairs and small dining room feel instantly less claustrophobic.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the breaking through of the wall eliminated key storage space. Bui found a fix. “We designed <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom millwork</a>” surrounding the new wall opening, he says, “that provided a pantry, cabinets, and a low bench,” as well as custom handrails. In the end, a partially exposed stairway brings light and drama to the home.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paint colors and bright finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walls and the interior planes of the arches are painted in muted shades—green, ochre, and blue. Curved millwork is also seen on a full wall of open storage in the dining room. The brushed oak is stained with a hint of gold. Brass accents bring warmth to the rooms.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Many homeowners and designers fear color,” he said. “It makes sense—you don’t want to be stuck with the wrong one.” The architectural team worked closely with the homeowner throughout the process, providing renderings, tests, and mockups to prevent surprises. For instance, the shade of gold on the walls in the foyer and dining room carefully bookends the space without overwhelming or darkening the area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The pale <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green in the kitchen</a> and reading nook plays homage to classical French country homes,” Bui said. The effect is an inviting color path leading one through the house. “Our goal,” Bui said, “is to let color boldly elevate the feeling of a space.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architect + Sweeten general contractor = Teamwork heaven</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the process, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architect and Sweeten general contractor</a> worked together closely, executing Bui’s vision. “As architects, we spend a lot of time designing custom details—our relationships with the contractors who can make them are critical. It’s great to work with craftspeople who bring insight and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/queens-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expertise to the project</a>.”</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Bui explained, the renovation made over the once spiritless space—it feels bright and modern, but not harsh or humorless. Furthermore, color and flow now have a direct impact on the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comfort one feels in their surroundings</a>. “This is a home, after all,” Bui said. “It should feel special.”</span></p>

But, what type of remodeling companies will you need to hire for your project? Do you only need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/">hire a general contractor</a>, or would you benefit from reaching out to an architect, interior designer, or even a design-build contractor? The answer will vary d<span class="s1">epending on your project scope, your preferences, and your budget. </span></p><p><span class="s1">Knowing exactly who to reach out to, and when, will save you time in the hiring process — that means you can start enjoying your remodeled home sooner.</span></p><p>Every major renovation project requires a general contractor to oversee the daily construction work. Some renovations, however, also require a licensed architect for technical and design services. This can include creating the necessary drawings for your building board or Department of Buildings (or local equivalent) permits and approvals. Even when not required, some homeowners also opt to hire architects to provide <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/">a level of style</a>, detail, and management. The added expense is sometimes estimated at 20% of the total project budget.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s important to note that there can be overlap among design services. </span><span class="s1">For example, most home remodeling architects and interior designers can provide expertise for layout and finish materials, though these specifics can vary a lot from firm to firm. If you hire an interior designer who creates updated floor plans, they may secure the services of an architect to have them professionally &#8220;stamped&#8221; when required. </span></p><p>Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">outlines what each renovation professional brings to the project.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48228" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1100" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-273x300.jpg 273w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Who-Do-I-Hire-Graph-600x660.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><h3>When you should hire an architect</h3><p>You’ll <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-work-with-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need an architect</a> if any of the following apply to your renovation:</p><ul><li>Changing the layout, making additions, or tearing down walls</li><li>Moving plumbing lines such as bathtub or dishwasher</li><li>Moving gas lines</li><li>Doing work on a landmark property</li><li>Any changes that require approval from the Department of Buildings</li></ul><h3>When you should hire a general contractor</h3><p>Hiring a general contractor may best suit your job if none of the above apply to your renovation. You would also have a general idea of what you’d like to do with the space. <span class="s1">Post your project at Sweeten where most contractors can give some guidance on design, materials, and creative solutions for tackling challenges. Alternatively, you can also request a design-build firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p>NOTE: A remodeling contractor who is licensed ensures that the necessary level of checkpoints and screening processes have been met. More on this below.</p><h3>Benefits of hiring a design-build firm</h3><p>Design-build contractors can be a cost-effective option for medium to large-scale renovations. They also work well on any project that requires high <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/hudson-yards-renovation-updates-foyer-kitchen-bath/">attention to detail</a>. Design-build contractor teams offer:</p><ul><li>A full package of design, construction, and project management services</li><li>A single point of contact from start to finish</li><li>A fluid process with more predictable timelines between design and construction phases</li></ul><h3>When you should hire an interior designer</h3><p>If walls and room functions are not being altered dramatically, <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interior designer</a> can help with things like:</p><ul><li>Considering overall traffic flow, lighting, and space planning</li><li>Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/">custom built-ins and cabinetry</a></li><li>Project management and purchasing of materials, fixtures, and appliances</li><li>Choosing furniture styles, color palette, and finishes</li></ul><h3>Why you should always hire a licensed general contractor</h3><p>A locally valid license and proper insurance are a must-have for any reliable general contractor. Your county or state website will list all licensed contractors in the licensing or consumer affairs sections. With <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/">Sweeten&#8217;s contractor vetting</a>, for example, a New York City-based contractor must have a valid Home Improvement Contractor (HIC) license. </p><h4>Getting cheaper bids from unlicensed remodeling contractors</h4><p>A note of warning to those tempted by the lower estimates of an unlicensed contractor: remodeling contractors without bonafide credentials may not be able to obtain the required permits for your job. Permits do cost money and take time to procure for any home renovation. However, if the contractor&#8217;s work fails to meet building codes, you will be responsible for the reconstruction. This can turn into an unpleasant surprise when homeowners who want to sell their home find out they must fix work that doesn&#8217;t meet permitting standards.</p><h4>Am I liable if I hire an unlicensed contractor?</h4><p>Allowing work on your property by an unlicensed remodeling contractor could also nullify your homeowner’s insurance policy. If the contractor doesn&#8217;t have workers’ compensation insurance, you become the de facto employer. You&#8217;ll be responsible for any accidents on the property (or anyone else’s property) if the contractor is negligent.</p><h3>Hire the best contractor for a home renovation</h3><p>Homeowners are rightfully concerned about how to tackle a renovation in an organized fashion. It&#8217;s best to build your team of renovation professionals based on the needs of your home renovation project, whether that involves architectural plans and permits, deciding the aesthetic or finishes, or all—or none—of the above.

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction + architecture?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I was born in Easton, Maryland. I grew up there and moved to Newark, Delaware when I was 10.  I’ve been in the field of architecture and design since 2004.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Originally from Wilmington, Delaware. I have been involved in the construction industry in some form since 1986.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into the industry?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: I started my career as an interior designer, but always worked for architects in a role that more closely resembled an interior architect rather than a designer or decorator. During the recession, I was lucky enough to retain my job but shifted studios within the large firm I was working for and made the decision to pursue my architectural license. Dave put up with me during a year of maniacal studying while working full time and taking those exams to get the license.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>:  I started life in finance. I worked for a large financial company for over 12 years. At the same time, I had a side life in construction. I soon learned that I enjoyed seeing things get built rather than just moving numbers around. I made a bold decision to change my life to do something that challenges me every day in a way that I can enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love most about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: Transforming old run-down spaces into beautiful places that people can enjoy with their families. We really enjoy going into different buildings throughout the city that we&#8217;ve never been in to get a different taste of the city.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Designing spaces that maximize the layout and function for our clients while still meeting the (sometimes seemingly ridiculous) NYC Building Code restrictions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Constraints: limited timeframes, limited building hours, unhappy neighbors, logistics for material deliveries, logistics moving crew to projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32502 size-chrono" title="Renovation Checklist" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg" alt="Renovation Checklist" width="723" height="143" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-723x143.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist-600x119.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GCs_Embeds-RenoChecklist.jpg 975w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If clients have questions or concerns, how would you like them to address them?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: We highly value communication and feel it is the most important part of the process. We want clients to bring their questions or concerns to us as soon as possible so that we can address them as quickly as possible. We use web-based software to manage projects and clients can post their questions/comments with pictures and our team can address them, but email and phone calls also work. However, please don’t text us at 3:00am—we have lives and families too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: We’re going to encounter hiccups. That’s nearly a given. You’re hiring our team to navigate those hiccups in the least painful way possible so that you can continue to enjoy your life while we deal with the challenges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: As with many things in life, you often get what you pay for. We are not the least expensive option in the city, but if you want good quality work from a full-service team that will commit to your project and give you a great experience, we’re worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City building? </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: Oddly and not for architectural reasons, the Time Warner Center at Columbus.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: Grand Central Station.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan</span>: The West Village.<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">David</span>: The Financial District.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Megan and David</span>: El Centro–before having a family, we used to go twice a week. Amazing margaritas and no-frills Mexican!</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27189 size-chrono" title="retail store" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Karjaka-USP-Rebecca-Taylor-1.jpg-14.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Designer Rebecca Taylor store&nbsp;project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor David</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical brick-and-mortar store is a bold and energizing step. It’s a chance to create a walk-in version of&nbsp;a business you’ve been&nbsp;growing, or&nbsp;a tangible&nbsp;realization of a long-awaited vision to be your own boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail renovation costs<span>—</span>for, say, a clothing or beauty boutique, yoga studio or art gallery can slide from pricey to economical&#8230;depending on what you want. Chain Store Age’s annual survey of retail build-outs put the average cost at $56.53 per square foot. If you use that formula, then it will cost $280,000 for a 5,000-square-foot store build-out. In another example, an entrepreneur in Austin, Texas, only spent $7,650 on a build-out for Little Green Beans, a children’s consignment store for clothing and toys, according to <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/business-start-up-costs-retail-store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inc.</a>&nbsp;(The business owner&#8217;s breakdown of costs were: $4,000 construction to customize the space, $3,500 for shelves, racks, etc., and a mere $150 for a handyman).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t be too overwhelmed by this figure. As the name suggests, the&nbsp;above survey takes into account bigger stores that are more commonly found in malls than a Main Street space in an older building. A simple build-out for a smaller store<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>minor construction, a coat of paint, shelves, and racks<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>can cost under $10,000. It all depends on the scope of work and what finishes you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To figure out this wide world of retail build-out budgets for your project, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, offers a few areas to consider.<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Design for a commercial storefront space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you choose to hire a designer or architect (not everyone does), expect that to take 20 percent of your renovation budget, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect Carla</a>. That could mean $40,000 in a $200,000 budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Retail projects can be as small as custom shelving for storing product, using existing electrical wiring, and&nbsp;applying&nbsp;a fresh coat of paint. With a build-out that basic, you might avoid the need for permits, thus eliminating the need for blueprints to be approved by an architect. However, if you’re serious about optimizing the size of your space and carefully planning the customer experience, then it&#8217;s best to bring in the big guns. “What do you want the customers to experience? What do you want them to see when they first walk in?” said Carla. Then there are the more technical design elements like handicap accessibility and whether or not you need a bathroom. These are best handled by an architect.</p>
<h3><strong>Electrical costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chain Store Age survey put the cost of interior lighting at $3.30 a square foot. As mentioned above, electrical can be kept simple by using existing wiring and even fixtures to keep these costs down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott, another Sweeten contractor</a>, has worked on retail build-outs where electrical has been as low as $10,000 or as high as $100,000. Splurges in lighting often come from a client wanting specific light fixtures that are in line with their brand. Altering the position of each light to highlight store product or fixing up existing, decrepit wiring could increase your budget for electrical. Once you get into more serious work, your project might also require the additional cost of applying for permits that could also delay your timeline, Scott said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it isn’t just lighting that needs to be considered. If your business has additional power needs, such as a salon or a dog groomer with equipment like hair dryers, it is best to assess what power burden your ideal store location can handle before signing a lease. That way, you can either find another location or factor in an electrical upgrade into your budget if necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cjJnJjIEXOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plumbing costs for a commercial space</strong></h3>
<p>This area of the budget will largely depend on:</p>
<p>A. Is there is a bathroom?</p>
<p>B. If no, then would you like a bathroom?</p>
<p>C. If you have one, will it stay in the same place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a bathroom, then it is possible to freshen it up with a coat of paint. If there is no bathroom, you should consider if it will help your business and your staff (otherwise they might have to close the store whenever they need to use a restroom). “You want to keep customers in your store rather than give them a reason to leave,” said Scott, on why a bathroom might help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very basic bathroom could set you back $3,000 to $6,000, according to <a href="https://home.costhelper.com/bathroom-addition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost Helper</a>. It could attract additional costs if the location is far from water and sewage lines and if you need the help from a structural engineer. A plumbing permit will also be needed. Moving a bathroom will gather similar costs with the added line item of demolition. If your business has unique needs like a washing station for a hair salon, that will be another cost to factor in.</p>
<h3><strong>Flooring and ceiling costs&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a retail build-out, flooring on average takes up $2.76 per square foot in a budget and ceilings take $1.81, according to Chain Store Age. If there are no structural issues with the flooring (again, check your lease to ensure the landlord is responsible for these costs), then what you do to the floors will likely just be cosmetic. If that is the case—you&#8217;re re-varnishing existing floors or laying some tiles—then the project likely won’t require a permit, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin,&nbsp;a Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>HVAC costs in commercial spaces</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of either fixing, replacing or installing an HVAC system costs on average about $2.61 per square foot or about $13,000 for a 5,000-square-foot space. Like everything else, this average can swing in either direction based on what you have, what you want, and what you can afford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way to avoid this cost entirely is to negotiate a lease that puts the responsibility of the HVAC system onto the landlord, according to Colin. As an alternative, you can volunteer to take care of the HVAC system and request that the landlord give you three months of free rent. If it is a simple step of replacing the air conditioning unit with something modern, it likely won’t require a permit, said Scott.</p>
<h3><strong>Millwork costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, retail build-outs spend almost $10 a square foot on display fixtures or millwork, according to the Chain Store Age survey. That’s roughly 20 percent of an average budget. But of course, it all depends on your vision for your store.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three factors that determine how expensive your displays will be are material, quantity, and what space they need to fit into, Scott said. The cost of simple wood from Home Depot will pale in comparison to teak from Brazil. Spaces, especially older ones, can also have quirks in them that need to be incorporated into the design of your shelving. “There can be a lot of bends and cuts that you have to fit the wood to,” said Scott. “That can consume a lot of time and add more to the cost.”</p>
<h3><strong>Paint costs</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting to the paint stage means you are close to the finish line. Your walls need to be prepared first, which might be your priciest point, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Another element that will affect your paint budget is if the color is flat, which is generally a better value than a semi-gloss. Also, the darker the color, the more coats of paint you will need, Bill said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-world retail example</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put things in perspective, here is an actual retail renovation budget for a New York beauty salon from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Paul</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26944 mb-0 size-chrono" title="actual NYC beauty salon renovation estimate / 1,130 sq ft" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Commercial_reno_budget_retail-723x533.jpg" alt="retail renovation cost" width="723" height="533"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opening a physical store is an exciting moment for a business. Whether it&#8217;s a simple build-out or one with more moving parts, there&#8217;s a path for you to bring your storefront into the spotlight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>

This number covers multiple cost categories, such as design, lighting, flooring, plumbing, paint, and HVAC. Design costs will be about 20% of total costs. Interior lighting will cost about $3.30 per square foot of space. Plumbing, like adding a basic bathroom, can cost $3-6K or more. Flooring will cost about $2.76 per square foot, and the ceiling will cost about $1.81 per square foot. HVAC systems will cost roughly $2.61 per square foot. </p> </div> </div>

<h3>Storage space with a Japanese vibe</h3>
<p>Joseph, an immigration lawyer and painter, and Sunghee, a curator and former director of Art Space Pool, a non-profit art space in South Korea, rented their mid-century Clinton Hill co-op in Brooklyn for several years before purchasing it from the owner. They were lucky the 606-square-foot apartment had been modernized before they moved in with new white oak floors, kitchen upgrades, and bath updates with Ikea products. When it became their own, they wanted the home to reflect their modern Japanese aesthetic and to have additional storage space.</p>
<div></div>
<p>They turned to architect Brett Masterson of <a href="https://masterson.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterson Architecture &amp; Design Co.</a>, who had renovated his own one-bedroom in their building. They were impressed by how he had maximized his even smaller space and created custom storage solutions that disappeared when not in use.</p>

<h3>Integrating lifestyle and function</h3>
<p>The couple’s main objective for the 44-square-foot area was to open up the closed-off kitchen to the rest of the apartment and, ideally, double their storage space. The marriage of the Japanese aesthetic—minimal hardware, natural and warm materials—with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-storage-solutions-small-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clever organizational solutions</a> drove their vision. &#8220;The project was like a renovation version of author Marie Kondo’s <a href="https://konmari.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KonMari Method</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for tidying up,&#8221; the architect said.</p>
<p>Brett spent a lot of time understanding how the couple used the space: their lifestyle patterns, what they had for breakfast, and how they spent their evenings. He wanted the renovation to adapt to Sunghee and Joseph&#8217;s routines, while also streamlining their day-to-day through purposeful design and space planning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37016 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Built-ins and organizational systems</h3>
<p>They faced challenges right away: First, it took a long time for the co-op board to approve the project. Then, the co-op board wouldn&#8217;t allow the wall where the electrical panel and intercom were located to be removed. That limited how open they could make the kitchen on one side. They still were able to open the wall that faced the large living room windows, which meant they could have a direct sightline to the outdoors and add to the open feel. They also flipped the electrical panel to the inside of the kitchen so it wasn’t as visible. A base cabinet at the wall’s cut-out that Brett calls “the landing strip” is a place to kick off shoes, store keys, wallets, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37011 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The small kitchen didn&#8217;t have enough working space for two people to comfortably prepare a meal together. The compact fridge took up a quarter of the kitchen, so they relocated it to a new adjacent storage wall across the entry hallway. That was a game-changer since it increased the amount of prep space by 200 percent.</p>
<p>The existing storage situation also made the room feel cluttered as well. The couple was storing things in the space between the tops of the cabinets and the ceiling and were keeping things out on the counter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37012 size-full" title="utensil storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37567" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-15.gif" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Utilitarian needs and modern looks</h3>
<p>The architect placed a pegboard panel on the outside face of a six-inch deep cabinet (used as a pantry to hold mason jars and cooking ingredients). The board, which holds regularly used items such as a knife block, cooking utensils, a basket of onions, cast iron pans, is only visible when someone is standing by the stove. After things are washed, items can be hung to dry, which skips a stop at the drying rack and helps eliminate clutter. They also separated the cooktop and oven so cooking and baking could be done at the same time—a benefit they were not expecting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37540 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14.gif" alt="hidden, refrigerator, kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The most important part of the storage solution design was the wall of book-matched white oak cabinets in the entryway. The cabinets look the same from the outside, but each was designed for a specific need: Cabinet one is an entry storage wall with space for shoes, vacuum, dustbin, and microwave; Cabinet two is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel-ready refrigerator</a>; Cabinets three and four are a double-door unit that houses a modular ELFA shelving system that Joseph and Sunghee already owned.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14-1.gif" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen, 44 square foot kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Brett also discovered an unused pocket behind the cabinet wall where they were able to hide a cabinet that is flush with (and blends into) the sheetrock wall. The cabinet opens on the living room side and houses the couple’s luggage for easy access since Sunghee travels to Korea regularly.</p>
<h3>A limited and complementary palette</h3>
<p>A limited materials palette helped unify the renovated kitchen with the rest of the apartment and complemented the couple’s furniture and art collection. They primarily used rift-cut white oak for the cabinets and shelving because the flooring, dining table, and bench were white oak. They also chose to paint all the upper cabinets white to lighten the mass of storage cabinets above the sink and blend into the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37017 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg" alt="portrait, homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Sweeten homeowner, Joseph</span></p>
<p>Brett, Sunghee, and Joseph are all pleased with the way things turned out. The architect had shown the couple plans in 3D to help them visualize how their kitchen would meet their needs and look the way they wanted it to. Ultimately they created “a spot for everything they needed and nothing they didn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>They enjoyed selecting lighting and tiles, and Sunghee, in particular, loved seeing the contractor work. (She felt like she was apprenticing at times because she spent so much time watching the construction team.) The architect says that he was excited to try some new, well-made high-end materials, such as Heath ceramic handmade floor tiles (set in a herringbone pattern) and custom lighting.</p>
<h3>Architectural experience</h3>
<p>While this project was a first for Sunghee and Joseph, Brett has renovated more than 20 homes (three of them his own). He offers this advice: “Be prepared to spend 20 percent more and for projects to take 20 percent longer, and don&#8217;t live in the space while work is being done.” But it’s not all cautionary. “You can splurge on nice things in small spaces without too much of a financial impact on the project.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sunghee, Joseph, and Brett for sharing this beautiful—and smart—space!</em></p>

				<p>Updated 3/3/2022</p><h3>Should you hire an architect?</h3><p>You need an architect for your renovation, but not sure how the process will go. For a small and straightforward project, consider à la carte services such as schematic designs by a registered architect (RA). For whole-home gut renovations or moving walls, you will need a full-service architect. They can project-manage a renovation from start to finish and help develop a thoughtful design that suits your lifestyle.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p><h3>How much does an architect costs?</h3><p>For residential renovations, architects typically charge a percentage of the construction cost of a project. Urban areas usually charge 15–20 percent for projects budgeted between $20,000–$30,000, and 10–15 percent for $250,000 or more. The costs are essentially the same for areas in close proximity to urban centers.</p><p>Fees, such as permit and application fees, are either fixed or based on the construction costs. Read our post on how much <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/when-do-you-need-an-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architectural services cost</a>. </p><p>To work with an architect on a full-service basis, Sweeten lays out the steps and basic milestones for planning—and executing—a renovation.</p><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1000-Project-Graph-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36282 size-chrono" title="architect process" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1000-Project-Graph-13-723x196.jpg" alt="working with an architect, architect process, graphic, how-to" width="723" height="196" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p><h3><b>Step 1: Initial consultation and field measurements (1–5 hours)</b></h3><p>As the first step, the architect measures your site and creates drawings of the existing space. The basis for starting the design process includes an initial consultation about your vision. Existing conditions provide a sense of what needs to be changed and what is possible. Space limitations, permitting, and budget are considered.</p><p>The architect will produce a few different concepts, which will be presented to you in Step 2 below.</p><h3><b>Step 2: Concept and schematic design (1–8 weeks)</b></h3><p>At the first design meeting, think big picture. “Architects take an extremely collaborative approach with our clients and find this to be at the heart of the design process,” said Sweeten architect Shannon. “It&#8217;s a conversation: clients communicate their goals and intentions verbally. We respond with rendered images and drawings. Drawings are revised as the conversation evolves until we arrive at a client-approved final design scheme.”</p><p>This stage is for considering major decisions such as layout and functionality, rather than the details of finishes. (e.g., don’t worry about the height of your baseboards, or picking a perfect shade of white). Discuss this information with your friends, family, and anyone else who have a say in your renovation plans.</p><p>You’ll give feedback to your architect, and there will typically be another design meeting to refine the ideas that you liked the best. Depending on how prepared you are and how large your project is, this phase could range from 1–8 weeks. Matt, a Sweeten general contractor with a design-build firm, said, “If they come with a mood board and desired aesthetic, the time can be cut down on conceptual design. It also depends on the project. Conceptual design for a loft apartment is going to be a quicker schedule, for example, than the time spent to conceptualize a four-story townhouse.”</p><p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Architect_Project-Graph-5a-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36470 mb-0 size-chrono" title="graphic" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Architect_Project-Graph-5a-1-723x406.jpg" alt="architect process, how to work with an architect" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p><h4>Moving on to materials and finishes</h4><p>Once the plan takes a more concrete shape, your architect creates the schematic designs. This contains details on materials, assemblies, and finishes. Schematic designs are usually refined further throughout the process. But a set (or multiple sets) may be created for submission to co-op/condo boards, as well as for city permits.</p><p>At this point, you will also start to get a sense of the total cost of the project—though this will continue to crystallize as you decide on fixtures, appliances, and finishes.</p><p>“We usually schedule four meetings throughout the design process,&#8221; said Matt:</p><ul><li>Kick-off meeting—a meeting of the mood boards</li><li>Concept design meeting—finalizing the mood board and a basic direction for the schematic design</li><li>Schematic design meeting—present the design options and a material palette </li><li>Final meeting—present the finished plans for any final comments on the drawing set or material palette for the project</li></ul><p>In the permitting/approvals phase, you should begin the <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/what-is-competitive-bidding-in-home-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive bidding process</a> for a general contractor. Larger projects with detailed drawings can benefit from the opinions of Sweeten general contractors who can point out any areas that aren’t included in the plans.</p><h3><b>Step 3a: Permits and approvals (2 weeks–3 months)</b></h3><p>Once schematic designs are in hand, submit them to the appropriate groups for approval. In a full-service project, your architect coordinates all aspects of the permitting and approvals process.</p><p>In New York City, apartment renovations must pass board review, in both condos and co-ops. While condos tend to be more lenient, each apartment building will have specific processes for obtaining board approval. Buildings typically have alteration agreements that you can review so that you understand what is commonly required. In buildings with more stringent rules, they may require you use a specific architect to create the drawings for the board to review.</p><p>Your architect will also obtain the proper permits from the city; this applies to apartments as well as houses. In New York City, this is the Department of Buildings. For buildings located in landmarked areas, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> would also need to be contacted.</p><h4>Waiting for renovation design approvals</h4><p>You have the least control during this phase. Once your architect submits the applications, you are waiting for the board to convene, or the city to review your plans. The initial review may generate additional requests for more documentation or changes. If you start making changes late in the process, plans may need to be redrawn and resubmitted for approval.</p><h3><b>Step 3b: Hiring a general contractor (1–2 weeks)</b></h3><p>When looking for the right general contractor, your architect can play a crucial role in the hiring process; many architects prefer to be very involved. “We can review the bids and point out discrepancies between different estimates,” Shannon said. “We also may ask slightly different questions than the client based on our experience in the industry. For example, &#8216;What is the contractor’s process for handling a change during construction?&#8217; &#8216;Is there a preferred form of communication?&#8217; and &#8216;What is the payment schedule?'&#8221;</p><h4>Choosing the right renovation team</h4><p>The three of you will work together as a team, so it’s important to have a good rapport with both your architect and contractor. It’s equally vital that the two of them have a positive working relationship. You do not want to be a mediator if they have disagreements. Sweeten contractors can often refer you to architects they have worked with on past projects.</p><p>“We often act as an intermediary between the contractor and owner,&#8221; said Shannon. &#8220;We are not a party to the contract between the owner and contractor. This allows us to advocate for the client while speaking the language of construction with the contractor and help mediate if miscommunications occur.”</p><p>The earlier you bring in a contractor, the earlier you can get a sense of the actual <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home remodeling costs</a>. It’s important not to wait too long to bring in a contractor since you want them to be able to evaluate the details of the design and provide accurate cost estimating. This allows you to be ready to begin construction as soon as all the approvals and permits come through.</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p><h3><b>Step 4: Construction administration</b></h3><p>Depending on your agreement with your architect, they may be involved in varying degrees throughout the construction phase of your project. The architect will make regular visits to the worksite, troubleshoot with the contractor, and ensure designs are implemented correctly. In a full-service project, the architect will be the project manager throughout the process until completion—basically, until all the bureaucratic paperwork has been closed out, and the contractor is finished with the renovated space.</p>					</div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Brett</i></span></p>
<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors and white walls and radiator coverred under large window with black frames and recessed lights after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51493" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors and white walls and radiator coverred under large window with black frames and recessed ceiling lights after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51492" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>

<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg" alt="gray bathroom floor tiles and white floating vanity with mirror and toilet and bathtub and floor to ceiling wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51516" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yes, even architects need help with personal home renovations! See how these 5 architect-contractor Sweeten collabs turned out.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it’s time to work on the most personal project of all—renovating your own home—more and more architects are coming to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to help them find the right general contractor (we&#8217;re flattered!) Whether dealing with a tight budget or deadline, navigating a tricky insurance situation, or embarking upon long-awaited plans for their own space, architects need great contractors to fulfill their vision. Join us as we take a look at projects featuring architects who applied their own expertise to the family home.</p>

<h3>Reenvisioning a space for natural light, storage &amp; entertaining</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/open-kitchen-design-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cody and Marissa</a> took down the walls surrounding their kitchen, merging it with the living room to create a multipurpose area that maximized the flow of natural light. Envisioning the kitchen as the heart of the home, Cody designed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot-long island</a> as a place for the family to gather around. He also combined a few closets in the living room into one, large closet to make better use of the space. “We felt most comfortable with our general contractor from day one,” Marissa said, “He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27089 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x1085.jpg" alt="architect contractor relationship" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A guest bedroom renovation challenge? No problem!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an architect, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ana</a> developed the plans for her 2-bed, 2-bath apartment and met with several contractors on her own. She was ready to hire one of the general contractors until a background check led to the shocking conclusion that their office address was an empty storefront. Rather than start a new search from scratch, Ana came to Sweeten. The renovation&#8217;s most impactful update was opening up the office/guest bedroom to connect it to the living room and installing <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom sliding panels</a> that could be used to close off the space whenever privacy was needed. Many of the professionals Ana spoke to said that the sliding panels couldn’t be done because of the oversized dimensions, which would make them too heavy, but their Sweeten contractor took on the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<h3>A tight renovation timeline for a baby on the way</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tina was eager to customize her new home (see <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part 1</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part 2</a> of her renovation), but with a fixed deadline fast approaching—the birth of her first child—she needed to act quickly. To personalize the space, she planned to open up the kitchen, re-tile bathrooms, refinish flooring, add molding/casing, and replace interior doors. “Thanks to our Sweeten contractor and his crew, the renovation process was relatively quick and painless. By having the design decisions completed before work began, we eliminated on-the-go decision-making and were able to work with the team and budget effectively,” Tina said. Her contractor was considerate of the tight <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>, and despite minor delays, the job wrapped just in time for the couple to schedule their move-in a week before the baby’s due date.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21436 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="architect contractor relationship" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A couple and contractor teamed up to tackle a kitchen remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to renovate their newly-purchased fixer-upper, architect couple <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate and Arthur</a> called upon Sweeten to enlist their team. “Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone!” Kate said. While the contractor’s team handled the major work—installing wood floors, tiling, lighting, and appliances in the kitchen and bath, as well as removing the built-in loft in the bedroom—Kate and Arthur chose to paint and assemble the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> in the kitchen (a decision that Kate does NOT recommend for future renovators). The outcome was well worth the effort. “We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn’t have done it without our Sweeten contractor,” said Kate.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_BradCApt-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30463 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_BradCApt-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="architect contractor relationship" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom red, glossy bathroom cabinets come to life</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After experiencing water damage in their home for the third time, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/homeowner-guest-post-brad-and-michelles-modern-fort-greene-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad and Michelle</a> needed to provide realistic estimates that could be used to challenge his insurer’s predictably low ones. Sweeten helped Brad, an architect, find a general contractor who understood the situation completely. While the couple took a week-long vacation, their contractor got to work on gut-renovating their bathroom. Expanding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> in the bath became a challenge when they discovered that the existing glossy red IKEA cabinets had been discontinued. Taking matters into his own hands, Brad designed new ones and worked with Sweeten to find a millworker to execute his vision. Once the cabinets were ready, his Sweeten contractor took care of the installation.</p>

<h3>What is design-build?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms are a growing segment of the construction landscape. About 15% of the American Institute of Building Design (AIBD) members are now design-build firms, said Steve Mickley, the executive director of the organization, which is made up of designers, builders, and architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the name suggests, a design-build firm takes care of both the design and construction phases of a renovation project. Traditionally, the process involved homeowners working with a designer or an architect before taking those plans over to a general contractor to execute the vision. Now, those specialties exist under one roof with design-build. Here, we explain the role of these remodeling professionals.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How are design-build companies structured? </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s no clear-cut definition as to what a design-build firm is and who is in their employ. Usually, a firm will either be more design-forward, primarily led by an architect or a designer, or construction-forward with a general contractor taking the reins. Of course, some firms can be an even balance of both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever the scenario of the firm and your project, “the best approach is to interview as many people as it takes to find someone you feel comfortable with,&#8221; advised Mickley. That could mean going with a design-build firm or handpicking a designer and a general contractor. This more traditional method is called design, bid, and build, or DBB. It is where the designer or architect is hired separately from the general contractor. </p>
<h4>Are professional design services always necessary for a remodel?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not every remodeling project needs a designer or architect. According to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association, only 22% of homeowners renovating a kitchen or bathroom seek professional design assistance. Instead, many chose to work closely with an experienced general contractor on their design to bring down their total costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, if the scope of your project involves structural changes like moving load-bearing walls or shifting plumbing or gas lines, you will at least need an architect or engineer to approve your renovation plans. Bringing in design help is also a good option if you want meticulous planning and attention to visual details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What are the benefits of hiring a design-build company?</h3>
<h4>&#8220;One-stop&#8221; shop</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design-build firms operate as a “one-stop shop” for home construction, said Mickley. This means homeowners only need to explain their vision to one person who then communicates it to the single design-build team. This is also the case throughout the project. If a change needs to be made, no need to discuss it with your designer or architect and then communicate it to your general contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a design-build firm, you should have one point person throughout the entire length of your project who is accountable for the timeline, the budget, and delivering what the homeowner wants. “The same person who has the vision has the responsibility to make that happen,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Project management help</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some homeowners want to closely oversee their renovations. Others don’t. For the latter group, a design-build firm might be a good fit. Rather than the homeowner overseeing the two moving parts of the design and construction phase, a design-build firm watches over both.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a little help with managing a project but aren’t sure you want a design-build firm to take care of the whole thing, some designers or architects may offer a service to help oversee the job. “This is where the designer or architect makes periodic site visits to make sure the general contractor is doing everything to the specifications,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Guaranteed synergy</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s always a risk of a personality clash when you pair two humans together. That includes your choice of designer or architect and general contractor. They could work together seamlessly, or they could not. Working with a design-build firm basically eliminates that risk. The design half and construction half would have worked together on many projects and likely created a firm together based on their positive collaboration. “Depending on the project, you could be working with them for six to 12 months, so it’s best to choose wisely,” said Mickley.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">A faster project</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong with any project and slow the timeline down, including one managed by a design-build firm. However, this type of firm will likely complete a job at a faster pace. A study commissioned by the DBIA found that commercial projects using design-build firms finished about 33% faster than those that used the traditional design, bid, and build process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s reason to think residential projects could also move faster with a design-build firm. That’s because there is likely an overlap between the design and construction phase rather than a lull in momentum when the design phase ends and a general contractor takes up the build phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes you make along the way could also be done faster, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary</a>, who heads up a <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>-vetted design-build firm. Often with the traditional design, bid, and build workflow, a change to your project will require some back and forth between architect and general contractor to see what’s possible and what the best way forward is. This could hold the project up for weeks or more. With a design-build firm, you have your architect and builder already working together and abreast of the project. “Pretty much within a couple of days we can have everything sorted out,” said Gary.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less expensive (maybe)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that design-build is slowly gaining momentum in the residential market, the data isn’t yet available to know what workflow method is easier on the pocketbook. In commercial construction, DBIA found that projects with this category of professionals came in at six percent cheaper when compared with similar jobs using the design, bid, and build workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why you might NOT prefer design-build</h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less control</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned above, a design-build firm generally means less control for the homeowner, which is great if that’s what you want. However, if you know you want to be hands-on with your construction project, take that into consideration when choosing between design-build or the typical design, bid, and build.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Less choice of professionals</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, this can be a pro or a con. It’s definitely a con if you have your heart set on an architect and a general contractor who are not part of the same firm. One thing Mickley advised when considering a design-build firm is to ensure they can produce quality designs. “Some design-build firms call themselves that, but they really don’t possess the design portion,” he said. “They just subcontract that out.”</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">More objective solutions</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having the eyes of a separate general contractor and architect could mean more objective observations about how your project is progressing. It could also mean more ideas. If there’s a problem in need of a solution, you have your architect or designer as well as your general contractor to brainstorm with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sweeten can help you hire the right firm</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless of which way you ultimately lean on your construction and design, selecting who you work with is a crucial decision. “Once you’ve made that decision, you have to give them your full trust,” said Gary.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h2></h2>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block">
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933324509"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is design-build?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms are firms that provide a homeowner with a general contractor, architect, and/or interior designer. They are considered “one-stop” shops because they offer varying services within one company. Design-build firms might be more design-based, some more construction-heavy, and others have a good balance of each. A positive aspect of these firms is communication: because these teams are built to work together, there’s less confusion about responsibilities or how to connect with the renovating homeowner.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1635933385594"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Are design-build firms more expensive?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">Design-build firms can be more expensive to work with than construction-only firms because the service level they offer is higher. These firms are ideal for renovating homeowners who want to (or need to) enlist the help of an architect and/or interior designer, in addition to a general contractor. For example, homeowners doing a transformational gut renovation will likely need the help of a design-build firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Plans include an open kitchen, new closets, oak floors, and embracing the “cons” of Carrara marble</h2>
<p><i>A search for a home to suit their growing family led Marissa and Cody from the West Village to a beautiful spot in northern Manhattan. The apartment, a two-bed, one-bath corner unit, was located on a steep hill in the neighborhood of Hudson Heights. (Fun fact: the building’s foundation sits on a lattice of 40-foot steel stilts!) It came with soaring views of the city, gorgeous light from its north- and east-facing windows, and felt “more like San Francisco than New York City.” The unit’s interior needed some updating, and Cody, an architect, was up to the task. </i><span class="s1"><i>Paired up with a contractor from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors,</i></span><span class="s1"><i> they </i></span><i>knocked down a wall closing in the galley kitchen to connect it to the living room<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>creating an open kitchen design<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>removed a nib wall, and made changes to the bath as well as the floors and closets throughout.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cody says</span>: </i></span>We had been renting a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village for seven years. We started looking to buy an apartment when Marissa became pregnant, and homed in on northern Manhattan to give her a reasonable commute to Columbia University (we had ruled out several neighborhoods in Brooklyn for this reason). Our first impression of Hudson Heights was that it felt like a small village tucked away in the city, surrounded by amazing views and parks. We visited on a snowy winter day, and saw a cross-country skier in the middle of the street!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We continued to look more seriously after our daughter, Lucia, was born, and finally closed on an apartment in March 2016: a two-bed, one-bath, 1,000-square-foot apartment in a 1960s co-op building. Though the postwar construction did not have some of the Art Deco, prewar detailing that is typical of the neighborhood, it did lend itself to a simple and logical floor plan and had thru-wall air conditioning units<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>allowing in even more light than apartments we saw with window units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marissa says</span>:</i></span> Cody is an architect, and we wanted something we could renovate and make our own. While continuing to live in our West Village apartment, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6369" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> to Sweeten and went with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten contractor</a> who was professional, communicative, and direct. The renovation took eight weeks (two weeks under the projected schedule the contractor proposed!), and we moved in just after he finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of our overall vision, first and foremost we wanted to join the kitchen to the living space. We hoped to make the apartment feel open, light, and modern, but warm and homey at the same time. We were drawn to a clean and minimal palette, especially in the kitchen. Cody is an avid home cook, and we knew the kitchen would be the heart of the home. We maximized where we could—for example, with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/refrigerator-chill-world-fridge-freezer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36-inch wide refrigerator</a>, five-burner range, 23-inch stainless steel undermount sink. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six-foot island</a> is our home base, the place where we naturally gravitate throughout the day or when we have friends over.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26378 size-chrono" title="dining room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-26-1-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26360 mb-0 size-chrono" title="shelves for cookbooks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a related note, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-kitchen-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA kitchen</a> cabinet system is amazing for the price point. There are an infinite number of modular configurations and we achieved a result that is nearly indistinguishable from a custom kitchen. The upper cabinets are 40 inches tall and extend to the ceiling, allowing for tons of storage (we never thought we would have empty shelves while living in NYC!). It was important for us to use “real” materials like stone and wood to accent specific moments. For example, we selected the white <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrara marble</a> knowing full well it would take a beating. We loved the idea that every scratch, etch, and stain will continue to give it character over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26361 mb-0 size-chrono" title="view from the kitchen into the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-06-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that an open kitchen design and living area was our primary goal, the first question we asked ourselves when viewing a potential apartment was: “Can we connect the kitchen to the living space?” The existing kitchen in our apartment was a long and narrow galley. Knocking down the wall allowed us to redesign the entire room, maximizing storage and functionality while linking the main living spaces. It also made the room much brighter<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>the window in the kitchen brings in tons more light to the living and dining room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedrooms, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinished</a> the floors with a lighter and more natural oak. We love how they seem to brighten up both spaces now. We also redid the closets in both rooms; in the master bedroom we were able to do the floor-to-ceiling pivot hinges, just like in the living space, but in Lucia&#8217;s room a beam prevented us from doing the same. We were still able to reframe her closet and maximize storage with a new shelving system. We also bought very minimal ceiling light fixtures for each room, which blend in while providing extra ambient light. All of that, plus the square-stock baseboards and door casings, really spruced up both rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26362 size-chrono" title="nursery" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-20-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26363 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-24-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26364 mb-0 size-chrono" title="master bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-25-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also eliminated a small nib wall in the living room that separated the front living space from the bedrooms in the back of the apartment. With the nib wall gone, there is a direct line of sight to the windows in Lucia’s bedroom, which brightens the entire apartment and creates a feeling of spaciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26367 size-chrono" title="office nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26426 mb-0 size-chrono" title="closets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-13-14-1.gif" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of the kitchen and living room project, we also saw the opportunity to reframe the closets throughout the apartment, remove the existing sliding bypass closet doors, and replace them with floor-to-ceiling pivot hinged doors. This created ample storage, and the verticality of the doors and their accompanying hardware became a design feature consistent in every room. The reconfiguration that resulted in an open kitchen design also allowed us to create a new hallway linen closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We made a few changes to the bathroom which made a big difference in the final look. We replaced the pedestal sink for a wall mounted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> which created a lot more storage, replaced the old shower bypass glass doors with a fixed glass panel, and gave it a fresh coat of gray paint. We kept the tiles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting fixtures,</a> and towel racks from the previous design.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26370 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26371 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="open floor plan" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most surprising moment of the whole process was when our contractor sent us some photos after the first day of demolition. There was a huge pile of debris in the middle of the apartment, and a raw opening between the kitchen and living room and around each closet. Beams, columns, electrical conduit, and wiring were totally exposed. It was a shock to realize how much work we were really putting into the renovation. There was no turning back, and we could only hope that all the planning and design preparation going into the project would work out. Eight weeks later, it was a finished project and we could not have been happier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can’t recommend our Sweeten contractor enough. Although his <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid</a> was slightly higher than the others we received, we immediately got the sense that he would deliver a high-quality product, not exceed his budget, and stick to his schedule. All of this turned out to be accurate. We felt most comfortable with him from day one. He and Cody collaborated extensively throughout the renovation, and had a clear line of communication. He did not disappoint us in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that there are many unknowns in the renovation process, and many pieces that are out of your control. Until we knocked down the wall between the living room and kitchen, we did not know for certain what would be behind it. (We had done a small probe to look for pipes, and based on the short span, we assumed that there were not any structural elements.) We couldn’t know for sure the location of the plumbing and gas risers until demolition was complete, which would ultimately dictate where we placed the kitchen sink and oven. It turned out that the gas riser was floating off the perimeter wall by almost 24 inches, and we had initially assumed it would be right along the perimeter wall. As a result, the opening to the kitchen had to be cut short. Although it was initially a disappointment, we used the 24-inch wall as an opportunity to put in a small cabinet and countertop, with wooden shelves above. It ended up being a great addition to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open kitchen design</a>, even though we hadn’t anticipated it!</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26379 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cody_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg" alt="open kitchen design" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our advice to future renovators: make your design choices ahead of time and stick to them. You don’t want to be redesigning in the middle of construction. If there are any surprises during construction (like the location of a gas riser<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>see above), it is critical to make a thoughtful yet quick decision and keep moving forward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with the apartment. It turned out just as we had envisioned it, and it’s been great to have so much space! We had been living in a 600-square-foot one-bedroom for Lucia’s first year, and by the time we moved out, we were feeling very cramped. Now, we’re expecting our second baby, and it feels like there is plenty of room to grow. But if the day comes when we do need more space and we start looking for our next renovation project, we’ll certainly use Sweeten again!</p>
<p><i>What a thoughtful and beautiful redesign, Cody! Thanks to you, Marissa, and Lucia for a glimpse into your home. </i></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home. Read on for Nazli’s take on their plans for the new townhouse, and the full reveal of their guest suite on the second floor. Fittingly, for a family that loves to host, it was the first room finished and ready for occupancy!</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Revamping a kitchen&#8217;s original floor plans can take your space from workable to wow!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a major kitchen transformation is your wish, going beyond swapping out kitchen cabinets or simply replacing existing features, you&#8217;ll want to enlist an architect to make changes to your floor plans.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Architects can see potential in the bleakest and most uninspiring places: Where we see darkness, they see spaces capable of being filled with natural light; where we see dead space and awkward cabinetry, they see new configurations and storage solutions. Whether you decide to work with an independent architect and a general contractor to execute your vision, or hire a design and build firm that can provide both architectural and construction services, chances are you won’t recognize your beautiful new kitchen once it’s done. Read on for five Sweeten kitchens that underwent an about-face in the best possible way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24795 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry and Janet’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crown Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to find a fixer-upper that had a “bring your architect” vibe, Jerry and Janet came across a historic rowhouse that needed major work. After finding an architecture firm, as well as a general contractor, on Sweeten, they set their sights on updating the severely outdated home. New electrical, plumbing, and gas heating were installed throughout the rowhouse, followed by the framing of walls to create new floor plans. The kitchen was relocated to connect both the living and dining room, improving the flow of the home. Since the couple likes to cook, the space was laid out to allow ease of movement with plenty of counter space, and gray-toned IKEA cabinetry was installed to maximize storage space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24796 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A spacious one-bedroom with loads of potential led Joel and Eric to Sweeten to find a general contractor for their renovation. One of their contractor’s references turned out to be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowners and designers Casey and Kumar</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who were brought on board to design the new space. The 1920’s-era apartment had a sunken living room, high ceilings, and lots of ornamental details—as well as a kitchen that was too small and dark. Updates to the floor plans were necessary, starting with a plan to connect the living room to the kitchen. Casey came up with the idea for a unified countertop, a piece that would serve as a bridge between the two rooms with a wraparound counter and plenty of <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> underneath. The peninsula allowed the kitchen to feel much more open and inviting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24797 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="1085" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lia and Chris’ kitchen</a> in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lia and Chris came to Sweeten to make over their two-bedroom, top floor unit with high ceilings, tons of light, and spectacular views. They chose to work with a design and build firm to address the outdated, open plan kitchen that looked out to the living room. The result provided more counter and storage space, filled in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hid the fridge</a> for a more streamlined look. By far the most exciting part of the design included opening up the ceiling and exposing building beams in the living room for an industrial look, with the last exposed beam acting as a visual separation between the two spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20833 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Sophia_Apartment-19-723x482.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon’s kitchen</a> on the Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural light was not an issue in Sophia and Leon’s three-bedroom apartment—they had three exposures during the day that received a ton of light, but none of it ever made it into the kitchen due to its “bento box” layout. Working with a design and build firm that they found through Sweeten, they took down unnecessary walls that completely cut off the kitchen. The new floor plans included a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom-built</a>, open kitchen between the living room and dining room, allowing light to flow through the entire apartment. Open shelving on one side of the kitchen helped transition the space into the living area with storage for books.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24799 size-chrono" title="floor plans" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg" alt="floor plans" width="723" height="483" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-723x483.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23-600x401.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-23.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p>Not wanting a cookie-cutter apartment, architect Tina was drawn to a two-bedroom garden duplex with high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room, a space that she was excited to customize for her family. With the couple’s first child on the way, any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work were eliminated in order to cut down on both the permit approval and construction timelines. Tina completed her architectural drawings before meeting with contractors and decided to work with a Sweeten contractor who proposed an ambitious six-week timeline. Her main goal: to create an open kitchen by removing a floating, non-structural wall that had separated the space from the living room. New cabinets were continued around a corner, transforming the space from a narrow galley into an L-shape complete with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom kitchen island</a>. Semi-custom cabinets were designed around the existing appliances and maximized storage vertically.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>A hunt for more space led Tina Ladd and her husband, Fletcher, from a one-bedroom on Manhattan’s Upper West Side to a garden duplex in a Cobble Hill brownstone. As an architect, Tina was thrilled to be able to customize their new home but was up against an urgent deadline: the imminent birth of the couple’s first child. The transformation was so remarkable, we&#8217;re telling the story in two parts, starting with the parlor. </i></span><span class="s1"><i>Here’s part one of Tina’s vision for the family home—and how she went into labor on moving day! </i></span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Guest post by Tina in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Coming from a one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, we were eager to upsize to a two-bedroom and create a home for our expanding family. We had been looking at listings up and down Manhattan and in a couple of Brooklyn neighborhoods before we found out we were expecting a baby. Four months into the pregnancy (and into intensifying nesting instincts), we went into contract on a duplex in a historic Brooklyn townhouse. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">While we would have been happy with a turn-key apartment, we were both open to renovation work so I could exercise my skill set as an architect and design a more tailored home for our family. With the advantage of a network of design professionals and general construction knowledge, we knew we could take on an appropriately sized project. As we approached a fixed deadline—the due date—we eliminated any options that would require significant structural, electrical, or plumbing work. This would not only cut down on a construction timeline, but it would also eliminate the lengthy review process of obtaining permits from the Department of Buildings and the Landmark Preservation Commission.</span></p>

<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2">As an architect, I didn’t want a cookie-cutter apartment; luckily, my husband, Fletcher, was supportive in my pursuit of something unique. </span>When we attended the open house for our apartment, we were drawn to the high ceilings and 10-foot windows framing the living room. The sun-filled living space was located on the entry parlor level of the townhouse (about five feet above street level), with views directly out to the beautiful brownstone street. The bedrooms were located on the garden level, one floor below. While the 1,200 sq. ft, two-bedroom space checked many boxes on our list, we felt a few changes were needed to turn it into the home we were searching for. The living space was in good shape, and some of it was even recently renovated. However, the kitchen was small and closed-off. Unlike the parlor floor with tall ceilings, the lower, garden level had very low ceilings and felt like a basement. <span class="s2">The previous owners had added some modern touches, and while we both prefer the minimalist aesthetic in certain types of projects, we knew bringing back some familiar character would help make the historic apartment feel more inviting.</span></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-31455 size-full" title="How Sweeten Works" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-Yellow-Round.png" alt="How Sweeten Works" width="288" height="52" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Due to the seller’s terms for a closing date, we were in contract for nearly three months, pushing a tighter deadline. In order to be sure we could hit the ground running with construction upon closing, we discussed major design decisions, and I completed drawings for our anticipated work before meeting with contractors, and ahead of our closing date. At first, we had planned to open the kitchen and re-tile the bathrooms. By the time we were meeting with contractors, our list expanded to include refinishing the floors, adding molding/casing, and replacing all the interior doors. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned to Sweeten</a></span> to find a contractor after seeing an ad during Open House NYC, my favorite Sunday morning TV show. We were matched with three general contractors and decided to move forward with the <span class="s3"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> who best understood our vision and could</span> help us strategically meet our goals. He laid out a six-week timeline—a more ambitious schedule than we had anticipated! To meet our budget, we chose to supply the materials and fixtures, taking advantage of my design industry discounts.</span></p>

<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Our first goal with the apartment was to create an open </span><span class="s4">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. The existing kitchen was separated from the living room by a floating, non-structural wall. By removing the wall and turning the corner with new cabinets, we could transform the space from a narrow galley-style kitchen to an open L- shape with an island.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">From the first time we saw the space, I envisioned a transitional-style kitchen with navy blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a>. I considered both Ikea cabinets with custom fronts, as well as standard semi-custom options. In my first walk-through with the contractor, he suggested a custom cabinet maker that could execute my vision in a more cost-effective way than semi-custom options from a big-box store. Initially, custom cabinets were not in our budget. We were able to construct a kitchen perfectly fit for the space, maximizing storage vertically. We ended up choosing a shaker-style in Newburyport Blue. Simple, budget-friendly 2&#215;8 subway tile in white from Nemo Tile and white Frosty Carrina from Caesarstone allowed the color of the cabinets to really pop. We installed under-cabinet outlet strips and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lighting</a>, which added a level of sophistication.</span></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The previous owners had installed top-of-the-line appliances—a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Wolf range, and stove. Because we chose to keep the appliances, we designed around them. This was one advantage of a totally custom kitchen. We wanted a true <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> for the Wolf range with higher CFM (cubic feet per minute &#8211; a measure of the volume of air that moves heat, odor, moisture, and smoke per minute while cooking) capabilities than a typical over-the-range microwave venting system. The kitchen design didn’t really allow for an alternate microwave location, so we concealed it behind pocket doors in the island. The Sub-Zero refrigerator also impacted our design. The refrigerator door opened away from the cook and prep space in our new layout. Since the Sub-Zero design does not accommodate switching the door hinge side, the island footprint was rotated and narrowed from what we had originally planned in order to provide comfortable clearance.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23544 size-chrono" title="duplex renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-Before-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23545 mb-0 size-chrono" title="duplex renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Christina_Apartment-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing powder room design was very modern. To bring a more transitional feel marrying both traditional and contemporary elements into the bath, we replaced the tile, vanity mirrors and light fixtures for a more classic aesthetic. For the flooring, we chose Nemo’s Fluid basketweave marble mosaic; I love this pattern that was so common in prewar homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we got to work on the master bath and bedrooms which are located in the semi-subterranean lower level—and with shorter ceilings. Making the space brighter and restoring historic charm was the goal.</p>
