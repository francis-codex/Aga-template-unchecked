<h3>Renovation plan: living in the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To say I won the real estate lottery might feel like an overstatement, but after a short hunt, I found a Brooklyn Heights co-op in a 1920s building. It had everything I had been looking for—two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting in new hardwood floors</a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question—and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn’t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn’t exactly scream a clear solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31285 size-feature" title="happy-homeowner-renovated-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Portrait-936x667.jpg" alt="happy homeowner in a renovated kitchen" width="936" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, “brilliant” plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an island, then a peninsula</a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn’t) working for the kitchen.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg" alt="blue cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31162 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the “entry,” but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a drop ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31165 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Two prep zones</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and keep it close to the cooktop/oven. By doing this, I <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created two zones for prep</a> on each side of the sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop/oven, and the refrigerator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31169 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen19-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the way my apartment “boundaries” were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design, there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and “open” storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a “piano” finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I’m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 " style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Consider all possibilities</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I optimistically planned for a “quick” two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor’s work.</p>
<h3>Brighter and more functional home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating my own space as an architect</a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I’m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,  and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they’re coming for dinner.</p>

<h3>Ceramic glass <a href="https://www.subzero-wolf.com/wolf/cooktops-and-rangetops/induction-cooktops/30-inch-contemporary-induction-cooktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a> from Wolf</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you like to cook? Do you like to prepare gourmet meals? Do you entertain frequently? Are you in a hurry to get dinner on the table? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, you might want to check out one of the hottest “new” entries into home cooking today: the induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this type of cooking was first introduced to the U.S. about 70 years ago, it is enjoying a surge in popularity, thanks to a couple of factors. A growing demand for this appliance has lowered prices. You can find some models for under $1,000, or as much as a third of what they once cost. The smooth cooking surface answers the demands of another trend: a sleek, uncluttered kitchen. Finally, the precision and speed of induction cooking draws Americans who are increasingly strapped for time at home and welcome the opportunity to cut even minutes from meal prep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, unpacks the many features of induction to help you better understand what’s available and noteworthy.</p>
<h3>What is induction?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction is a method of producing heat for cooking. It works by creating an interaction between a metal pot or pan and an electromagnetic field below the tempered glass surface of the cooktop to heat the cookware. Induction is the only method that directly uses the cookware as a part of the cooking system.</p>
<h3>How does induction work?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beneath the surface—ceramic or tempered glass—of an induction cooktop rests an induction coil. When the coil is activated (by turning on its control knob or pad), an electrical current passes through this coil, creating an electromagnetic field of energy. Upon contact with that field, the iron molecules in the pan begin to vibrate. It is the friction between those molecules that heats the cookware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooktop surface itself does not emit heat. Rather, heat is produced only when it is turned on and a pan makes contact with the cooktop surface. Once the pan is removed from the cooktop, the magnetic connection is broken and heat is no longer generated. Before the pan makes contact, the cooktop surface, even when it’s been turned on, will remain cool. After the pan is removed from the cooktop, the surface will be warm, but not hot to the touch.</p>
<h3>How does induction differ from other heating sources?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike gas or radiant <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooktops</a>, there is no exposed flame or coil. If you turn on an induction cooktop, it generates no heat until the appropriate cookware is placed in contact with it. Also, the heat is contained within the circumference of the pan or cooktop. As a result, less energy is generated and wasted because the heat is created only within the pan, and not in the surrounding environment.</p>
<h3>Are there distinct benefits?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, all cooktops are not alike. While any heat source will cook food, and cook it well, induction does have standout features that include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Safety</b></span> &#8211; The heat happens in the pan, so there’s no danger of accidentally touching a hot cooktop. This is a particular benefit to homes with children or elderly family members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Accuracy</b></span> &#8211; Precision control at very low or high heat lets the cooktop maintain a temperature to melt chocolate, simmer a cream sauce, or boil pasta water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Speed</b></span> &#8211; The electromagnetic field below the glass cooktop surface quickly generates heat directly to the pan, so water boils faster—manufacturers claim a quart of water boils in less than two minutes—than with gas or radiant heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Energy efficiency</b></span> &#8211; Heat occurs only within the pan where it makes contact with the cooktop, so there’s no energy wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Easy cleaning</b></span> &#8211; A smooth, continuous surface means no crannies where food can catch, and because most of the cooktop stays cool when you’re cooking, spills don’t burn on.</p>
<h3>What else is noteworthy?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The unique cooking function—that electromagnetic field—lends itself to lots of interesting options. For instance, most manufacturers make cooktops with multiple cooking zones that can be bridged to create larger zones for, say, a roasting pan or a Dutch oven. Gaggenau’s induction cooktop makes possible the free positioning of cookware within its combined cooking areas. Thermador offers a memory feature that transfers power settings to another cooking area when the pot is relocated. BlueStar, in addition to a warming burner at 150 degrees, has a Power Boost feature—a 5,500-watt burner that claims to bring one gallon of water in a large pot to a rolling boil in only three and half minutes. Previously, induction wasn’t so good for wok cooking because the coil element couldn’t make contact with enough of the wok’s raised surface. Jenn-Air makes an induction wok module for just that purpose.</p>
<h3>What about installation or replacement?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooktops are made to the same dimensions as comparable gas or radiant cooktops—24, 30, 36, and 48 inches. So you can replace your existing cooktop with an induction version of the same dimensions as long as you have an electrical hookup of the same voltage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to install an induction cooktop over a wall oven, it’s best done with both appliances from the same manufacturer. However, you will want to consult with your contractor and review the installation instructions to make sure they are compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most manufacturers that make induction cooktops will also offer ranges with the induction cooktop option.</p>
<h3>Is special cookware required?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Induction cooking requires ferromagnetic cookware or pots and pans with an iron core, which allows the transfer of energy to the pan. Your cast iron pieces and most stainless steel should work fine. Hold a magnet to the bottom of the pan; if it sticks, it will work. Glass and other non-metallic items will not, however, since they lack the iron core and will need to be replaced if you opt-in for this type of cooktop.</p>
<h3>How about care and maintenance?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the unused areas of an induction cooktop remain cool while you are cooking, most spills and splatters will not cook onto the surface. The exception can be foods with sugar content, such as sauces or sweet potatoes. It’s sensible to wipe up any spills quickly with a sponge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The smooth, continuous surface makes it easy to maintain and keep it looking new—far easier than a gas model with its contours and grates, or radiant, unless it is topped with tempered glass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only use a cleaner made for your cooktop. A regular glass cleaner with ammonia will mar the surface. Also, always lift a pot when you transfer it; never slide cookware, as this can scratch the cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these features add up to lots of choice for the home cook. With so much selection and specialization, where do you begin? When shopping for induction, ask for demonstrations. Many showrooms offer cooking classes so you can try your hand at induction cooking. After all, who doesn’t want a little romance before making a commitment?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tara and Ryan turn an industrial space into a warm family home</h2>
<p><em>Tara, a former teacher-turned-homemaker, and Ryan, a software developer, had always loved the 1800s cast-iron buildings in the SoHo district of NYC. When the couple, who now have a 19-month-old son, had a chance a few years ago to buy into the neighborhood, they jumped at it. Despite the architectural details within their newly purchased loft, the space was outdated and a partial wall was used to create the only bedroom in the home. Here’s the story of how Tara and Ryan <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their contractor</a> to renovate their 1,200-square-foot co-op apartment.</em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Tara and Ryan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, we had the opportunity to buy a loft in a former silk importer warehouse and fell in love with the possibilities. The space showcased several classic neighborhood features, such as cast-iron Corinthian columns, 13-foot tin ceilings, oversized windows, and exposed brick walls. However, it also needed a lot of work. The kitchen and bathroom were dated. The bamboo flooring was uneven. There was no storage and the only bedroom had a divider instead of a full wall. We lived in the space for a few years while we considered our options. Then we got pregnant with our son, Wyatt, so we decided to act fast to make room for our new family addition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our renovation vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design. We wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-expose the brick</a> along the entire length of the living room wall. It was a similar case in the master bedroom, where we wanted to add an accent wall. The columns and original tin ceiling would be left untouched; we loved their rustic, industrial character. That raw look would contrast with the clean, modern, and white gloss cabinetry in the kitchen and living room built-ins that we wanted. The brands we chose were based on quality, modern aesthetic, and resale value.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were unsure of what to expect when the brick in the living room would be exposed. In addition to finding a few more steam, electrical, and drain pipes than expected, we also uncovered a square archway (the brick wall was a firewall running down the center beam of the building and the arch was a former large doorway from its time as a warehouse). During the co-op conversion, these archways were covered by standard framing and wallboard to separate the apartments. However, the feature was aesthetically unpleasing. We solved the problem by covering the drywall and turning it into a “feature wall” with reclaimed barn siding. Finally, we showcased the wall with down-lit recessed lighting—an idea we got from a movie. To keep the décor minimalistic, we made maximum use of our new storage. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> along much of the living room wall are compartmentalized for baby toys, books, media, and our vinyl collection. On the opposite wall sits a desk for paperwork and musical inspiration; Ryan has played the guitar since he was 13 and hopes his son, Wyatt, inherits his passion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen, we essentially kept the same layout. We had looked at several floor plan options that would have potentially altered the kitchen/bathroom layout and location. After exploring those options, we realized moving those “wet” spaces over our downstairs neighbor’s “dry” living room would drastically increase the cost and complexity of our project. We did push the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> out (toward the dining area) about a foot. That improved the ergonomics of the kitchen, particularly when navigating an inconveniently located cast-iron column. We replaced the cabinets, which gave us the flexibility to tweak the functionality, such as replacing the range on the former island with an induction <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. That left room in the island for three rows of deep drawers, which was a much better use of space for storing pans, utensils, and cookware than cabinets. We also found room to add an 18” wine fridge in the island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall and speed oven combination</a> moved to the back wall, formerly dead counter space for a microwave and toaster oven. We did consider whether the column would interfere with the kitchen flow, especially with ovens on the other side. But it ended up working out fine. The high-traffic area (sink, refrigerator, cooktop) is together on one side of the column. The sink, dishwasher, and refrigerator were replaced but stayed in exactly the same locations, requiring minimal plumbing. Even though we added appliances, we gained storage space just by reconfiguring and making better use of the space we had.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29286 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer-dryer combo unit</a> had been in a column directly facing the kitchen island, a terrible location for laundry for traffic flow—and hygiene. The water heater was directly above the washer-dryer, making the whole section difficult to move. The simple solution was to rotate the units 180 degrees, so that laundry door was accessed next to the bathroom, which made more sense. The water heater was left as is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A big priority was to formally close off the master bedroom. Working with a 100-year-old former warehouse came with some challenges. One was a column near the bedroom. Although it is beautiful, it just happened to get in the way of every floor plan. Working with our architect, we had to be creative in positioning the bedroom walls in a way to maximize their floor space while working around the columns. Using <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pocket doors</a> helped solved the problem since the column would have left no room for standard hinge doors. Storage was a priority throughout the loft. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master closet</a> is a wall-sized, reach-in, modular custom closet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For the baby’s room, we took some space from the living room to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-is-a-legal-bedroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the second bedroom</a>. Carving out the space was a challenge when constrained by the column, windows, door placement, and not taking too much square footage out of the master. In the end, we were just barely able to segment an 8-foot x 10-foot room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom had a clean, modern makeover with oversized floor-to-ceiling marble tiles. The floor plan stayed the same, but we were able to make substantial improvements with a few minor design adjustments. Once we demo’d, we found that the half-height wet wall behind the pedestal vanity was overbuilt and could be moved inward. This reclaimed a few inches of space needed for the new floating vanity. We also framed out a LED-lit, recessed shelf above this wet wall, giving the area more purpose. The medicine cabinet was set inside the wall, saving some airspace. These little adjustments made the wall feel a few inches deeper and between the shelf, floating vanity, and medicine cabinet, it provided a lot more storage. Above the bathroom’s dropped ceiling, and with a lot of maneuvering, we made space for the blower of the new ducted central air system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is common in New York City, our apartment was heated with building-controlled steam heat. Our unit got a disproportionate share of that heat. In frustration, we removed the steam radiator altogether while adding a heating and cooling central air system. We also replaced the worn-down bamboo tiles with new white oak <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/">hardwood floors</a> throughout the rest of the apartment, <span style="color: #333333;">which we painted a designer white. </span>It keeps the whole space feeling open and bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was great in helping us realize our vision. They understood our scope of work and did a great job at pairing us with excellent contractor options. Then, they walked us through the contractor selection process, helping us make an apples-to-apples comparison of the bids. The Sweeten contractor we ultimately chose to work with turned out to be an excellent pick. They became true partners in our process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One tip we want to pass on to future renovators is, if possible, rent a place close by so you can check in a few times a week. We did and were able to do weekly (sometimes multiple times per week) walk-throughs with our contractor. That gave us time to plan, troubleshoot, and exchange creative ideas. They also used software to track all aspects of the project, including timelines, material selections, work pictures<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>all of which was tremendously helpful and well organized, allowing us to complete our project within the planned four months. Sadly, a friend’s renovation that is similar to ours and started at the same time is still going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting part of this process is seeing our vision come to life. And getting storage because babies come with so much stuff!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Brooklyn couple who loves to cook creates a waterfall counter as a welcoming perch for friends and family</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-26527" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-07" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project</span>: Open up a tiny kitchen in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before</span>: Amy and Nick were looking for a new home and wanted a place that was either move-in ready or didn’t need a lot of work. Things changed when they came across a 2-bed, 1-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that made perfect sense but needed a complete overhaul, so they decided to buy it and put aside money to make the space their own. The kitchen was outdated and enclosed in a small, triangular-shaped nook in the main living area, while the fridge was awkwardly placed outside of it. Because of the narrow shape of the kitchen, there was limited counter space and no room for lower cabinets. Also, the tile floor in the kitchen didn’t match the wood floor that ran throughout the rest of the living area, a look that made the space feel disjointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: To kick things off, the couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on Sweeten and were matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The gut renovation began with demolishing the walls that made up the triangular nook to make way for a new layout in the kitchen. All of the old molding throughout the apartment was removed and replaced with crisp new trim. The entire apartment was also skim coated—walls, ceilings, doors, and moldings—and given a fresh coat of paint. Moving the sink meant checking under the floorboards to see if the support beams would allow piping to run in the direction needed to relocate it. Most of the support beams ran in the opposite direction, but luckily they switched direction under the kitchen area, allowing Amy and Nick to install the new sink as planned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall counter</a> on the island was fabricated in Calacatta gold marble and continued along the rest of the kitchen prep areas. Amy explained, &#8220;We wanted the kitchen island to be a centerpiece of the room, and we were looking for a surface that was beautiful to fill the space. The Calacatta gold marble slab we chose was the first slab we saw at the stone yard, and we just loved the contrasting veins and its uniqueness. The inspiration for the waterfall was that we wanted to take full advantage of all the beautiful material we had. We also used the leftover marble for the bathroom—it&#8217;s in the vanity, the windowsill, and the threshold.&#8221; The marble also has a honed surface, rather than polished, which helps with wear and tear. To complement the marble waterfall counter and countertops, a large, white elongated <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hex tile</a> was chosen for the backsplash. Storage was added in the form of pre-fab upper and lower cabinets with a glossy, acrylic finish to replace the original wood cabinetry, complete with a custom-made pantry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All new Bosch appliances—dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave—provided a much-needed functional upgrade. <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pendant lighting</a> was added over the island and recessed lighting was installed throughout the kitchen and the rest of the living area to brighten up the space. And if you’re wondering how Amy and Nick feel about the results, just ask Amy. &#8220;We use the kitchen and joint living spaces for relaxing, cooking, and entertaining. The room has all the things that make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Amy found the backsplash tile on Pinterest and searched online for it everywhere until she came across the manufacturer, Pratt &amp; Larson.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style finds</span>: Backsplash tile: Pratt &amp; Larson. Dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, cooktop, vent hood, and microwave: <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>. Pendant lights: <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily&#8217;s kitchen</a>, moving the sink to the peninsula not only added some breathing space, it allowed her to extend the length of her cabinets without worrying about having enough clearance below them for washing up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for Manhattan real estate, you don’t always get what you want. For Gall, a patent attorney who grew up in Florida, an extended search for a new Manhattan apartment took him and his wife first across town, into an unexpected neighborhood, and subsequently through an impressive renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23270 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-723x487.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="487" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gall was living in a Hell’s Kitchen one-bedroom with his wife Ingrid, a Brazilian-born speech pathologist. They initially discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> when they began thinking about a renovation for that apartment. The makeover wasn’t to be, however, and they switched gears in anticipation of expanding their family. For the better part of a year, the couple shopped for a larger apartment in the competitive market along Broadway on the Upper West Side. It was only after widening their search across Central Park that they stumbled onto an affordable Upper East Side building “right on top of the subway,” he notes.<br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23267 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floorplan-543x668.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="543" height="668" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23269 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01-1-720x495.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-01" width="720" height="495" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23263 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-01" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-rise building was originally developed as a rental in the 1980’s, and Gall liked the way its bay windows amplified the view. The 1,280-square-foot unit had received mainly cosmetic renovations since going condo in the early 2000’s, so floors were a deep brown that showed dust and failed to bounce natural light around the space. The original kitchen measured 100 square feet, but felt cramped and closed-off, with a shortage of counter space. Gall, who is the family chef, recalls the well-used beige plastic laminate kitchen cabinets as being very small, and they didn’t go all the way to the ceiling. There was also insufficient storage in the bedrooms. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they fit their clothes,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23381 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23272 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-07-08" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it was a real estate broker’s recommendation which reminded Gall of Sweeten. He <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their remodel</a>, along with a wish list of some elements to add and others to subtract. After signing with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> that offered design and build services in April, demolition began in June. Their contractor worked with the couple for months, strategically updating the apartment while enhancing the expanses of space that had attracted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One early target was a wide bank of awkwardly placed bui</span>lt-in bookcases ri<span style="font-weight: 400;">ght at the entrance. “It had tons of little compartments and really felt cluttered right there in the middle of the house,” Gall explains. They removed it and worked with their team to fill the same space with closed storage. A penthouse they saw while apartment shopping served as the couple’s design inspiration for cool mirror doors—on both their new pantry cabinet and the neighboring linen closet—that are decorated with a retro raised-panel design.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One unexpected (and technically challenging) concern was mentioned by the building architect. For the spot where they planned to open up the kitchen by demolishing a wall, the architect asked about a much discussed but often ignored code requirement for a drop soffit to channel smoke dividing the ceiling between the kitchen and living area. A reworked soffit satisfied the requirement and tied into the other new ones around the living room. To unify the apartment throughout, their contractor suggested </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">they see an example of 5-inch-wide white oak floors in another project the team had completed; Gall and Ingrid instantly fell in love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wood was glued down to the concrete subfloor throughout the living areas, and even in the kitchen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23382 size-chrono" title="Upper East Side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-Before-03" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23276 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23277 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-04" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>he new kitchen has synthetic quartz for the countertops, as well as on the new island where the wall<span style="font-weight: 400;"> once stood. “By opening up the wall we lost a lot of upper cabinet space,” he explains, which made new full-height cabinets a necessity. The cabinets are white-painted maple, and the backsplash mosaic is a herringbone composed of glass and marble tiles. The couple skipped a range in favor of the flexibility of having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/wall-ovens-power-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall oven</a> and separate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooktop</a>. The refrigerator, though not a pricey panel-ready model, is neatly integrated into a tall wall of white cabinetry. The cookspace was one of their favorite spaces. &#8220;The craftsmanship was amazing,&#8221; said Gall. &#8220;The huge countertop makes working in the kitchen a pleasant experience,&#8221; including enough space for him and his wife to cook together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In t</span>he master bathroom, <span style="font-weight: 400;">a tub was replaced with a new stand-up shower with marble from Porcelanosa. Gall praises the three-dimensional renderings created by his Sweeten contractor, which were a great help for imagining the look of the kitchen. “We’re not visual people, and that made the process much smoother and easier.” </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The closet organization in the master bedroom was built to the homeowners&#8217; exact requests, not only providing more than adequate storage, but the cabinet doors matched the rest found in the apartment. For the nursery, the initial placement allowed the rest of the room to be furnished around it. &#8220;The closet was planned to accommodate two children at different ages,&#8221; says Gall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23350 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Upper east side renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Gall_Bathroom-19-1-723x1058.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="1058" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the inconveniences, Sweeten clearly contributed immeasurably to the couple’s renovation. “We had been very nervous about getting the right contractor, one who wouldn’t walk out on us,” he recalls. He advises renovators to expect a longer period of construction than originally quoted, and to spend as much of your own energy on it as possible. Once you find an expert you can count on, he says, &#8220;trust your contractor&#8217;s opinion.&#8221; Mid-construction, they found out they were expecting a child, and the job was finished before the birth. Today, one of those spectacular bay windows in the living room, with its classic New York view, makes an ideal playpen for the luckiest of big-city babies.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-10 size-chrono" title="small space appliances" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08-723x1085.gif" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08" width="723" height="1085" /><br />
<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s a primer on this traditional appliance, but don’t be fooled—telescopic racks, smart technology, and French doors make it a modern kitchen helper</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A wall oven is a very handy appliance in the kitchen, even if you already have one in your range. It doubles your ability to bake, broil or roast, especially important if you entertain frequently, like to cook ahead, or just want to host the holidays with more ease. What’s more, with a wall oven, you enjoy more flexibility with regard to placement, not only for its location in the cook space, but also height.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Wall ovens have seen a lot of advances since the last time you shopped. While you can anticipate the one you choose will operate more accurately and efficiently than previous models, you can also expect to find super-sleek styling, sophisticated digital controls to help you find just the right setting for everything, and of course, self-cleaning. Here’s a rundown of what to look for:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose your heat source</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Probably your first decision will be gas or electric. Your choice will be based on the type of power you already have in your home. Most manufacturers still offer gas, which provides a lower-priced alternative to electric, and more of a moist heat. With electric, the temperature coming from the coils can be controlled more precisely than a gas flame, and heat is radiated from both top and bottom elements. Electric ovens may also offer Sabbath mode, which allows continuous, safe operation over several days without having to turn the appliance off and on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple sizes offer flexibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re replacing an existing oven and so locked into specific dimensions, you have some flexibility here, too. While the most common width is 30 inches, many manufacturers offer 27-inch and 36-inch wall ovens, and you will find some at 24 inches as well as 48. Think about what and how you cook, as you need to consider the cubic-foot capacity, too. If you host the family Thanksgiving, you want an oven cavity large enough to handle that huge turkey. Sizes range from as low as 2 to as high as 5 cubic feet with an average about 4 cubic feet. A large turkey usually ranges from 24 to 26 lbs and can fit into a 30&#8243; oven with 5 cubic feet of interior space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go convection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Available in both gas and electric, a convection oven uses fans to circulate hot air within the oven cavity for faster baking and roasting, as well as the most even cooking. Your wall oven should be able to alternate between conventional and convection, as you wish, but some double ovens may offer one unit convection and the other conventional.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t forgo convenience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Who doesn’t want a microwave oven, even if it’s just for reheating soup or coffee? If space is an issue in your kitchen, consider a wall oven that includes a separate microwave, typically on top. It resembles a double wall oven, but not so tall.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking on the double</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the ’70s, it seemed every kitchen (at least those on TV shows) had double wall ovens and a matching cooktop in avocado or harvest gold. While these color choices have been replaced by stainless steel or a return to classic white or ivory, the convenience of double ovens is worth examining. You get double the function, as mentioned above; while a single convection oven lets you cook simultaneously on multiple racks, a double oven permits simultaneous operation at different temperatures (great when you want the roasted Brussels sprouts to be ready at the same time as the broiled chicken, or to have a pie come out of the oven just as you are finishing dinner). It’s also cheaper than two individual wall ovens (unless you have, say, a kosher kitchen and need to keep the ovens in separate places). Just be sure to plan an adequate landing surface nearby to handle multiple hot dishes that may be ready at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay low-maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What did we do before self-cleaning came along? Perhaps this is where the term “elbow grease” originated. In the past, you had to remove the racks and clean them by hand. Check with your salesperson, as some models now allow you to leave the racks inside while cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warming selection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The warming drawer option first came on strong about 20 years ago, then interest tapered off as wall ovens hit the market with super-low heat and steam features that basically did the same thing. For households where family members eat at different times, or who often host a crowd, and for kosher kitchens, a warming drawer is still a handy appliance worth making room for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other fun features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Bells and whistles come at a price, but you may want to justify it for the added convenience, control, and safety (not to mention time) you gain. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Operation modes have expanded beyond self-cleaning to control lock, as well as delay start and cook and hold—terrific for busy lifestyles! Even the broil function offers some variability to adjust for foods with different requirements, like the golden brown bread crumb topping or the blackened seasoned sirloin steak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Doors are making a statement, too. You’re used to grabbing the handle at the top and peering in while you dodge a blast of hot air to check the progress of your food, right? Manufacturers have responded to this practice by offering larger viewing windows. You can also find wall ovens where the door opens from the side, as well as French doors. A stylistic choice, they’re also ADA compliant, so you may also find it easier to access a dish inside with one of these types of doors (expect to pay a bit more).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Investigate the racking systems. You’ll hear a term “telescopic,” which refers to a system whereby the rack extends fully with ball-bearing rack guides, to prevent tipping when removing heavy items.</p>
