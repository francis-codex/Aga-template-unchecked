<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant renovation costs are hardly a prix fixe situation; they can vary dramatically based on the project. Is it a turnkey situation, where you’re planning to open up in a former restaurant location that already has a kitchen, gas, and electrical? Or are you starting from scratch? The city you’re in will also impact the cost, as will the quality of the finishes and the other professionals you hire for your team. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractor, offers some categories to account for and tips on how to draw up an initial budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.buildingjournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building Journal</a> puts the national average cost for a 5,000-square-foot restaurant with mid-level finishes at $160 a square foot, or $480,000. This can include the build-out, permits, equipment, and design. That cost is higher if you’re based in an expensive city such as New York ($216 per square foot) or Philadelphia ($180 per square foot). &#8220;We tell chefs in NYC who are typically looking at a 2,000-2,500 sq/ft space for a 50-80 seat restaurant that costs can range from $300-350 per square foot for the front of house and $200 per square foot for the back of house,&#8221; says Jonathan Garnett, the creative director at architectural firm MNDPC. &#8220;Multiply that by the 2,000-square-foot space and you have a ballpark.&#8221; Note that this scope does not include furniture, fixtures or restaurant equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What your food and beverage establishment will cost is unclear until you sit down to develop a budget. Here are elements to seriously consider when pulling together an initial budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46400" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png" alt="find general contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Design for a Restaurant Renovation</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For some, starting a restaurant is a creative endeavor, so they prefer to work closely with their general contractor, architect or designer on the design. Some smaller projects like a cafe might not warrant hiring a restaurant designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a huge range: Those looking to bring in a designer could pay as little as $25,000 or as much as $400,000 and beyond, according to Jimmy Haber, from <a href="https://e2hospitality.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESquared Hospitality</a>, which has a long list of successful restaurant ventures all over the world. <span class="s1">The cost depends on the “celebrity” quotient of the designer, whether the space requires a lot of alterations in order to implement a certain design, or </span><span class="s1">how elaborate the decor will be. </span>A restaurant designer won’t just help with the look and feel of the place, but also the all-important layout. The layout will greatly impact the flow of service from kitchen to patron and your staff’s ability to do their job during busy moments. Bringing in an architect early on in the process will provide cost-effective expertise from start to finish, saving time and headache. Basic services include drawing up schematics and submitting the Certificate of Occupancy, but a full-service architect can provide guidance from project management to various levels of interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A designer&#8217;s expertise could also increase the number of seats in the establishment, increasing income in the long run. “By the time you construct and open your restaurant, the mistakes are already there and it is too late,” said Jimmy, on why a designer is worth considering. If you’re big on the creative aspect, then make sure you select a designer who you feel will work within your vision rather than commandeer it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Review the MEPs: mechanical, electrical, and plumbing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is critical to do before even renting or buying a space (if you’re at this stage, read our earlier <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>). Perhaps the MEPs are so far gone you will opt for a different venue altogether. Regardless, accessing the MEPs will help you set a realistic budget. For example, a decrepit HVAC system can blow the budget out by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Dan Soloway, a hospitality consultant with Kitchen Options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In big bureaucratic cities like New York, connecting the gas can take months, which is why Jimmy no longer uses gas appliances in his establishment. He only uses electric to save clients from costly delays of connecting gas.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Permits for a Restaurant Renovation</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fitting out a new restaurant or renovating an existing one will rope in a lot of government departments—the fire department, the gas provider, buildings department, etc.—from whatever town or city you’re in. The actual permits can be a low-cost item on a budget (Jimmy estimates less than $5,000), but getting those approved can add substantially to the overall restaurant renovation cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you sign a lease, always check the <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/commercial-renovations-business-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate of occupancy</a> (CO). This will dictate what the space can be used for. If it doesn’t give permission for a food and beverage establishment, changing it could be expensive and time-consuming, or in some cases, impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you’ve checked the CO, Jimmy recommends spending the $25,000 or so to bring in a mechanical engineer, a kitchen consultant, and a lawyer. That team can look over everything from the liquor license (if the location has one, which is ideal) to the MEPs that we mentioned above. If these areas are not up to par, that could delay the approval of your permits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What if your location isn&#8217;t already approved for a liquor license? It has become increasingly common for clauses to allow restaurateurs to exit the lease if a liquor license application is denied, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. “That’s because the business might hinge on your ability to sell alcohol,” he said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>General construction</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Floors might still need to be laid and bathrooms built or renovated. A survey of more than 700 responses from the industry publication <a href="https://www.restaurantowner.com/public/Survey-How-Much-Does-it-Cost-to-Open-a-Restaurant.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Owner</a> found for a medium restaurant—around 3,200 square feet—construction alone or build-out cost an average $50 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if it is a turnkey restaurant, things like accessibility must be up to current standards, according to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slavica, a Sweeten contractor</a>. Since the Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, businesses and employers are required to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities. This could mean a ramp instead of steps, and bathrooms and doorways wide enough to fit a wheelchair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjJnJjIEXOM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40884 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg" alt="" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/QA-MOV-Link-LakouCafe-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Equipment</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant renovation cost of fitting out a bar and kitchen, including all the equipment like burners and espresso machines, can be a big budget line item. The Restaurant Owner’s survey put the average cost of a 1,000-square-foot bar and kitchen, including the equipment, at about $75,000, or $80 a square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurateurs can buy second-hand equipment, but first, they must do their due diligence. That usually involves spending a few hundred dollars for a technician to look over the equipment before buying it, said Dan, the restaurant consultant. There is also the option to lease equipment, which means a reduced upfront payment, but possibly more in the long run. However, the leasing company normally handles repairs and might even provide things like detergent with a dishwasher.</p>
<h3><b>Rent and labor contingency</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, things can go wrong in a renovation. On average, the Restaurant Owner’s survey found that the overrun on a restaurant remodel budget to be 34 percent. Numerous hurdles can slow down your opening and delay that exciting moment when you make your first sale. Meanwhile, you&#8217;re still paying rent for the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think your pre-opening rent can be a big wild card. It usually takes much longer to open than you think it does,” said Jimmy, from ESquared Hospitality. A six-month rent contingency can be a business-saver, as is a few months&#8217; contingency for staff costs. Sometimes staff members are already hired—manager, chef, sommelier, etc.—and on the payroll when a delay arises. A labor contingency means you can continue paying them during the delay. Otherwise, they could look for new jobs, which means starting the hiring process from scratch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessing and writing a restaurant renovation cost plan is like charting a new land—confusing, tedious, and with a few questions marks. However, having a realistic budget can set you up for success while bringing you one step closer to your dream business. Here is a budget breakdown for a 2,000-<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">square-foot</span> <span style="color: #000000;">restaurant in</span> <span style="color: #000000;">New York City by</span> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Tony</a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Here’s a primer on this traditional appliance, but don’t be fooled—telescopic racks, smart technology, and French doors make it a modern kitchen helper</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A wall oven is a very handy appliance in the kitchen, even if you already have one in your range. It doubles your ability to bake, broil or roast, especially important if you entertain frequently, like to cook ahead, or just want to host the holidays with more ease. What’s more, with a wall oven, you enjoy more flexibility with regard to placement, not only for its location in the cook space, but also height.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Wall ovens have seen a lot of advances since the last time you shopped. While you can anticipate the one you choose will operate more accurately and efficiently than previous models, you can also expect to find super-sleek styling, sophisticated digital controls to help you find just the right setting for everything, and of course, self-cleaning. Here’s a rundown of what to look for:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose your heat source</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Probably your first decision will be gas or electric. Your choice will be based on the type of power you already have in your home. Most manufacturers still offer gas, which provides a lower-priced alternative to electric, and more of a moist heat. With electric, the temperature coming from the coils can be controlled more precisely than a gas flame, and heat is radiated from both top and bottom elements. Electric ovens may also offer Sabbath mode, which allows continuous, safe operation over several days without having to turn the appliance off and on.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple sizes offer flexibility</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re replacing an existing oven and so locked into specific dimensions, you have some flexibility here, too. While the most common width is 30 inches, many manufacturers offer 27-inch and 36-inch wall ovens, and you will find some at 24 inches as well as 48. Think about what and how you cook, as you need to consider the cubic-foot capacity, too. If you host the family Thanksgiving, you want an oven cavity large enough to handle that huge turkey. Sizes range from as low as 2 to as high as 5 cubic feet with an average about 4 cubic feet. A large turkey usually ranges from 24 to 26 lbs and can fit into a 30&#8243; oven with 5 cubic feet of interior space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go convection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Available in both gas and electric, a convection oven uses fans to circulate hot air within the oven cavity for faster baking and roasting, as well as the most even cooking. Your wall oven should be able to alternate between conventional and convection, as you wish, but some double ovens may offer one unit convection and the other conventional.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don’t forgo convenience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Who doesn’t want a microwave oven, even if it’s just for reheating soup or coffee? If space is an issue in your kitchen, consider a wall oven that includes a separate microwave, typically on top. It resembles a double wall oven, but not so tall.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking on the double</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the ’70s, it seemed every kitchen (at least those on TV shows) had double wall ovens and a matching cooktop in avocado or harvest gold. While these color choices have been replaced by stainless steel or a return to classic white or ivory, the convenience of double ovens is worth examining. You get double the function, as mentioned above; while a single convection oven lets you cook simultaneously on multiple racks, a double oven permits simultaneous operation at different temperatures (great when you want the roasted Brussels sprouts to be ready at the same time as the broiled chicken, or to have a pie come out of the oven just as you are finishing dinner). It’s also cheaper than two individual wall ovens (unless you have, say, a kosher kitchen and need to keep the ovens in separate places). Just be sure to plan an adequate landing surface nearby to handle multiple hot dishes that may be ready at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stay low-maintenance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">What did we do before self-cleaning came along? Perhaps this is where the term “elbow grease” originated. In the past, you had to remove the racks and clean them by hand. Check with your salesperson, as some models now allow you to leave the racks inside while cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warming selection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The warming drawer option first came on strong about 20 years ago, then interest tapered off as wall ovens hit the market with super-low heat and steam features that basically did the same thing. For households where family members eat at different times, or who often host a crowd, and for kosher kitchens, a warming drawer is still a handy appliance worth making room for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other fun features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Bells and whistles come at a price, but you may want to justify it for the added convenience, control, and safety (not to mention time) you gain. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Operation modes have expanded beyond self-cleaning to control lock, as well as delay start and cook and hold—terrific for busy lifestyles! Even the broil function offers some variability to adjust for foods with different requirements, like the golden brown bread crumb topping or the blackened seasoned sirloin steak.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Doors are making a statement, too. You’re used to grabbing the handle at the top and peering in while you dodge a blast of hot air to check the progress of your food, right? Manufacturers have responded to this practice by offering larger viewing windows. You can also find wall ovens where the door opens from the side, as well as French doors. A stylistic choice, they’re also ADA compliant, so you may also find it easier to access a dish inside with one of these types of doors (expect to pay a bit more).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">*Investigate the racking systems. You’ll hear a term “telescopic,” which refers to a system whereby the rack extends fully with ball-bearing rack guides, to prevent tipping when removing heavy items.</p>
