										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">Your dream basement renovation is possible. Here are the technical codes to tick off with your contractor.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48554 mb-10 size-full" title="light-brown-vinyl-floor-basement" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg" alt="Light brown vinyl floor in gray and white basement with stairs and banister after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> <span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Tracy and Gordon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> added living space to their small footprint</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many benefits to upgrading a dark, damp basement to an inviting living space. Basement renovations can add significant square footage—and resale value—to a home. And it can be a blank slate; something to reimagine for any of your family&#8217;s needs, including entertaining, working from home, or relaxing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to your wish list, you&#8217;ll need to consider several technical and building code details, such as minimum ceiling heights, emergency egress regulations, insulation, and moisture control. These will influence your basement renovation&#8217;s timeline and cost.</p>
<p>We offer an overview of what would be involved. A vetted general contractor with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement remodeling experience</a> would provide a more in-depth discussion of what is possible in your space.</p>
<h3>Typical costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors have worked on basement remodels starting at $20,000. This price point would update an already finished space and include painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. For a raw space that is being renovated to a finished living area, the average cost is $75,000. With this budget, you&#8217;ll likely be able to include a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The existing condition of the space will always impact the budget. The floor may need to be dug deeper to increase ceiling height. The walls may require underpinning. New wiring and plumbing may need to be installed—guaranteed if you&#8217;re planning a whole new kitchen or bathroom. Insulation and waterproofing may be needed to control condensation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happily, according to our contractors, there are no deal-breakers when it comes to basement renovations. Any problem—bad plumbing, lack of natural light, high humidity, a low ceiling—can all be sorted to create your dream basement. Ultimately, it will all depend on how much you are willing to spend. “It’s a balancing act to how much you want to put into the house before you exceed what value it brings,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan, a Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;You also have to decide if cost value is important to you or is it more important to have a home you want to live in.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Square footage determines a basement renovation budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in the renovation cost, as well as in the value it adds to your home. Sweeten general contractor Kyle says that his smallest basement renovation added just 400 square feet of living space, to be used as a kids&#8217; play area. More typical basement renovations are around 1,000 square feet, he said. And don’t forget: If the basement houses equipment, like a furnace or boiler, a mechanical room could take away a few hundred square feet from the livable space.</p>
<h3>Ceiling height requirements for basement renovations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although building regulations vary from town to town, our contractors say the minimum height requirement for ceilings will be between six and seven feet. You may choose to add more height than this, for comfort and aesthetics. About 50% of basement jobs require the floor to be dug lower to allow for additional ceiling height. This process involves cracking open the existing concrete floor, removing the excess dirt, and re-laying the concrete.</p>
<h3>Creating a second form of egress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you envision creating a living space for your basement, rather than a laundry and storage area? If so, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need a second exit, also called an egress. &#8220;To be comfortable and have no problems with building inspectors, you will need that second form of egress, such as a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level,&#8221; said Kyle, a Sweeten contractor. That usually means digging down to make an open passageway on one side of the building so there is a way to get in and out.</p>
<h3>Basement renovations that add plumbing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, homeowners will add a half or a full bath to their new basement space. The plumbing for this usually goes under the concrete flooring. This will help avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Since your basement living space will probably be below sewer lines, you&#8217;ll need a pump to get waste out, said Kyle. Of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a bathroom</a> will also add to the budget, but for many, the convenience is worth it, he said.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing and insulation protection</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basements account for the majority of your home&#8217;s indoor moisture, according to Alan. On top of the general humidity in your basement, flooding may be a periodic problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to moisture problems is often insulation and waterproofing. There are intelligent products that can help. If a conversion involves a bedroom, it is especially important to control moisture, to prevent toxic from forming. In-wall products like <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/building-insulation/products/membrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed’s MemBrain</a> is an accessory to regular insulation that allows the buildup of moisture to escape while preventing moisture from entering in the first place. Its 2-step installation process will add a few extra days to a basement renovation timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with intelligent products, insulation requires multiple products and systems to stay on top of heat, cold, and humidity, according to Ted Winslow, a representative from CertainTeed. This could mean using spray foam to fill in cracks and seal windows and doors, along with other insulation products.</p>
<h3>Improving basement ventilation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent toxic mold, the humidity of living spaces should be kept below 60 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-course-chapter-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Achieving this often requires ventilation, in addition to waterproofing and insulation. Relying on natural airflow from windows is possible, but its subject to the weather and seasons. Extending your home&#8217;s existing HVAC system will also help ventilate the basement area. However, many basements will require the direct removal of humidity. Kareem suggests installing exhaust fans into the wall or window. These push damp air out while circulating the remaining air around the entire house. This system can either turn on when the lights are switched on, or be equipped with sensors that switch the fans on once humidity gets above a certain level. A dehumidifier is another option, but be prepared to pump that wastewater up to the sewer lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p>If you have the extra square footage of a basement, why not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/3-ways-create-laundry-room-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a laundry room</a> down there?</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in costs. Additionally, adding a kitchen or bathroom to a basement will increase costs considerably, so keep your remodel simple–painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. However, don’t skimp on humidity-controlling features: basements are prone to wetness, causing toxic mold. Be sure to install a good HVAC system, exhaust fans, or a dehumidifier.</p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065183452"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make a basement into a living space</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, make sure the ceiling height is adequate–at least 6-7 feet. You’ll also need a second form of egress, which is an exit from the lower level to the outside. This could be a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level. To create an egress, you’ll need to dig down to make an open passageway on one side of the building to create the way in and out. Basements are prone to humidity, which can cause mold; so install a new HVAC system and exhaust fans.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065198167"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to add a bathroom to a basement</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To add a bathroom to a basement, you’ll need new wiring and plumbing, which usually goes under the concrete flooring. Although it can be costly, a benefit to adding plumbing beneath the flooring is that you’ll avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Additionally, you may also need insulation and waterproofing to control condensation, which can cause mold growth in basements. Since most basements are below sewer lines, you’ll need a pump to get waste out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>

<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">Costs for a bathroom renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>. According to Remodeling’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</span></a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223</strong> in New York. This is based on expanding an existing 35-square-foot bathroom to 100 square feet, relocating all fixtures, and installing a new shower with a frameless glass enclosure, freestanding soaker tub with high-end faucets, stone counters with dual sinks, one-piece toilet, and a humidistat-controlled exhaust fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

<li>This <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/600/Electrical-Fee-Schedule-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Permit Fee Schedule</a> indicates that electrical permits range from a minimum of <strong>$50</strong> for a re-inspection to <strong>$1,000</strong> for additions, renovations, basement wiring, and garages with more than 7 devices over 15,000 square feet.</li>
<li>Fees for plumbing fixtures are <strong>$5</strong> per fixture with a <strong>$50</strong> minimum.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An outdoor kitchen is the ultimate al fresco space! Get ready for a ton of fun (and a good investment for your home)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Westchester home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that Westchester County, with its close proximity to New York City, is one of the pricier areas when it comes to real estate. That is also reflected in the cost of renovations. <span style="color: #333333;">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100 </strong></span><strong>psf<span style="color: #333333;">—$250 </span>psf</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">. Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester kitchen renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our </span><span class="s1">most up-to-date New Jersey </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and New Jersey <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48221" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="710" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts--300x213.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NJ-RemodelingCosts--600x426.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Six Sweeten homeowners weigh in on staying or leaving during their remodel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main points to consider when planning a renovation is how you&#8217;re going to minimize the disruption of daily life. It can be tricky if you are updating a kitchen or bathroom. Living without some elements will make surviving a renovation tough (running water, electricity, Wi-Fi), so moving out while work is being done is probably your best option. But if the renovation won&#8217;t affect your needs in a major way, then you might be able to stay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s1">Here are </span>six Sweeten homeowners who moved out—or stuck it out—during their renovation.</p>
<h3>Moving out during demolition</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-industrial-stairs-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44895 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg" alt="black industrial stairs leading to a living room with orange couch after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Carly&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-loft-balcony-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new apartment</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carly had been looking—and saving—for years to buy an apartment of her dreams. So when she found this 500-square-foot co-op in Greenwich Village, she snapped it up. It was a studio with a  lofted bedroom and balcony—what more could she ask? It did need work, however. She wanted to literally raise the roof in order to enclose the loft bedroom and redo the kitchen. The entire renovation took five months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interest of surviving her renovation, Carly decided to move out during the messiest part of the process: the demolition and raising the roof.  &#8220;For much of it, though, I was there,&#8221; said Carly. &#8220;I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases.&#8221; But she doesn&#8217;t regret &#8220;slumming it.&#8221; &#8220;The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Airbnb-hopping</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33695 mb-10 size-chrono" title="brown-wooden-floor-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg" alt="brown wooden floor for breakfast nook and living room with blue wall separator after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment combination</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining their apartment</a> with the unit next door eliminated the option of living at home when work began. Since the scope of work extended beyond demolishing walls and the two existing kitchens to build a new one,  Zoe and Arvid moved into a short-term sublet. The couple embarked on an Airbnb-hopping adventure when their lease ended before the work was done. They then decided to live on-site for the second half of the project.</p>

<h3>Expecting while renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Lindsay and Roger&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating the kitchen while nine months pregnant made getting around the apartment a challenge for Lindsay. &#8220;You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere,&#8221; she said. To make it work, she moved everything from the kitchen and living room into the nursery. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-best-renovation-advice-from-sweeten-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future renovators</a>, she recommends going away for a weekend during heavy construction.</p>

<h3>Surviving their renovation: A couple toughs it out</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-frameless-glass-separator"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44896 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg" alt="white bathroom with frameless glass separator for white bathtub and floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Sharon and Laurence&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/large-scale-tile-financial-district-bathroom-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence lived in their Financial District apartment for more than two decades before renovating their bathroom. They previously had remodeled their kitchen but were wary of redoing their bathroom. The couple only has one in their apartment so they thought it being out of commission would be tough. Sharon and Laurence ultimately decided to stay in the apartment during the renovation. It wasn&#8217;t ideal but they used a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently.</span></p>

<h3>Moving into a rental</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-minimalistic-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44897 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="large minimalistic living room with black framed glass door and two large windows after renovation" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) The light-filled renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For their family of five, these homeowners wanted an open and airy space. That meant renovating their Upper West Side home, adding another bedroom and bath. They also knocked down walls and updated their kitchen. They turned to Sweeten to find a reliable contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to take their three boys (and two dogs) and move into a rental while the work was being done. “When I told our Sweeten contractor that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that. Even though we lived there without a kitchen, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Neighbors offer hospitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20250 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Nikki and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment renovation</span></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nikki and Chris had to get creative to manage the challenges of being in the space mid-construction. &#8220;Through this experience, we showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week,&#8221; Nikki said. But it was all worth it to see the daily progress and watch the couple&#8217;s vision come to life. The routine became so natural that the couple&#8217;s pug started waiting at the door each morning to greet the contractor&#8217;s team when they arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The decorative trim of crown molding adds timeless character and visual appeal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43509 size-full" title="baseboard, crown, mantelpiece molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Molding and picture frame molding by</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;list&quot;,{},&quot;list_item&quot;,{&quot;indent&quot;:1,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numbered&quot;}]"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-25575 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">p<span class="s1">anel molding, painted a deep teal blue, gives their dining room personality.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also consider UL-Listed hollow crown molding that can hide common household wiring, good for a home office.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40332 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1">A salvaged slab of walnut picked up at a reclaimed wood supplier took centerstage in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Brian</a>’s kitchen. “I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said. Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A kitchenette found new life in its studio loft with new <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Serge and Uldis</a> who worked to make full use of all of the space available. Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>

<h3>A new art deco apartment home<span>—in need of work</span></h3>
<p>Lindsay, Nicholas, and their cat, Sibyl, returned to New York City after two years in Baltimore and landed on a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in upper Manhattan. “Nicholas fell in love with the [art deco] lobby, and we both loved that it was right across the street from Inwood Hill Park and has a killer view of the Cloisters,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p>The apartment itself was so-so. It had some classic art deco features, like a sunken living room with herringbone wood floors, which Lindsay and Nicholas wanted to mix with their mid-century tastes. A bland kitchen and bathroom needed some help. The molding, doors, and paint were also due for a refresh. And then there were those two things many New Yorkers consider an ultimate luxury<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washing machine and dryer</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="Brooklyn renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-22-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that pairs renovators with vetted general contractors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/9735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their art deco apartment remodel</a> and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-build firm</a> to execute the construction and the design. Lindsay and Nicholas were given a six- to eight-week timeline from start to finish and camped out in a sublet during the renovation. A few hiccups along the way stretched that timeline (more on that later).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The plan was to gut renovate the bathroom and make minor changes in the kitchen while doing mostly cosmetic updates to the rest of the apartment. A standout feature in the living area is the sliver of wallpaper that peaks out from the small hallway off of the living room. “Since it’s such a small space, we figured we could go a little crazy,” said Lindsay. That “little crazy” translated to an art deco-style wallpaper with teal, purple, and gold accents. “Even our friends who hate patterns and bright colors love it,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p>Salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted.</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the current layout had a nook where the previous owners had placed a small breakfast table. Lindsay saw this as an ideal way to add more counter space. There was a miniature dishwasher “which made no sense since there was plenty of room for a full one,” said Lindsay. Rather than <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gut renovate</a> the kitchen (a decision the couple later regretted), they refinished the existing “country-style” cabinets in a gray modern tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark grout in the backsplash tiles upped the modern feel. The only appliance they replaced was that tiny dishwasher. “We are happy with how it came out,” said Lindsay, “but salvaging some of the kitchen turned out to be more work than a full gut. It would have been better to just pay extra and get what we really wanted,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the only original feature that remains is the cast-iron tub with its detailed edges. Lindsay and Nicholas had it re-enameled so it matched the new bathroom. A new washer/dryer would replace an existing shower area and a shower would be added to the bathtub. For maximal storage, shelving lined the laundry wall in hard-to-reach places and double doors were installed to hide the clutter.</p>
<p>When the decision came to choose either a console sink or a vanity, they decided on a console. (The under-the-sink space became the new location for Sibyl&#8217;s litter box.) For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a>, a large medicine cabinet, and niche shelves along the bathroom and shower walls did the trick. A matte black hexagonal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tile</a> became the new backdrop in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp" alt="black and white bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-57241 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/9735-Lindsay-Apt-06-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A feature the couple recommends to other renovators is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>. To remedy some oddly-placed shelves and a rod, their Sweeten contractor ripped everything out of the bedroom closet and installed a new system that can easily be changed later on as storage needs shift. “Custom designing the closets made a huge difference in how useful the spaces were,” said Lindsay.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN_Lindsay_Apartment-04.gif" alt="Washer dryer renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project hit a major snag when it came to the electrical work which pushed the end date back. Wiring dedicated to powering the washer/dryer had to be installed and ripped out twice from the ceiling. Despite this, it still shorted out the power after only a few uses. In the end, it was discovered there was a faulty part in the basement and the situation was fixed. Throughout the issue, Sweeten&#8217;s customer service, which checks in on renovations until projects are completed, stayed in communication until it was resolved and helped coordinate a new realistic timeline agreeable to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After their experience, Lindsay and Nicholas came out with a home they loved, but also some things they would do differently next time. “Always gut renovate,” said Lindsay. “We were trying to be thrifty by keeping the kitchen cabinets.” The other tip: plan for the renovation to take twice as long. But ultimately, the Sweeten contractor did a fantastic job,” said Lindsay<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and enhanced the features of the apartment to turn it into a unique home for their family.</p>

Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40097 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="family room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Sandra-Soto-Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Sweeten homeowners have either just moved into their new space, or are renovating their home to stay put. Increasingly, we are seeing renovation projects aimed at resale. Whether you’re planning to put your space on the market soon or in several years, it’s smart to keep in mind the potential for resale, especially if you know you&#8217;ll outgrow your current home. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a clever way to approach your renovation: making it comfortable and customized to your needs, while increasing your home’s attractiveness to potential buyers. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers an overview of the best home upgrades for resale value.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46407 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Should You Remodel for Resale?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re moving sooner rather than later, your renovation should be strategic and targeted in the areas that will create the biggest difference to buyers with minimal cost to you. Walk around your home with your real estate agent and discuss whether there are any basic improvement projects that might facilitate a quick sale for top dollar. While decluttering and staging should be the first steps, some homes do need some extra work. If yours falls into this category, <b>ask yourself the following questions:</b></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I willing to accept a lower price per square foot to compensate for the condition of the home?</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I scared off by the hassle of a renovation project?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer to both questions is no, it sounds like a renovation might be in your future!</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Apartments</h3>
<p>If you live in an apartment, there is usually another entity—a co-op or condo board—in conjunction with a management company, who is responsible for the upkeep of the building systems and its exterior, as well as any landscaping. Neither you nor the buyer of your apartment will need to deal with these issues personally (unless you’re on the board, but that’s a whole different story.) As an owner, you’re responsible for “walls-in,” so it makes sense to focus on cosmetic improvements that will help your apartment show better.</p>
<h3>Renovating for resale: Houses</h3>
<p>The priorities are different when renovating a house for resale. Since homeowners are responsible for the whole building and the lot on which the house sits, there will likely be more pressing concerns beyond the color of the bedroom walls. (Also, buyers of townhouses generally expect to do some work on their new homes after closing.) This means that your money shouldn’t go to renovations but to repairs: ensuring that all systems are in good working order, that there are no structural issues, and that nothing on the exterior needs immediate attention.</p>
<p>You’ll generally have to dig deeper into your pockets to fund these types of projects, but it’s likely that your house will sit on the market if you don’t address them. If you don’t deal with pressing repairs, and they come up during inspection, expect the buyer to ask for credits at closing in order to compensate for them.</p>
<h3><span class="s1">The best interior </span><span class="s1">home upgrades for </span><span class="s1">resale value</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tip: Focus your time and money on remodeling the most visible parts of your home. This approach tends to bring the best value (we’ll address exterior updates further down.) These are the interior, whole-room projects that recoup the most home resale value according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s 2020 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value Report</span></a>:</span></p>

<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Add a fresh coat of paint. </b>Especially if the current colors are very bright or unusual. You might love lime green, but it’s safe to say that many buyers won’t. Many homeowners can repaint themselves, but sometimes, it’s worth calling in the pros.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Change out kitchen cabinet fronts.</b> You can do this in a few different ways—simply sanding and repainting the existing surface is the most budget-friendly, or you can choose to replace the doors and hardware while leaving the interior boxes in place. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Swap out your fixtures.</b>  If your lighting and plumbing fixtures look like they are from the ’80s—and not in a good way—consider switching them out. You don’t need to go high-end; there are plenty of good-looking options at big box stores. Our suggestion? Pick something with clean lines and classic finishes. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Refinish your floors.</b> If they are scratched, peeling, or look damaged, this is a must. Any sign of water damage, for example, is not only an aesthetic problem but is also an indicator to buyers that there may be a history of leaks in the building. And if you have carpets…this is a huge turnoff for many buyers, so consider replacing them.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Rip out outdated trends that serve no function</b>. This applies to vinyl faux-wood paneling, weird glass block walls, and “decorative” room dividers that are now just eyesores.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Single-space </span><span class="s1">home upgrades</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Kitchen updates.</b> This is an important room for buyers and is often immediately visible upon entering an apartment, so you’ll want to focus your attention here. In addition to refurbishing the cabinet doors, replace the hardware and fixtures. You can also go further and replace the countertops and backsplash. Visually, these make the biggest impact. If you have a very dark kitchen, going lighter will appeal to buyers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom updates. </b>After the kitchen, this is the most important space in an apartment. Particularly if there is just one—it’s important to make it look functional and clean. The easiest and most affordable ways to update the bath are to paint and change out the medicine cabinet mirror for an updated model. Updating the tile, vanity, and reglazing the tub will also be good ways to freshen up the space.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>“Flex space” addition</b>. While it’s impossible to add actual square footage to an apartment (unless you’re <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/"><span class="s2">combining apartments</span></a>), it’s often helpful to add the idea of one. This can be done by putting up pressurized walls to carve out an office nook, or by adding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/"><span class="s2">sliding doors </span></a>across a large living room to create a den space. While this type of renovation won’t change the legal designation of the number of bedrooms in your unit, it helps buyers envision more uses for the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">The best exterior home upgrades for resale value</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An upscale garage door replacement that costs $3,695 has a resale value of $3,491 and recoups <b>94%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing vinyl siding with mid-range manufactured stone veneer costs on average $9,357 has a resale value of $8,943 and recoups <b>95%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">A mid-range wooden deck addition that costs $14,360 has a resale value of $10,355 and recoups <b>72%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-range fiber-cement siding replacement that costs $17,008 has a resale value of $13,195 and recoups <b>77%</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Replacing a mid-range steel entry door for a cost of $1,881 has a resale value of $1,294 and recoups <b>68%</b></span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Curb appeal project ideas</h4>
<p>Curb appeal catches the eye of prospective buyers. Consider these exterior ideas to boost a home&#8217;s resale value:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repair the driveway<b> $1,000-$5,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Spruce up the house number <b>$10-$100</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Invest in landscaping <b>$200-$2,000</b></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Repaint the exterior<b> $5,000-$15,000</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember: </b>In highly localized markets, like metropolitan cities, it’s important to make decisions in consultation with your real estate agent. What works in one neighborhood might not work in another. They will be the best person to guide you on where it makes sense to invest in a renovation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keep in mind you don’t need to spend a lot of money to upgrade your home. Weigh the financial and time costs, and consider whether you’d take a lower purchase price to save yourself the trouble. And remember, it’s not about recouping the exact value of the renovation in the sale price, but getting buyers to make offers in the first place!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Be open to the idea of unconcealed storage  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how big your bathroom is, the first thought to reduce clutter would be to keep it all tucked away in drawers and cabinets. But when things are out of sight, they are also harder to find. Strategically-placed open shelving adds visual interest and can make life a little easier. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has seen many renovators creatively add open storage to their baths. From recessed open shelving to floating shelves, see what ideas you might want to incorporate in your own bathroom renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27546" title="recessed shelving" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria and Eric’s small bath needed storage that would blend seamlessly with their minimalist Scandinavian apartment. A </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recessed wall unit with open shelves </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the perfect solution. Plus, hiding it behind the door means it’s only visible when the door is closed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38081 size-full" title="black-and-white-bathroom-with-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg" alt="white subway tiles with black grout and black shower head and fixtures and bathtub and floating wooden shelves above toilet and vanity with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classic open shelves</a> are always a good idea. In Saira’s bathroom, they provided extra storage for the family of four and brought contrast to the otherwise black and white space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38622 size-full" title="hexagon-wall-tiles-and-recessed-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="off-white hexagon tiles on walls and white bathtub and recessed shelves on wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Erica-Forrence-Bathroom-08-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica’s general contractor took open storage to the next level with </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/zen-bathroom-renovation-windsor-terrace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shower niches featuring glass shelves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The integrated organization idea is as practical as it is pretty.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27548 size-full" title="glass shelves in bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="glass shelves in bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A storage niche was already part of the original bathroom layout in Katie and Lance’s apartment. They removed the tired and off-kilter shutter doors and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-uber-chic-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed clear shelves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38192 size-full" title="concrete-walls-with-wooden-shelves" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="concrete bathroom walls with floating wooden shelves and toilet and floor tiles and bathtub with glass wall and light gray tiles on wall after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Karun-Aulakh-Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun fact: The shelves in Karun’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/concrete-bathroom-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">industrial-inspired bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are made from a tree that fell in his sister’s backyard. To add to the edgy look of the space, he chose exposed pipe brackets to hang them, too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27549 size-full" title="vanity mirror and shelf" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ed_Hazlett_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed and Alicia opted for trough sink instead of a more traditional sink/vanity and needed to find storage elsewhere in the bath. The mirror above </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubles as a shelf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and on the adjacent wall they installed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1940s American Red Cross medicine cabinet as another storage option. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27598 size-full" title="countertop ledge" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-04.jpg" alt="bathroom opening shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ledge in Joe and Mario’s new bathroom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which extends from the sink countertop over the toilet, provides </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extra space for decorative items or toiletries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and makes use of what otherwise would be lost space. </span></p>

<p>Creating a budget for a renovation is unique to every project; the many variables, from your own taste for materials and quality of work to whether you are changing the layout or are moving plumbing or gas lines in a kitchen or bathroom, all factor into the equation.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, has compiled a general guide to renovation costs in Fairfield County focusing on four categories—kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>

<h2>What a Connecticut home remodel cost per square foot</h2>
<p>The general range for a gut renovation in Fairfield County, CT is <strong>$150</strong> to <strong>$250 psf</strong>, according to Elizabeth, an architect in the Sweeten network. That price can easily sneak up to <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$350</strong> a square foot, she advised, depending on how complex your renovation is (structural issues, layout changes, etc.) and how expensive your tastes are in terms of fixtures and finishes. Those figures also do not include fees for architects and engineers who might be necessary throughout the course of the project.</p>
<p>Residential renovation costs have increased on average <a href="https://edzarenski.com/2018/11/16/2019-construction-economic-forecast-dec-2018e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.7% each year</a> between 2013 and 2018. For most contractors, cost increases or decreases in all areas—labor, materials, etc—can fluctuate year to year and even throughout the year. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Oziel</a>, who works in Westchester as well as Fairfield, also pointed out that finishes—tiles, flooring, countertops, lighting, appliances, faucets, etc.—go up each year, as do overhead costs for workers compensation and general liability insurance.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry, a Sweeten contractor</a> in Fairfield County, said he tries to absorb the increases in insurance costs. He also said that while construction items go up every year, most of the increase goes to framing and electrical materials. Sweeten architect Elizabeth noted that a shrinking construction labor force in wealthy areas raises the price for skilled plumbers, electricians, and framers.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut kitchen renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.  <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has done a budget kitchen for <strong>$40,000</strong> that was 150 square feet. This budget includes semi-custom cabinets and granite or quartz countertops with no changes to the layout.</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: A typical mid-grade kitchen renovation in Fairfield County is priced at <strong>$335 psf</strong>, or <strong>$67,000</strong> according to the Cost vs. Value report. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with laminate countertops, a standard sink, and faucet, with an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes a garbage disposal, custom lighting and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork. New kitchens that Elizabeth’s architectural firm has worked on usually cost between<strong> $25,000</strong> to <strong>$60,000</strong>, but it is easy to surpass that, she said.</li>
<li>High-end kitchen: For a kitchen renovation, this could mean fully custom cabinets, sourcing the best materials from overseas, and dealing with the added expense of a layout change, said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfonso, a Sweeten contractor</a>. A recent kitchen renovation he worked on came to <strong>$125,000</strong>. The cabinets alone were <strong>$70,000</strong>, the countertop material was shipped in from Italy, and changing the layout of the kitchen also bumped up the cost and involved substantial plumbing and electrical work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example Alfonso used came in a little under the Cost vs Value report’s average price of a high-end kitchen of <strong>$133,000</strong> or <strong>$630 psf</strong>. This includes more expensive materials such as stone countertops, an imported tile backsplash, a water filtration system, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, plus a built-in microwave unit.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut bathroom renovation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Budget bathroom: Sweeten bathroom remodels can start at<strong> $15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot. Majid has worked on projects costing <strong>$15,000</strong> for a minimum space measuring 5’ x 8’ that includes labor and rough materials. A budget of <strong>$15,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> is typical for a full bathroom renovation in the Fairfield area, according to Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Fairfield County, Connecticut will cost on average <strong>$21,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report which equates to <strong>$600 psf</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity country, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.</li>
<li>High-end bathroom: That same report put a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at<strong> $66,500</strong>. The sample bathroom was expanded from 35 square feet to 100. It amounted to <strong>$665 psf</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the more expensive bathrooms Alfonso worked on came in at <strong>$88,000</strong>. This included a walk-in closet that led into the bathroom. The client wanted a custom-made European toilet, major structural changes, and marble shipped from Italy, which had a lead time of three months for delivery.</p>
<h2>Costs for a Connecticut basement renovation</h2>
<p>Basement renovations by Sweeten contractors have ranged from <strong>$30,000</strong> to<strong> $100,000</strong>. An average basement conversion across the county is <strong>$75,000</strong>, according to the Cost vs Value report. The project for this size budget includes a 20′ x 30′ room and a 5′ x 8′ bathroom with a shower and a bar area as well as insulation and laminate flooring, which comes to <strong>$117 psf</strong>.</p>
<p>The elements that tend to inflate the budget include adding a toilet or a shower and work needed to bring the room up to code. Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (so adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor.</p>
<h2>Costs for permits</h2>
<p>Each town in Fairfield County has its own table of fees for building permits. Building permits, including those for plumbing and electrical, can cost anywhere from <strong>$300</strong> to <strong>$2,500</strong> per project. The variation is often tied to your budget. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Stamford, your building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each $1,000 in your budget. That permit will cover your electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work.</li>
<li>In Westport, the permit fee for demolition is <strong>$2</strong> per 100 cubic feet of volume while the building fee is <strong>$10</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> of the renovation budget.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.greenwichct.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8484/FEES-2018-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenwich</a>, a building permit will be<strong> $13.26</strong> for each <strong>$1,000</strong> in your budget. The electrical permit fee is <strong>$12</strong> per <strong>$1,00</strong>0 of the cost of the project; this fee is the same for a plumbing permit fees.</li>
<li>Over in <a href="https://www.norwalkct.org/128/Fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norwalk</a>, building fees are structured slightly different. A building permit costs <strong>$13</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> of estimated work, which includes some electrical, plumbing, and HVAC work. However, if there are major changes in these areas, then separate permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC might be required at a cost of <strong>$13.26</strong> for every<strong> $1,000</strong> budgeted in those areas. Check the building department in your local township for a better idea of permitting costs for your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues you may or may not encounter along the way such as structural problems that need fixing or bringing a staircase up to current code could also manipulate your end budget. Take into consideration wet areas like kitchens or bathrooms cost more to renovate than dry spaces (for example, dining rooms and bedrooms) due to materials and labor that may be more complex, Alfonso says.</p>
<p>Hopefully, all of these facts and figures give you a jumping-off point to begin pulling together a budget.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are that once you find the right townhouse (good bones, ideal location, right price) in New York City, the space is going to need some work. After all, many of these houses—particularly classic brownstones—date back to the late 1800 and early 1900s. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke to Sweeten’s founder and CEO, Jean Brownill, and <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/chris-halliburton?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Halliburton</a>, associate broker of investment sales at <a href="https://www.compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compass</a>, to put together a comprehensive guide about the questions to ask before you buy and how to get started on your townhouse renovation plan once the papers are signed, sealed, and delivered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Questions to Ask During Your Search for a Townhouse</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a townhouse to renovate, you probably already have an idea of the kind of home and lifestyle you’re looking to create. Perhaps you&#8217;re tired of neighbors stomping above you and dealing with your restrictive co-op board, or you are drawn to the dream of owning your very own roof terrace and backyard—aren’t we all? Or maybe you’d also like rental income to offset the cost of home ownership, or you’re an investor looking to maximize rental income.  Whatever your motivations, your townhouse renovation search should be narrowed to the properties that will allow you to create the lifestyle you’re looking for. Here are the questions to ask during your search.</span></p>
<h4><b>1.) What’s the building’s history?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you gather information about the soundness of the property. New York City’s </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/index.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Buildings (DOB)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a great site where you can look up the history of the property and see the violations, complaints, as well as applications and permits for prior work done to the property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for red flags, and use the information to determine whether prior work—especially structural changes or alterations to the plumbing, electrical, and mechanicals—has been executed properly. </span><a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property Shark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another place where you can access comprehensive, publicly available information about the property in question.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-brown-floor-white-kitchen" class="alignnone wp-image-31419 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg" alt="white kitchen with brown floor and white kitchen cabinets with recessed lights on ceiling after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Rayhan-Ahmed-Townhouse-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) </em>AJ and Ray’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-townhouse-renovation-makes-a-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>2.) What’s the actual square footage versus the buildable square footage?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many townhouses are on lots much larger than the current building footprint. For example, brownstones are often on 100-foot lots, but the building itself may only be 20’ x 35’. Chris explains that these properties can often be built back with extensions ranging from ten to 30 feet long, depending on the floor area ratio (FAR). The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/residence-districts-r1-r10.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAR is determined by the zoning designation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in New York City, the Zoning Resolution designates ten residential districts. For example, a lot that is 20’ x 100’ in an R7-2 zone that has a FAR of 3.44 allows you to put up a 6,880-square-foot building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be able to expand vertically. This is almost always a given, Chris says, although you may be constrained by landmark preservation requirements (see below). Similarly, you should explore excavation possibilities for creating a cellar. While below-grade space is not counted in the square footage, it is often useful to add space below for mechanicals or storage, even if it is not livable. By storing these elements underground, you can free up space above grade to maximize your living space and/or rental income potential.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29890 mb-10 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above)</em> Marsha and Adam&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">townhouse renovation</a></span></p>
<h4><b>3.) What are the existing conditions?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information that you gather via city databases, pay attention to the existing conditions of the building. Are there signs of water damage, mold, or termites? Also be aware of outside forces beyond an owner’s control—is there a lot of ongoing or planned construction in the area?</span></p>
<p>If there is an empty lot next door, find out what is happening there. Chris points out that the construction of tunnels for the Second Avenue subway expansion was a major issue for surrounding properties, not only in terms of noise and inconvenience but also with structural damage related to shifting foundations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it currently a single-family dwelling that you intend to turn into a two-family? Or vice-versa? Be prepared to hire an architect if so.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1bZ07c4-A0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40881 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/QA-BrownstoneReno-1-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h4><b>4.) Is the property landmarked or in a historic district?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/lpc/about/about-lpc.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landmark Preservation Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is New York City’s governing agency for preserving buildings and sites that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant. Many brownstone townhouses happen to be in designated historic districts—there are a total of more than 36,000 landmark properties in 141 historic districts and extensions throughout the five boroughs, according to the LPC’s website.</span></p>
<p>If the townhouse you’re considering is protected, you will need to submit any planned changes to the LPC for review at the same time that you submit plans to the DOB. Chris explains, “Anything that the LPC approves will be approved 99 percent of the time by the DOB. But it’s not the case vice versa.” In particular, any changes to the façade will be scrutinized by the LPC. For example, while a back extension will not affect the view of the building from the street, adding floors will. If you want to add to the top of the building, you may be required to start 20 feet back from the front of the building, so that the additional floor can’t be seen from the street.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LPC review will add extra time to your townhouse renovation, so this should be a consideration, especially if you are looking to bring in rental income on a deadline.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Financing Your Townhouse Renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining financing for a townhouse purchase and renovation is essentially the same process as a condo purchase and renovation (co-ops are the outlier here). This is because a townhouse, like a condo, is real property. You can consult </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/financing-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Sweeten guide on financing home renovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are financing both the purchase of the property as well as the renovation, you have a few options (Jean advises consulting a professional to see what’s best for your situation).</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction loan and a permanent mortgage separately. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you will need to research two separate loans and pay for two sets of closing costs. Some lenders only provide construction loans, while others will only make combination loans. Construction loans typically run for 12 months or less and are subject to an adjustable interest rate that resets quarterly or sometimes monthly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply for a construction-to-permanent loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This combination instrument simplifies the process because you only need to take out one loan and pay closing costs once. It’s the more popular option for this reason. While construction is ongoing, you only pay interest on the outstanding balance, and then it is converted to a mortgage after the renovation is complete. You may, however, pay more for the permanent mortgage because the need for a combination has reduced your lender options.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Who You’ll Need On Your Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When searching for a townhouse to renovate, it’s important to gather the experts who will not only help you get the job done right, but who can help you assess whether it’s a project worth tackling in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, you’ll need to line up several professionals early on, including structural engineers, electricians, and plumbers. Chris suggests that you bring these pros in for site visits prior to signing the contract so that you don’t “end up buying a money pit.” He estimates that you could have all these consultations done for roughly $1,500 to $2,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to general contractors, Jean understands firsthand the importance of having a professional you can trust. “When I started to renovate my own Brooklyn brownstone, I ended up hiring the wrong general contractor,” she said. “If I can make a wrong choice, anyone can.” She started Sweeten to help homeowners find licensed and vetted contractors and to ultimately renovate fearlessly to create a home they love.</span></p>

<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150923230"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A townhouse is a common style of housing in cities and suburbs. Townhouses tend to be multi-floor units with private entrances. Townhouses share one or more walls with adjoining townhouse units; which differentiates them from single-family homes. Townhouse units may have small front or back yards, balcony spaces, or covered porches. </p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1639150942067"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse?</strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">A “condo” (short for condominium) is a style of housing usually located within a community of buildings owned by individuals. A “condo” community may have shared amenities like a gym, pool, garden, or adhere to rules set by an HOA. A townhouse is a style of home; generally multi-floor with shared walls with other townhouses. If a townhouse is located within a community of similar homes, it may qualify as a condominium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Our contractors helped reimagine homes in the New York county</h2>
<p>Westchester County offers residents the best of two worlds: the peace and quiet of the suburbs with easy and convenient access to New York City. So it’s no surprise that city dwellers turn to the bucolic region when they’re in need of more space and less noise. Not to mention, the area (which spans 450 square miles) offers an array of home styles, from Victorian and Tudor single-families to smaller Cape Cods and traditional Colonials. Ahead, we highlight a few Sweeten projects from across the county.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34775 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Nilda and Brian’s Tudor colonial home in Rochelle Heights was in perfect condition, with the exception of the dilapidated kitchen. They completely <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-250-square-foot-kitchen-finds-its-bliss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gutted the 250-square-foot space</a> and opened up a wall to install a backdoor to the patio. Design-wise, the couple kept it very classic and clean, with two-tone cabinetry and integrated appliances. Scroll down and listen to how the couple found their general contractor on Sweeten.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34250 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg" alt="bathroom vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Alissa-Kirk-Apt-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Mother-daughter duo Alissa and Tatiana took on the renovation of Tatiana’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-family-affair-turns-up-the-style-dial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom condo</a> in Hartsdale. The project—everything from the carpeting to the doors had to go—started one week after closing on the unit, with the goal of creating a bright and light home. Both the kitchen and bathroom were decked out with marble and white cabinetry for a serene look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32475 mb-0 size-full" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-golden-chairs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg" alt="white kitchen peninsula with golden chairs and blue kitchen cabinets with silver appliances after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-Tracey-McFarland-Kitchen01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Fourteen years, a trial project, and one bathroom renovation later, Tracey and Brian finally decided to take the plunge on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-stamp-of-approval-for-a-westchester-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating their kitchen and a powder room</a> in Pelham Manor. They kept all of their existing appliances but brought in all new cabinets, countertops, stenciled floor tiles, and backsplash tile. In the bath, the couple focused on space-saving solutions, including a pocket door and a compact sink.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33115 mb-0 size-full" title="long-bathroom-mirror-gray-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg" alt="long bathroom mirror on a gray wall in a bathroom with white counter and sink after renovation  " width="1000" height="1498" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Alexy-Scholl-Bathroom09-723x1083.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Any parent knows a shower-only household isn’t ideal for young children. So before moving into their new house in Pelham, Alexy and her husband decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-new-bath-and-tub-for-the-suburbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovate one of the bathrooms</a> first. In order to add a tub, an extended vanity, and a linen closet, their general contractor took square-footage from an adjacent hallway.</p>

<p>Soon after closing on their townhouse in Westchester County, these homeowners decided a kitchen remodel needed to happen as soon as possible. Many of the existing appliances no longer worked, and the dark brown cabinets, beige counters, and vinyl flooring didn’t help matters either. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/shaker-style-simplicity-in-a-pelham-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconfigured the layout</a> and installed traditional fixtures and appliances.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29717 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>While the location and bones of Brooke and Paul’s new Pelham home were perfect, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the kitchen was far from it</a>. They were accustomed to having a large, open space with an island for gathering. To bring the same look and feel to their new cook space, they took down the wall separating the dining room and kitchen, and added an eat-in island in its place. A custom L-shaped dining bench provided another space to enjoy family meals.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />

<p><strong>Sweeten’s Founder + CEO Answers Your Renovation Questions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Welcome to #15 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:JBrownhill@sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JBrownhill@sweeten.com</a> with any reno questions or dilemmas you’d like addressed.</em></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: Why should I move out during my renovation? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JEAN: </strong>The answer is, because you love yourself, and you want to stay healthy. There are so many airborne particles in the air during a renovation, from paint to sometimes, asbestos. We highly recommend that people <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">move out of the space when they&#8217;re gut renovating</a>, although it&#8217;s not necessary for every project or to move out for the entire time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If, for some reason, you can&#8217;t, whether it&#8217;s financial or otherwise, we suggest that you put some kind of vapor barrier between the space where you are living and where the renovation is happening. You want to make sure that you are healthy throughout your entire renovation. Think about it: while someone is demoing, they usually have a mask on and they also leave the property. You don&#8217;t want to be sleeping in a room filled with dust particles. We definitely suggest to at least move out of your space during the dusty demolition phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-35417"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-35417" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jean-Signature-1-723x387.jpg" alt="Jean-Signature (1)" width="723" height="387" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
