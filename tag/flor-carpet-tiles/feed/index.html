<p style="text-align: justify;">What was your bedroom like when you were 8 years old? It was probably pretty great &#8212; a place where your imagination could run wild, and that&#8217;s good enough for most 8-year-olds &#8212; but Jake&#8217;s new bedroom in Park Slope knocks most others right out of the water! Jake shared a room with his older brother until the family recently decided it was time the boys each had a space of their own. A small office in their home had the potential for a great 3rd bedroom, but because of its unusual floor plan &amp; limited area, Jake&#8217;s parents Ben &amp; Gail opted to hire a designer to maximize space &amp; functionality. The family brought in a Sweeten member who created an awesome new room where Jake can sleep, study, relax, play, and even host sleepovers.</p>

Elizabeth designed using Jake&#8217;s own favorite colors, combining custom furnishings with some retail purchases. The designer&#8217;s favorite additions are the <a href="https://www.flor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLOR</a> carpet tiles and a ladder that leads to <a href="https://www.whatisblik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this charming wall decal</a> (&#8211;and to another universe!). Paint colors are Benjamin Moore <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby fawn</a> on the walls and <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peacock blue</a> for the ceiling.</span></p>

The grey pouf seats &amp; bench-topper (previous photo) are custom designed, and the bench topper actually unfolds to double as a mattress for a sleepover guest.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_7661" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7661" class="wp-image-7661" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/05_theSweeten_MercerInteriors-boysBedroom.jpeg" alt="caption" width="723" height="942" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/05_theSweeten_MercerInteriors-boysBedroom.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/05_theSweeten_MercerInteriors-boysBedroom-230x300.jpeg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7661" class="wp-caption-text">And here&#8217;s where Jake sleeps! His murphy bed unit from <a href="https://www.resourcefurniture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resource Furniture</a> saves a ton of floor space and adds much-needed storage. The new bedroom is perfect for a growing 8-year-old &#8212; we hope Jake loves it as much as we do!</p></div>
<p>Many thanks to our friends at Mercer Interior and to Jake &amp; his family for sharing their renovation.</p>
