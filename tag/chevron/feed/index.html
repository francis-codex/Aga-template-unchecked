			<h2>From wide-plank to herringbone, these popular hardwood floor patterns spice up any home</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-15.jpg" alt="open floor plan with hardwood floors and large windows and sliding door to patio and contemporary dining lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51214" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovation by Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of using hardwood for flooring in homes dates back hundreds of years. Up to today, the material has proven to remain steadfast through time and trends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose geometric shapes like herringbone or chevron, or wide plank versus classic width, it anchors the whole home. Typically installed throughout, wood floors cover a large square footage. It has a substantial impact on your home&#8217;s personality and design style. No surprise, then, the perennial wood floor is often chosen for its unifying qualities and timelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, Sweeten renovators show how their hardwood floor ideas added to their home overall. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches residential renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering know-how, support, and up to $50,000 in renovation financial protection—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A herringbone wood floor in Crown Heights</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg" alt="Cafe style dining area next to the door leading to the roof deck" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43646" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-entryway-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s1">Janet and Jerry</span><span class="s2"> lived on Long Island but bought <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a multi-story fixer-upper in Brooklyn</a> as an investment property. Plus, it serves as a place to stay when they work late in the city. They updated the townhouse, keeping the small fourth floor as their own. For their one-bedroom unit, the goal was to create an open, airy studio. One of their pressing challenges was the hardwood floors. They were covered by old vinyl and carpeting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They chose white-oak flooring that would be custom laid in a herringbone pattern. Unfortunately, the lead time was two months just to get the wood custom cut. So, they adjusted their plans and found a pre-cut herringbone wood floor that could be installed quickly. Their quick fix became a beautiful solution.</span></p>
<h3>Herringbone pattern wood enriches a kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25566" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-48-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Nazli and Larry<a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/"><span class="s2">, updating their historic Brooklyn brownstone</span></a> was a labor of love. They wanted to merge modern and traditional styles. The challenge wa</span><span class="s1">s how to do so within the townhouse’s long and narrow dimensions. The couple also struggled between managing their budget and getting their absolute must-haves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, some things Nazli wouldn’t compromise on. One was the wood floors. They wanted to make a statement in the kitchen so they splurged on walnut and installed it as a herringbone pattern. It gives the kitchen a rich, finished look, which extends into the parlor. To stay within budget, they used a less expensive white oak for the upstairs—an area that sees much less traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pro tip: There are a variety of wood floor species—all at varying price points. Oak, maple, and cherry are popular choices as well as bamboo, walnut, ash, and mahogany. Shop around to find the one that fits your budget and style.  </span></p>
<h3>Wide-plank wood flooring</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47439" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Kitchen-Laundry-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these Sweeten renovators, redoing </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Greenwich Village condo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included gutting the place and adding a second bedroom. The plan was to maximize their 16-foot ceilings to make the 850-square-foot space larger and more modern. They turned it into a gallery-like space with black steel accents contrasting bright white walls. They kept the finishes simple giving an airiness to the space. One major design detail that achieves this is the contemporary-looking wide-plank wood flooring in a neutral stain. The home became more open, expansive, and refreshed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: By definition, a wide plank is wider than today’s standard 2½– to 4–inch boards. And they are believed by many to increase property value due to their current popularity and relatively expensive price.</span></p>
<h3>Wide plank flooring in white oak</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-04-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home was the reason for moving into their 1950s home in Los Angeles. Like a lot of people who found they needed a home office during the pandemic, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Kevin needed a larger space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the 1,538-square-foot house was perfect even if it was in need of a little TLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They hired a Sweeten contractor to fix up the living room, kitchen, and bathrooms. But first things first. They started by laying down new flooring throughout the house. “We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive,” says Amy. And a bonus: The lighter floors compliment the living room’s natural wood ceiling.</span></p>
<h3>Classic wood floors in a Westchester County compound</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg" alt="living room with hardwood floors large windows and fireplace and track lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51202" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/36758-Shana-House-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Sandberg of </span><a href="https://www.revelcraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revel Craft and Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to Sweeten to help </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-westchester-county-home-remodel-turns-into-a-top-notch-family-compound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovate her client’s home in Harrison, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The homeowners wanted to turn the 1953 estate into a convenient, multi-generational gathering spot for their family. The home needed an overhaul of the kitchen and bathrooms. The renovation plans also called for a new 750-square-foot addition to act as a large family room. The look of the home is contemporary classic brought together by the beautiful white-oak classic wood floors seen throughout. The homeowners chose variegated coloring to create a sense of refreshed modernity with a nod to the classic.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: Variegated wood coloring and mixed-width patterns add versatility and work well with both classic and contemporary designs.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tile revamps ho-hum walls and floors in an instant—from tile flooring to backsplash tile.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22453 mb-10 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg" alt="Geometric tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Jerry_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Geometric tile backsplash in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry and Janet&#8217;s Crown Heights kitchen</a><span class="img-label"> .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chances are, your home has tiles somewhere—the bathroom and kitchen, or maybe a foyer or mudroom. While they serve a practical purpose—waterproof, easy to clean, protects surfaces—tiles have now emerged as a pivotal element in taking a space from flat to fabulous! Look to tile as a style and even a fashion choice, as manufacturing advances such as high-definition (HD) printing and slip-resistant finishes help to create a personal statement on floors, as well as walls. Consider these five trends:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Faux effects</h3>
<p>Improvements in HD printing have translated to tile with highly realistic interpretations of natural materials like wood and stone, as well as concrete, plaster, and metal. And the options don’t stop there. In addition to the oak or walnut look, these woods are coupled with different finishes and treatments—pickled, distressed, reclaimed (with the faux paint still intact), sustainable alternatives to exotic hardwoods like a mirror-polished cherry or mahogany that you might previously have found only in a palace or a yacht. This tile also lets you take “wood” where you previously might not have&#8230;inside a shower, for instance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for stone, you can install a luxurious-looking faux marble for your entire bath at a tenth the cost of the real thing, and without the habitual upkeep, such as sealing. No need to worry about scratches or water or wine stains with glazed porcelain. Why not combine a faux-wood and a faux-stone look in a bath? Most tile comes 3/8-inch thick, so it’s easier to combine these looks in tile than to align the differing heights of real wood planks with marble slabs on a floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a more industrial look for, say, a loft or home office, check out faux concrete in a super-size, like 24” x 24”—again, without the need to seal and with no risk of cracking, like poured concrete. If you crave color but don’t want those glossy 4” x 4” squares you remember from the school washroom, look for porcelain tiles that mimic encaustic cement tiles, with their luscious hues and patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Add various textures</h3>
<p>As described above, faux effects are achieved from highly realistic HD printing. Textures are also now being incorporated during the manufacturing process. Some faux weathered wood porcelain tile includes the dings and saw marks you’d expect to find in reclaimed planks, minus the splinters!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick is making a comeback too, and with the introduction of faux brick tile comes a realistic pebbled surface. Consider paving your entryway with this tactile material—a perfect crossover from the outside in. Colored glazes in myriad choices give this brick fresh, contemporary appeal, and can provide a touch of texture to a space where a neutral color dominates like a shower or backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also expect to find tile with finishes that resemble fabric, from nubby linen to lace to fine twill. These styles look especially warm underfoot, and bring sophisticated depth when used on walls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Consider three-dimensional</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, 3D tile was very popular in those cool mid-century houses that were never renovated. If it was ever on your wishlist, you likely had to pay a lot for something that was hand cast or, alternatively, rough around the edges (literally). However, the demand for 3D has risen among designers for hotels and restaurants, and homeowners are now reaping the results. Manufacturers offer lots of interesting sculptural surfaces, from shallow recesses that resemble waves or indentations worn into stone by water to alternating raised and recessed hexagons to abstract and organic shapes that seem to spring from their surfaces. These tiles are good for feature walls and vertical areas, such as hallways that transition from one room to another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Beyond basic shapes and patterns</h3>
<p>The hexagon is one of the more popular shapes to appear in kitchens and baths; it combines graphic interest with a classic outline, providing a strong motif around which you can play with size and color. One manufacturer created a wall tile with alternating rising and recessed discs. The 3” x 6” subway tile is seeing a renaissance, and reinterpreted in a thinner and longer dimension like 2” x 10” or even 2” x 20”. The rectilinear shapes lend themselves to a lot of different patterns when installed, like herringbone, chevron, and the running bond as an alternative to the traditional stacked. If you’re in the market for something more sensual, consider an arabesque-shape tile. Smaller versions will work on the floor, where the grout lines prevent slipping; it also makes a pretty backsplash or wall behind a vanity in a master bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>Choose your size</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited a tile store lately, you’ve probably noticed tiles are getting, well, bigger. Rectangular shapes can be found twice as wide as you may be accustomed to, such as 12” x 24”. Squares, too, have doubled in size, from 12” x 12” to 24” x 24”. Besides their fashion-forward appearance, there are several additional benefits: these larger sizes or formats actually make a small space, such as a bath, appear larger. There’s also fewer grout lines, which means faster installation and easier upkeep. However, the size trend doesn’t stop there. Designers are mixing sizes to create interesting effects, and you can, too. Combine wide and narrow wood planks, for instance, to achieve a custom effect, or alternate four small squares with one large square in the same size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3>A word about grout</h3>
<p>A decade or so ago, most tile installations used a white or off-white grout. It was adequate to blend into the tile’s appearance and still show the pattern. Now you can choose from dozens of colors to match your selection. Contrasting grout, however, has caught on, particularly with subway and other rectangular formats, to get a more graphic effect or to emphasize the shape of the tile.</p>
