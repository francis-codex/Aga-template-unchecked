<h3>Lightening the mood</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I could have done a lot worse than this hand-me-down—a West Village apartment that my mom and dad purchased in 2016. My sister, Lindsay, lived in the studio for a couple of years until she moved in with her boyfriend in Brooklyn. I’d gotten my career in fundraising events off the ground, and I decided to leave my roommates in Murray Hill and move in.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg" alt="white family room with large picture window and white brick fireplace and tray ceiling with recessed lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The apartment is in a co-op building that was built in 1915. It’s small—approximately 320 square feet—and had accumulated some </span><span class="s5">questionable design touches from long ago</span><span class="s1">. Paneled walls, painted in a pretty but dark shade of teal, and distressed wood trim gave the place a downbeat vibe. It was so dark that I had at times referred to it as “The Dungeon.” Brightening the space was my priority.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing materials for resale in the future</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating the studio apartment</a> was a family project, planned with my </span><span class="s1">mom, Reneé, and my dad, John. This was our first renovation in New York City and we were nervous. We didn’t know where to find a contractor or what standard pricing would be. Where to start? To add to the challenge, we decided to keep the budget down by not hiring a designer. I would make most of the design decisions myself. We started by posting our project to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46932" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s best to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know the process and design plan</a> before you start a project. I wanted it to feel light, warm, cozy, and fun. It also felt important to create a home that would appeal to future buyers. As much as I love this place, it’s a studio—it likely won’t be my “forever home.” So I tried to pick materials that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the kitchen current and timeless</a> and the bathroom neutral. I created a document with inspiration photos and a materials list for each room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared it with our Manhattan contractor</a> as soon as we offered him the job.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful sourcing the products I wanted.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My family and I agreed we would tear out the ugly paneling in hopes of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the studio&#8217;s main living</a> and sleeping space; white walls and recessed lighting would brighten the space. Meanwhile, painting the window in charcoal frames the natural light coming in. </span><span class="s1">Next up was the kitchen, which had newish appliances, but needed most everything else, from repainting the cabinets to new floor tile, countertops, and backsplash. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the bathroom</a>, we would paint, replace wall and floor tiles, update the shower, and add a new vanity, mirror, and lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<h3>Discovering hidden arches</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We were excited when our general contractor got started at the beginning of March 2020. During demolition, we found the arched doorways inside the apartment. We’d had no idea about these beautiful, curved pass-throughs—they’d been covered up with drywall and paneling. It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s original charm still intact. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46937 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To modernize, we focused on lighting and thought about storage (a vanity with storage and a wall-mounted shoe rack)—vital aspects of the project in this tiny space. </span><span class="s1">I gave a lot of thought to creating a mix of open and closed storage. All the pretty stuff goes on the open shelving, and everything unsightly or rarely used has a spot to hide in.</span></p>
<h3>Renovating during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once we’d started working, the biggest challenge we had was dealing with COVID-19. A couple of weeks after our demolition phase, New York City shut down. Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules. As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46929" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up leaving Manhattan to quarantine at my family’s home, and as the situation worsened, most design choices had to be discussed over text, email, or FaceTime. Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcing the products</a> I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After a last-minute decision to change the floors, within a few hours, I found floor samples, ordered them for curbside pickup, chose, and ordered the boards so our contracting team could pick them up at an NYC location. Our contractor installed them the next day. It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="West Village bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46930" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The challenges of the pandemic pushed our timeline from two months to three, but we didn’t care—we wanted the work to be done safely. Our contractor was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diligent in our communication</a> emailing us progress photos every week and scheduling FaceTime walkthroughs. He notified our building’s management company and us if loud work was planned so that neighbors could be warned. This was especially important since everyone was working from home!</span></p>
<h3>Reno tips from the homeowner</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even in these lean and uncertain times, my advice is to add a buffer to the budget—there is always a surprise, or a little project, to add. I love the creative side, picking out materials, and deciding what worked best together. We certainly did not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs under our budget</a>. Not even close! We ended up spending about $70,000 on this project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the end, thanks to my family, luck, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding our Sweeten contractor</a>, I’m immensely happy! It’s so comforting to come home. I wanted to modernize the apartment, brighten it, and bring it into this decade—and that’s precisely what we did.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you for sharing your West Village co-op renovation with us, Taylor! We love how your 320-square-foot space turned out.</i></span></p>

<p>It’s hard to say anything but yes to the job next door. “This project, right around the corner from our home and office, was the most convenient project we’ve done,” said Keren Richter, principal designer and founder, with husband and partner Thomas Richter, of <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>. But that wasn’t the only <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspect of the condo</a>, part of a historic 19th-century building conversion in South Williamsburg, that drew them to the remodel. The lofted duplex, with its 19-foot ceilings and armspan-width, was unique in its shipping-tube configuration. And then there was the owner. Jared had stayed all over and sought to bring an alluring boutique-hotel vibe to the place.</p>
<p>“I’d been bouncing around between cities for a while—Amsterdam, San Francisco, back to New York City,” Jared said. “I wanted a place to call home, that would really be a sanctuary. I spoke with the design team about the aesthetics of spaces I loved, like SoHo Farmhouse, the Bowery Hotel, the Maritime in Chelsea, Brooklyn’s Wythe Hotel, the Freehold, the Clover Club, and the Walter.” The White Arrow duo was reeled in.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“We agreed we wanted to give the home the trappings of a sophisticated urban hotel,” Keren said. “It needed to be great for entertaining, hosting guests, relaxing and working,” which Jared, a digital agency founder, had been doing from home for years. The apartment, despite its high ceilings, was extremely narrow, with a ground-floor kitchen and living room that pushed the boundaries of its small footprint.</p>
<p>“Our goal was to make the home feel spacious and accentuate the positive,” Keren said. The walls, she explained, were a “disjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles,” including an inset stretch of exposed antique brick and a boxed-in, underutilized loft-bedroom platform. “We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display,” she added.</p>
<p>“Every square foot had to be well utilized,” Jared said. He wanted to add nooks and niches to put his things, and make the place truly feel like his own.</p>
<blockquote><p>We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display</p></blockquote>
<p>The designers and their client also agreed that, instead of demolishing the place, they would elevate the existing finishes and fixtures. “We set out to minimize the rustic details the developer had selected during the conversion, and bring the home to a quiet level of cohesiveness with a new color palette,” Keren said.</p>
<p>Following White Arrow’s plan, their Sweeten general contractor streamlined the place’s odd juts and angles, and adding custom integrated display shelving in the kitchen as well as the home office-niche. Workers refinished the white-oak flooring with a more neutral, beige color tone and painted the dark exposed brick. “I knew I wanted lighter floors for a more Scandinavian aesthetic, but was wary of bleaching them,” Jared recalls. He trusted the team and has no regrets. Similarly, whitewashing the brick felt risky when the designers suggested it—but it “totally opened the room,” Jared said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45654" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg" alt="painted green cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“Our client took some creative leaps,” Keren recalled. Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Keren remarked. Their Sweeten contractor retiled the kitchen backsplash with marble penny tile and changed all door hardware and plumbing fittings in the kitchen, as well as the two bathrooms, which got new grout and caulk, toilets, vanities, medicine cabinets, and fixtures.</p>
<p>Throughout the place, the contractors added new lighting locations and dimmer switches and swapped in new fixtures. “We added dramatic chandeliers and sconces that draw the eye up to take in the dramatic, high ceilings,” Keren said. “Living finishes” such as an unlacquered brass kitchen faucet, bring warmth and texture. A home-media specialist integrated a sound system and a wall-mounted TV.</p>
<p>It was with the furnishings that the designers really connected with the hotel aesthetic they strove for. “We chose distinctive, contemporary pieces in rich materials and jewel tones,” Keren said. Both Keren and Thomas were excited to shop and showcase an unusual mix of international designers, including Muller Van Severin, Gio Ponti, Atelier Areti, Harto, Maison Sarah Lavoine, Slash Objects, and Trnk. “We sought out furnishings that would do ‘double duty’ to maximize small spaces,” Keren said—sophisticated sofa beds, the secretary desk that Jared describes as “an ingenious space-saver.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Every piece,” Keren said, “is of the right proportion and scale,” including the king-size bed that Jared considered a must-have in the loft bedroom. The designers searched endlessly to find the furniture pieces that would allow every room to feel both luxurious and functional. To mellow the mood of the bedroom, Keren said, they added “a floor-to-ceiling, emerald-green velvet drapery to hide the formerly visible ensuite bath.”</p>
<p>The project had a fast turnaround, thanks to Sweeten’s vetting and follow-up during the project, Keren said. “The contractor was easy to work with and accommodating as the scope grew.”</p>
<p>As for the owner—Jared has been pleased to have his own digs to hunker down in during uncertain times. “The designs are super smart and well executed,” he says. “The living-room nook is discrete and conducive to relaxation. I am really happy.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Keren and Thomas of White Arrow, and Jared, for sharing the results of an inspired collaboration!</em></p>

<h3>TLC for a dark, windowless bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="homeowner portrait bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45065" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kristen-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom tub, fixtures, and drain in this circa 1964 co-op had done their job, but were now way past their sell-by date. Kristen knew her Chelsea apartment was ready for a bathroom renovation. “The shower and tub had gotten a little scary,” said Kristen, the homeowner of this 700-square-foot studio. Peeling paint on the tub and hard water stains on the tiles didn&#8217;t help. Plus, the windowless room was dark, with floor-to-ceiling slate tile and poor lighting. Lastly, there was no medicine cabinet or built-in storage.</p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30859 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom02.jpg" alt="porcelain shower &quot;after&quot; picture" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Kristen-Amato-Bathroom02-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A dark space brightens with white marble porcelain tile</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new plan for the bathroom would be bright and modern with classic elements and storage. Because of building regulations, she wasn’t able to change the location of the plumbing, so the work was cosmetic only. Flash forward to the finished room. The crisp, light walls and tub contrast with the black-and-white floor tile. A white marble porcelain tile shower with lighting reminiscent of Hollywood glamour brighten up the bathroom considerably.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I&#8217;m glad I chose porcelain over marble because it requires less upkeep,” said Kristen. She decided to pass on installing a vanity. Showing more floor gives the illusion of a larger space as does the linear pattern on the floor tile. A free-standing cabinet is part storage and part display. The overall look exhibits how small space bathrooms can carry strong design elements successfully.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<h3>Organizing material selections</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kristen’s biggest challenge was finding all the materials that would work together. It was difficult, she said, narrowing down selections, “considering the many options out there.” Her Sweeten contractor &#8220;provided a lot of information to help make decisions.” In addition to having a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/a-renovation-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovation Checklist</a>, Kristen had a list of products and materials to order for her project. “I checked off each item once I had sourced it. This was really helpful because there are some things I never would have thought of, like a new vent for the wall,” Kristen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having an organized list also allowed her contractor to make sure it was all compatible with the space. The contractor, she said, “helped incorporate eco-friendly elements into my renovation, telling me what to look for in a toilet, showerhead, and faucet.”</p>
<h3>Inspiration from unexpected places</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her other challenge was that she was traveling during the renovation. But her contractor took care of any bumps, even going directly to the manufacturer when there was an issue with a showerhead. At one point, she said, while she was at the airport waiting for a flight, the Sweeten contractor&#8217;s tile installer called with a layout question. “Luckily, this airport had a lot of tile,” she said with a laugh. “So I walked around and looked for different layouts to help reinforce my decision.” Who needs the internet when airport tile offers loftier inspiration?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Real reno ideas to help you maximize studio apartment space</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re downsizing or starting your first adventure in homeownership, buying a studio apartment is a big step. Plus, it typically means one thing: living in a small space. But if there’s one thing we know at Sweeten, it’s that living in a smaller space means you have to live smarter. See how these Sweeten renovators worked with their general contractor to maximize their studio apartment spaces. </span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29631 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg" alt="The smaller closet next to the bed area was converted into a built-in desk" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<strong>1.) Converted Closets</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studio apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> definitely needed work. A home office in the place of what could be a large closet was not ideal. Additionally, the kitchen clearly had more to offer than the undersized appliances provided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with her Sweeten general contractor, they made the space as efficient as possible. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skim coating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and restaining the floors made a big visual impact. Next, they converted the smaller closet next to the bed into a built-in desk. That let them transform the former office space into a large custom closet. In the kitchen, they decided to keep the existing cabinets as they left room for a full-size range.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37089 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg" alt="Swapping out sizable fixtures for smaller options helped this apartment owner maximize studio apartment space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-11-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<strong>2.) Smart-Sized Fixtures</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage is hard to come by, especially in older buildings and studio apartments. The lack of it across Christina’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">550-square-foot-studio </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the driving force behind her renovation decision. In the kitchen, a smaller sink, and ceiling-height cabinets accomplished the need for a more efficient space. A wall-length medicine cabinet and vanity solved the storage issues in the bathroom.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg" alt="Adding a kitchen island helped split up this studio apartment into distinct sections" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>3.) Splitting Up Your Space</h3>
<p>Kim and Ian bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">450-square-foot studio</a> that required a complete renovation (down to rewiring and replumbing). They planned to “split” the studio into two distinct areas. They wanted one area for cooking and dining and one for living and sleeping. The kitchen island became the main divider between the two spaces. Finally, their contractor made a surprising discovery behind a wall—two old, large windows. He removed them and used the remaining space for more storage and counter space, too.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24436 mb-48 size-full" title="studio apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg" alt="A walk in closet helps this homeowner maximize studio apartment space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Nancy_Apartment-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>4.) Adding Finishing Touches</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A benefit of many studio apartments: An </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/movie-set-comes-life-studio-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open floor plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nancy and her Sweeten contractor debated changing the footprint of her new studio, but ultimately decided to keep it as-is. Instead of changing the footprint, they made other changes. They widened the kitchen entrance, added French doors to an existing closet, and added a walk-in dressing room. Lastly, they used printed wallpaper to help define the bedroom as a separate space.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Manhattan home renovates with the right materials and storage</h2>
<p><em>Christina had wanted to remodel her circa 1959 studio co-op in Murray Hill for the five years she’d been living in it. The kitchen and the bathroom were dated, lacked storage space, and were poorly lit. Each year, she&#8217;d revisit the idea of remodeling—even meeting with contractors—but the timing never seemed right between personal and professional commitments (she&#8217;s a financial executive). Hearing so many renovation horror stories also made her hesitate. She discovered <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and took the big step forward. Christina <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27878">posted her project,</a> was matched <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractors</a> and made her selection. Here, she tells her story.</em></p>

<em>Guest post by Christina in Manhattan</em></p>
<p>Putting all my renovation fears aside, I felt my 550-square-foot studio space was not an accurate reflection of my style. The kitchen and bathroom were not well thought out, and the apartment really lacked adequate storage space. For the kitchen, I just used to ignore it by avoiding it altogether, but I couldn’t keep doing that. When I finally met the right contractor through the help of Sweeten, I felt the time had arrived to move forward with updating the space.</p>

<p>Even though it was the kitchen and bath renovations that drove me to get started, there were other things that needed updating. The walls were slightly bumpy in some areas, so I had them <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> [spreading a thin coat of joint compound or &#8220;mud&#8221; on the wall, and then scraping it away to leave a smooth layer] to make everything look as sleek as possible. Also as an artist, I have several of my oil paintings hanging throughout the apartment, so the walls were not all that noticeable, but <span style="color: #000000;">once you update one thing, the flaws in other areas really start to show.</span> Although not part of the original plan, the floors were changed. Upgrading the weak lighting was also a high priority.</p>
<p>My vision for the whole apartment was to look serene, timeless, and glamorous—without overdoing it. I wanted to keep things relatively neutral because my artwork adds pops of color; I didn’t want to create additional “noise.”</p>

<p>The small kitchen didn’t support the existing full-size appliances and was awkward to move around in. The refrigerator was too big and the kitchen lacked counter space, mostly due to a huge sink. That was the number one thing I wanted to correct. With little room to put anything (six inches of usable workspace), I ended up using a foldable table hung on the wall. I could not wait to remove that! The cabinets did not go up to the ceiling—another waste of a significant amount of space that could have been used for storage. The overall configuration became more efficient with a smaller sink and new ceiling-height cabinets. Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>In the bathroom, there was an old pedestal-style sink, leaving no storage space underneath. I have a ton of stuff and am also a neat freak, so I needed all the storage space I could get. I love mirrors that double as storage and insisted on having a larger medicine cabinet. This was a challenge because we had building pipes running behind where the cabinet would be fastened. We found a solution by combining two different-sized ones together; it looks amazing. In both the kitchen and bathroom, I paired Calacatta marble with wood-looking floor tiles for continuity. I knew that was the look I wanted even before shopping for materials. My contractor played an integral role in selecting the materials, offering a lot of ideas on what would look good and what might not work. He also helped <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customize the kitchen cabinets</a>.</p>
<p>I admit I have expensive taste, and sometimes I got carried away with wanting very high-end materials. My contractor helped me stay on track and we found a lot of reasonably priced options at Home Depot for things like light fixtures.</p>

<p>The original floors were damaged by water from a pipe bursting. I wanted a high contrast between the floors and walls and couldn’t believe what a huge difference it gave to the look and vibe of the apartment. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproof layer</a> was included per the building’s request. The entire removal and installation was surprisingly a relatively fast process.</p>
<p>I was most excited about redoing the kitchen; that was the area that bothered me the most. The thought of having everything finally the way I wanted it (within the constraints of the building requirements and existing structure) made me very happy. I was also really excited to be involved in every aspect of the project and learning about construction in Manhattan. After investing a lot of time and energy into the new finishes and design, I feel a greater sense of emotional ownership towards everything in my home. I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, but I can&#8217;t wait to leverage the new appliances and kitchen to their full potential.</p>
<p>The space is now an accurate reflection of my style and personality. It makes me feel at peace and happy to come home every day knowing every single thing is exactly how I wanted it. I feel a great sense of pride in the final product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Take notes from these Sweeten renovators, who expertly renovated their homes to get studio apartment storage</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a studio apartment, closet and storage space is scarce. Your only options for keeping everything in your home are being surrounded by your stuff 24/7 or adopting a minimalist lifestyle and ditching most of your belongings. Neither are perfect solutions. Instead, reimagine the closet, not as a single space where you keep everything, but as multiple spaces throughout your home. Take inspiration from five resourceful renovators who came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors—and see where things can go in a small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24842 size-chrono" title="bedroom built-in" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Michael_Millwork-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>A low cabinet wall can replace closet space for studios</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A low wall of cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/shoe-storage-renovation-87-pairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew&#8217;s bedroom</a> is the perfect storage alternative to the missing closet, providing ample clothing and shoe storage. Aligning the top of the built-in with the lower half of the window not only keeps it from making the room feel smaller but—<em>voilà!</em>—he now has a window seat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Kitchen cabinetry on a blank wall creates a pseudo pantry &amp; fridge space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Square footage was limited in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren’s tiny kitchen</a>, so she took a blank wall and loaded it up with storage for a hidden pantry and fridge—plus, a coat closet! Tucking everything out of sight provides an uncluttered and sophisticated look.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30499 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT22-1-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30500 size-chrono" title="clothing cabinet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Custom wall-hung cabinetry instead of a closet? Yes, please!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of closets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-studio-co-op-renovated-for-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Ian’s studio</a> meant that they had to get creative when it came to clothing storage. A custom walnut cabinet in the bedroom area with a mahogany finish takes advantage of empty wall space and adds some visual interest.</p>

<h3>Sleek storage in the living area expertly blends in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ying’s studio</a>, she took the average closet build and turned it inside out, adding cabinet storage, shelving, and drawers along the perimeter of the main living area.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26644 size-chrono" title="custom sliding wardrobe" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Miguel_Apartment-Before-01-02.gif" alt="studio storage" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>A sliding door that doubles as cleverly hidden clothing storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel’s bedroom</a> had a new entryway, but no closet space whatsoever, so he designed a custom sliding door that doubled as wardrobe storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A long-distance relationship blooms, from start to reno punch list</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kim and Ian were both far from home when a chance encounter in Spain brought them together. When the couple decided to close the distance between them—10,000 miles!—they found a studio apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. The previous tenant had lived in the home for nearly half a century, and during a walk-through, Kim and Ian discovered that the original plumbing and wiring were in need of an overhaul. Challenges aside, the space was just the right size for the two of them and full of good vibes—not to mention a fortuitous discovery in one of the walls. Ready to make it their home, the couple embraced a gut renovation of the entire apartment. Read on for Ian’s take on their remodeling journey.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30484 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Guest blog post by Upper West Side homeowner Ian</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story begins in northern Spain along the Camino de Santiago, where an aging Aussie trial lawyer met and fell in love with a not-so-aging American nurse who just happened to be working in Manhattan and living in Bayonne, New Jersey. Many cross-Pacific flights later, plans were made for a wedding in Hawaii and the purchase of an apartment somewhere on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where we could live together when I was able to escape court commitments in Sydney. With both of us having been married before with adult children, there was no need for a large apartment, but there was a definite need for the best use of a small space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_5482-e1517858044570.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30576 size-chrono" title="Kim and Ian" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_5482-e1517858032829-723x542.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Sweeten homeowners Kim and Ian<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30486 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Ian" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30496 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The search for an affordable apartment was challenging to say the least. But thanks to the StreetEasy website and FaceTime (for my wife in Bayonne and myself in Sydney), a studio apartment in a 1915 co-op was located and purchased. The 450-square-foot space was previously owned by a retired nun who had lived in it for some 45 years (long enough ago to remember John and Yoko walking down the street from the Dakota apartments). The old girl (the apartment!) required a total renovation but had a good vibe about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30517 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30521 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(During) Laying down pipe for the island<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 mt-24 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that I am from Sydney and my wife is from Bayonne, locating a suitable contractor was also challenging. After much Googling, I located the Sweeten website and was immediately fascinated by the Sweeten concept. So much so, that more out of interest than any real expectation, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted a quick job description</a> on the website and a hopeful (very hopeful!) budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With hindsight, I understated the renovation work required to a significant extent. While awaiting responses from Sweeten, I also contacted contractors I had identified from various magazines and other websites. Immediate ballpark quotes of $150k upwards from these folks sent shivers through my bones. Then interviews with potential contractors were arranged by Sweeten with the search ending in a coin toss between the two final contractors. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deciding on the Sweeten contractor</a>, who won out largely because he was both a qualified architect and builder, the renovating process began. The detailed quoted price was more than reasonable and way under $150k quoted by others.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30520 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Right) Hidden window discovered<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30519 mt-24 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30489 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suppose it&#8217;s axiomatic that the design stage of any renovation is not ideal when one of the players lives mainly overseas. But as luck would have it, a trial in Sydney collapsed and I was able to fly to New York for a thorough “walk through” with my wife Kim and our contractor after the building contract was signed. I had two absolute requirements—a new soaking <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solid oak flooring</a> throughout. Kim also had absolute requirements: a nice cooking area and island, and new everything else! After weeks of to-and-froing, preparing and amending the plans, work was ready to commence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s no exaggeration to say that what was required was, in effect, a gut renovation of the whole apartment. Laying new oak flooring was going to require the removal of two layers of old parquetry flooring. Hidden in the wall adjacent to the neighboring building (a contemporary high-rise) were two old large windows from a time when the building next door was an old brownstone. Our contractor’s eyes lit up at the sight, explaining how he could remove the windows and use the cavity space for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage cabinets</a> and counter space, both considered premiums in NYC studio apartments. I am a lover of wood, and the contractor proposed the cabinets and doors be made of American walnut and mahogany veneer. The final look and function of both pieces of furniture—a matching clothes cabinet hangs at the foot of the bed—are terrific and make excellent use of an otherwise wasted wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30494 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30493 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Plans for the main space involved splitting the studio into a cooking/dining/working area and a living/sleeping area. With the kitchen island as the primary divider, the plans were fine-tuned, including a design for a reconfigured bathroom. To be effective, a complete <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewiring</a> and re-plumbing of the whole apartment was required. This also involved breaking into the ceiling of the apartment below ours to put in new pipes and ball joints as required by the co-op management. Our Sweeten contractor did all the arranging with the downstairs apartment owner and diplomatically handled inevitable noise complaints. The guts were ripped out of the apartment and walls replaced.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The price quoted by the contractor to do the building work did not include the appliances, bath fixtures and other items such as tile, lighting, and flooring. We made use of various websites and sourced mainly high-end products, all of which when installed look fabulous and add value to the overall project. The sourcing and purchasing of items over the Internet was a real boon, seamlessly saving both shoe leather and thousands of dollars in cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Timing became an issue. Our contractor’s hope at the outset was for the project to be completed within three to four months. But with the unforeseen need for the gut renovation, including rewiring and re-plumbing, the project did blow out substantially in timing. Waiting for the soaking tub (Kaldewei) to come from Germany, the kitchen feature light (Vistosi) to come from Italy, and the kitchen faucet (Franke) to come from Switzerland also prolonged the completion date by months. Luckily, we both had other homes in which to live while the work took place. Now that the work’s done, the angst with the delay seems trivial.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally moved into the apartment in early December 2017 when I arrived from Sydney for an extended stay with Kim in New York. Living here has been terrific. And I’ve put the tub to good use throughout the very cold winter! The layout, feel, and livability of the apartment has exceeded my expectations. We’ve had some teething issues with bits and pieces (cracked tile, cabinetry needing adjusting, painting touch-ups) but our contractor has been most attentive to fixing any problem that has arisen. I must say though, as a Sydney-sider, the street noise in NYC coming into the apartment is a bit louder than I had expected. But as one of Kim’s friends said to me, “Soak it up mate, it’s all part of the New York experience.” Let the good times continue!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, Ying and her parents purchased an investment property on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It was a prewar studio apartment, perfect for a young professional right out of college. Ying made it her home for a couple of years and then moved on to another apartment in the East 60s that was better suited to her needs. The studio became a rental apartment for several years and cycled through three different tenants until it hit the rental limits under co-op rules. By this time, Ying had moved to Portland, Oregon, where she currently works in communications, but she and her parents still made frequent visits to New York City. They envisioned renovating the space to create a comfortable second home for themselves on those occasions.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors. Ying knew that she needed a contractor she could trust to manage the project since she wouldn’t be on site and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/19997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to Sweeten’s website. Her plans included new paint, lighting, and flooring, as well as comprehensive custom built-ins along several walls and a brand-new spa bathroom. This<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sweeten contractor</a> turned out to be the right one for the job, and he quickly got to work after discussing Ying’s vision with her over phone and email. She shared her <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a> board with him, and told him that her goals were to “streamline the entrance [by] knocking out that closet there, and leverage the blank wall as storage to make the studio look cleaner and give it more room.” Ying was inspired by the techniques used by designers of tiny houses, where “every corner is maximized.” The Sweeten contractor was in total agreement after seeing the space, and produced a proposal with the intention of achieving a look that was “fresh, clean, and simple.”</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, they reconfigured the space by the entrance to create a small dining nook. Ying chose a rift oak wood veneer for the custom cabinetry, paired off with brushed nickel handles with squared-off edges. There’s no longer any need for storage furniture, since the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> accommodate space for hanging clothes as well as shelving, and anything else one might need on a short trip to the city. On the floors, Ying went with a prefinished maple in a light stain. To contrast, the new lighting fixtures were matte black with modern lines, which tied in with the existing black window frames.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="hex-tiles-and-subway-wall-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49169 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="White bathroom with white subway tiles and contrasting gray grouting with slate colored hex tiles in shower and bathroom after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ying-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Ying’s favorite part of the renovation, the end result was one befitting a luxurious pied-à-terre. The tub was traded out for a walk-in shower with frameless <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-guide-to-glass-shower-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass walls and doors</a>, and outfitted with white subway tile and contrasting gray grout. A slate-colored hex tile was added to the floor of both the shower and the bathroom (in different sizes). A custom vanity was installed with a white Thassos marble countertop.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ying credits the great communication and management skills of her Sweeten contractor for getting the job done right. She has a self-professed obsession with attention to detail but knew that she would have to trust her team given that she was directing the project remotely. “They were really good at keeping me up to speed. They shared images of the ongoing renovation. We were in contact weekly. While the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-op took a LONG time</a> to get back to us on the paperwork, my contractor was instrumental in helping chase them down.” Ying adds, “I think that it helped from a design and reno perspective that I was never breathing down their necks. Pick a team you can trust to bring your aesthetic to life. And don’t feel worried about voicing your opinions—you are the client, after all! But be respectful; you are both working on the same project!”</p>

			<h2>Need WFH space? Add a nook desk to any kitchen or studio apartment, like these homeowners did</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg" alt="living room desk nook mid century" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-19-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost two years after the global shutdown, it seems likely the workplace will never look like it did before COVID-19. More companies and employees are exploring the hybrid model of work (part work-from-home, part in-the-office) or full remote on a permanent basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makeshift &#8220;lap offices&#8221; are upgrading to become permanent home features. And limited square footage is no longer a hindrance. The creativity of carving out a nook desk is growing. Whether a built-in nook desk or a desk area for a studio apartment, see how these Sweeten homeowners have reinvented their workspace.</span></p>

<h3>Built-in kitchen office nook for ultimate convenience</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura and Randy first saw their Upper East Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-op, they weren’t impressed. It felt cramped and not their style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with their contractor, they decided to open the space between the kitchen and dining room, adding a large island. A built-in desk niche would be accessible for when they worked from home. It would also serve as a homework station for their daughter, Mor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gan, as well. The result is a stylish and convenient small nook that holds court in the kitchen.</span></p>
<h3>A kitchen office nook with maximum organization</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Chris&#8217; 1950s co-op</a> left a lot to be desired.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was on the smaller side, so they got creative with the layout to ensure they could get all the “extras” they wanted. They worked a built-in desk and cabinet system into their plans. This allowed the couple to organize their work as well as have a neat and tidy place for the kids’ schoolwork and art supplies. Even with a full kitchen and bathroom renovation, the new kitchen office nook is still Chris’ favorite part of the home.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A former closet turns into a desk in a studio apartment</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27739 size-chrono" title="desk nook in Lauren's studio" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg" alt="home office" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-16.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>After relocating her clothing storage to a larger space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren&#8217;s Sweeten contractor</a> added a custom desk nook to the spot where her old closet stood. Three simple slabs<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>two deep shelves above and a desk surface<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>do the job.</p>
<h3>A modular desk in a living room adds functionality to a wall</h3>

The desk in the studio apartment, which provides storage for papers and books, is an ideal workspace in her small home since it’s down the hallway from her sleeping area.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/featured-slider/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbra and Sean lived in their apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a while before deciding what to renovate. Their kitchen would be completely updated. In the existing kitchen, there was a desk area already so it just felt natural to carve out a similar area specifically for this use. Luckily, they were able to find a new desk that fit the opening perfectly. They spruced it up even more with leftover wallpaper from their foyer refresh. Now, they have an inviting place to work.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Kasey set out to find a prewar apartment of his own and discovered original herringbone wood floors to take center stage</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26030 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who works for a real estate investment company, Kasey has an innate appreciation for New York City’s grand architectural history. So it was no surprise when he purchased a prewar apartment along Park Avenue within the Murray Hill Historic District, which boasts landmarks such as JP Morgan’s mansion and the Union League Club. “When I moved to New York, I was fascinated by the prewar architecture,” he said. “It makes New York real estate what it is.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26029 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26031 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-e1502742377528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26296 mb-0 size-chrono" title="foyer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_foyer-723x461.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During his search, he specifically set his sights on a prewar building with original oak herringbone floors. Even though the space he was considering appeared to be stripped of any ornate details, Kasey had seen other apartments in the building with the original patterned wood floors. He suspected—and hoped—that underneath the carpeting of what could potentially be his home, he might find the same wooden floors that he could <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinish</a> to their original condition. On his final inspection before closing, he lifted up a corner piece of the sad floor covering, and sure enough, herringbone wood floors in near perfect condition peered back. It remains one of his favorite aspects of the prewar apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That discovery was the beginning of a rather long process. Initially, Kasey planned to renovate in stages, starting with a kitchen makeover along with unveiling, sanding, and refinishing the floors. It quickly became clear that doing the whole apartment, including expanding a dressing closet into a small bedroom and renovating the bathroom, would best be accomplished all at once. The building’s co-op board, known for being strict, took six months to approve Kasey’s purchase. He anticipated that gaining their approval for the renovation would also take months and he only wanted to go through that process once. When he <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a>, his matchmaker helped find a contractor who had experience navigating co-op boards. From those he interviewed (including non-Sweeten contractors), he ultimately chose a Sweeten team because of their knowledge working with tough boards and their track record renovating similar prewar apartments. “They came with the experience of what is allowed in a prewar building and what isn’t,” he said. Other historic building details included cement walls throughout the home, which made demolition an involved process but ended up benefiting as sound insulation from neighboring units.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As the board waded through his renovation plans—it ended up taking four months to approve, the same amount of time as the entire renovation—Kasey rarely <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stayed</a> in the apartment. “It was in such bad shape,” he said. He opted for hotels and couches of generous friends. The studio was an estate sale and it looked like it. A boxy kitchen, cheap and tired cabinets, a grimy bathroom and carpeted floors throughout made for a dreary atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kasey’s aesthetic goal with the renovation was “to be mindful of the prewar nature and reflect the traditional design of the building and block.” For the clunky kitchen with a cramped layout, he basically started fresh. “I wanted to open it up and make it seem as large as possible,” he said. He got rid of the wall that separated kitchen and living room; not only did this merge the two spaces, it allowed the small window in the kitchen space to spill light into the living room. That is also why he envisioned a mostly-white kitchen—to reflect more light into the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26040 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26037 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Kasey_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="prewar apartment" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though Kasey doesn’t cook much, he specifically wanted a Bertazzoni range after noticing its distinct and refined design during a trip to Italy and felt it fit well with the understated classic style of his kitchen. The range threatened to delay the project when the wrong model was delivered, but Kasey&#8217;s Sweeten contractors quickly replaced it with the correct model. He also wanted a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen island</a> that ended up morphing into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. “It actually comes into the living room and overlaps with the wood floor to combine the two spaces,” he explained.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, he let his Sweeten contractor, a design/build firm, guide his design choice that would best suit a building from the 1940s like his. After sifting through 100-plus subway tiles that differed in color, gloss, and size, Kasey felt a white gloss subway tile was the classic way to go. Delicate hexagonal marble tiles on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and a light marble on the sink provide an understated detail. “There are no windows, so I was trying to use light shades of paint and reflective tiles to brighten it up as much as possible,” he said. Kasey’s Sweeten contractor encouraged him to keep the bathroom layout the same to avoid unnecessary permits from the Department of Buildings. He contemplated a walk-in glass shower but eventually went with a tub for resale purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were practical things to consider, such as storage lost when the dressing room turned into a small bedroom. While a door leading into a private elevator entrance was no longer in use, it helped provide space for a closet. It also remained a nice historical detail in the prewar apartment. Kasey also used furniture as a repository for more items—a living room coffee table doubles as storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Kasey loves his new renovation—the classic look, the bright space, and those herringbone wood floors—he has a new appreciation for the involved process of renovating in Manhattan. However, he learned one important lesson. “It is much more rewarding to live in an apartment that you spent a bunch of time renovating,” he said. “It feels a lot more like it’s yours.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b>It’s time to get creative with kitchen storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In most homes, the kitchen is in constant use. If yours is on the small side, keeping it organized is crucial to maintaining an enjoyable, efficient cook space. The key is to make sure that everything has a home and lives in a spot that is easily accessible. Since it’s not always possible to add extra square footage to your kitchen, you’ll have to get inventive with the space you do have. In order to inspire you to do just that, we’ve rounded up seven of the best kitchen storage solutions within Sweeten renovations that make use of every (and we mean every) nook and cranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24135 size-chrono" title="kitchen cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Emily_Kitchen-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-remodel-breaks-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily’s kitchen</a> in downtown Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use the height of your ceilings to extend your cabinets and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost kitchen storage</a>. The lower cabinets can be used for everyday items while those higher up can store items you reach for less frequently, like that fondue pot. You can even store non-kitchen stuff up there, like winter clothes or camping gear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22645 size-chrono" title="studio kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Giovanni_Kitchen_Bathroom-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/tired-kitchen-gets-jumpstart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giovanni’s kitchen</a> in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you live in a studio apartment, closet space is scarce. Rather than adding a washer or dryer to a closet, and thereby losing precious real estate, tuck one or two <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laundry units</a> under your kitchen <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula</a>. Now you can use some of that closet space for kitchen essentials—like pantry goods and servingware for special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26036 size-chrono" title="silver-appliances-small-white-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cybele-Kitchen-1.gif" alt="silver appliances in a small white kitchen with white cabinets and double hung window after renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a> <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/kitchen-goes-low-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cybele’s kitchen</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A corner usually means the end of the line for a row of cabinets—that is, unless you go custom. Take advantage of an awkward corner spot with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom-built cabinet</a>, maximizing every available inch.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26032 size-chrono" title="galley kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side kitchen</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are pros and cons to having more than one window in the kitchen. More windows mean more natural light, which is a definite plus, but it can also mean limiting the number of upper cabinets you can fit in the space. Adding custom shelves to your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhaust hood</a> is one smart way to make use of dead space. Another is building cabinets beneath the windows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-08-09.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-18502 size-chrono" title="kitchen drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SWEETEN_Samantha_Apartment-08-09.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="600" height="899" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron’s kitchen</a> on the Upper East Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like corner cabinets, custom drawers can take advantage of tight corners where cabinets or drawers placed side-by-side would ordinarily block one another when opened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Claudia-Kitchen.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26041 size-chrono" title="patterned-floor-small-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Claudia-Kitchen.gif" alt="patterned floor in a small kitchen with white kitchen cabinets and cooking range after renovation" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a style="text-align: justify;" href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claudia’s kitchen</a><span style="text-align: justify;"> on the Upper East Side</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a few inches of space between your range and your cabinets, or in this case, your fridge, maximize your kitchen storage with a pull-out rack. It can be a handy spot for storing cutting boards, trays, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spices</a>—you name it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20597 size-chrono" title="Pull-out cutting board" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-11-723x572.jpg" alt="kitchen storage" width="723" height="572" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar’s kitchen</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a small kitchen, your work space can be fairly limited. A pull-out cutting board among cabinetry or placed below the countertop moves prep off the counter, making more room for the many other tasks that take place while cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working with limited square footage, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliances</a> designed for small spaces will let you make the most of your kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh a 20-year-old studio kitchen with an updated feel</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In 1998, when Jill first purchased her co-op studio apartment in Yorkville on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper East Side, she made a few changes that she thought would improve the small kitchen design. In the 56-square-foot kitchen, she swapped a 20-inch stove (that had to be lit with a match!) for a 24-inch model and changed out the shelving for stock cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted storage capacity</a>. “I’m only 4’11” so I couldn’t reach most of the previous shelves,” Jill explained. It was perfectly adequate for nearly 20 years, but in 2016, she decided it was time for a refresh. The small kitchen had become outdated and Jill realized that she could customize it to better suit her lifestyle. She wanted to maintain some elements while changing others: the footprint would stay, as would the dimensions of the cabinetry. Almost everything else would receive a facelift—the floors, the countertops, the tile, all the appliances and fixtures, and the cabinetry itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Jill found Sweeten’s blog through Apartment Therapy’s <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/renovation-diary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovation Diary</a> series. She decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5175" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post her project</a> after a few failed attempts at finding a contractor on her own and was matched with a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>. Looking through other kitchen reno projects sparked a desire to add a custom pull-out <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spice rack</a>, but when her mother exclaimed: “How many spices do you even really have?” Jill reflected on this question (“…about 3 or 4?”) and concluded it would not be a good use of her limited space. Similarly, she had been advised by friends to choose a deep sink—something that seems to be universally desirable. But she realized, after using one in another apartment, that it wasn&#8217;t ideal for her shorter frame since she had to reach further in for the pots and dishes. Jill points out, “With renovations, you have to design for the reality of your life, rather than how you imagine it can be.” Jill took her own advice for the rest of the choices: clean, flat-front <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinetry</a> in Wickham Gray by Benjamin Moore, a classic subway tile in glass for a modern twist, and a dark quartz countertop that paired well with the gray, wood-grain porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor tile</a>. Pots and pans, as well as a knife rack, went on the wall opposite the cabinets. For appliances, she went with stainless steel models that were <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/appliances-for-small-space-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slightly smaller</a> than her originals. With the stove, she went back to a 20-inch model. “You wouldn’t think that four inches of counter space would make such a big difference, but it does!” Jill also removed a shelf above the stove and added a circulating exhaust <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/ventilate-kitchen-like-chef/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vent</a>. Forgoing a dishwasher was a no-brainer since she was happy to hand-wash and preferred the storage space instead. Lastly, for her refrigerator, she chose a stainless steel counter-depth model so that it wouldn’t jut out into the entrance to her kitchen. All the elements came together for a classic but understated look that Jill will be happy with for years to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Even though the footprint of the small kitchen design stayed the same, Jill gained a lot of extra storage with custom cabinets that made use of previously “dead” corners. She chose glass-front upper cabinets in the corner, which are fully accessible (with the help of a step stool), as well as bi-level Lazy Susan in the lower corner cabinet. Above her fridge, her Sweeten contractor added a custom shelf for her baking pans. And below the not-too-deep sink, the contractor installed a partition that is a perfect fit for her step stool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to our double issue to celebrate the long holiday weekend! Below, you will find posts that represent our greatest home renovation hits featuring some of our readers&#8217; most favorite kitchen, bathroom, and entire home renos on our blog and on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sweeten_home/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. Each homeowner came to Sweeten for help and after the project was complete took the time to share their renovation journeys with us—and you. We’re out scouting new projects next week, and will be back in full swing with the next newsletter the following week. Have a great 4th!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #d8bc3a;"><strong>SWEETEN KITCHEN: MOST READ POST ON THE BLOG</strong></span><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam and Sean’s transformation of an outdated, cookie-cutter kitchen in their Clinton Hill home got a lot of attention on our blog. Taking down a few walls opened up the space, making the room feel larger and brighter. Mix-and-match countertops create a customized look, pairing Caesarstone in Frosty Carrina with butcher block for the top of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank">peninsula</a>. Plus, graphite cabinets are a welcome departure from more neutral shades with bronze knobs for contrast. We also think our readers loved this post because Sam finished the renovation while pregnant with child number three!</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank">Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s kitchen</a> got 4,104 likes and 17 comments</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina, who happens to be an architect, drew up a new future for her kitchen; taking down walls, expanding <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank">storage</a>, and devising a color scheme that would really pop. New cabinets were painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore, a bold move that adds character and charm. For a striking contrast, the white subway tile backsplash and countertops—another appearance of Frosty Carrina quartz by Caesarstone—keep the space feeling bright and make it easy to understand why it was such a hit with our followers!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">SWEETEN BATHROOM: MOST READ POST ON THE BLOG</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24182 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Rima_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x1084.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/rimas-ikea-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rima’s renovation made her home feel like a different world altogether with a unique take on the modern bath that resonated with our readers. Needing serious updates, her bath received a new toilet, tub, sink, fixtures, vanity, tiles, and flooring. Porcelain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank">floor tile</a> with a faux-wood finish adds warmth and character while white subway tile lends a classic look. Rima wanted the bathroom to feel modern and have plenty of storage made possible by a two-drawer vanity, plus wall and medicine cabinets.</span></p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> got 4,783 likes and 25 comments</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben wanted a fresh and modern bath—like so many of our followers—so they planned on keeping it minimalist. A black hexagon floor tile with bright white grout adds a lot of visual interest while an inventive side-table-turned-vanity brings a touch of warmth and rustic charm. Plus, double medicine cabinets provide lots of sleek <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank">storage</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s impossibly charming studio is a marriage of modern and cozy and garnered the attention of our readers as well as </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Looking to create a clean, fresh, and calm feel, Lauren set out on a complete home renovation. The studio apartment especially needed help with storage since the larger closet had been converted into a small office by the previous tenant. Our favorite update: two closet makeovers that allowed Lauren to optimize her storage, making plenty of room for a serious shoe collection. Plus, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinished</a> wood floors got a darker shade that changed the tone of the room, adding richness and a level of sophistication.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine had all the floors <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white in her apartment, boosting the brightness of her space and drawing the attention of our followers. The white in the bedroom is balanced by exposed brick and wood tones, amping up the coziness factor. A slim corner sink and medicine cabinet in the bathroom, plus white subway tile, transform a once dark and cramped space into a relaxing retreat. In the living room, a collection plants placed in front of another brick wall inspired by Moroccan riads—a traditional house with an interior garden—create a soothing vibe. See the full makeover <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/fashion-designer-renovates-match-style/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>

</a>Guest post by Nancy in her Upper East Side studio apartment</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Nancy&#8217;s first New York City apartment was a long time in the making—35 years to be exact. She searched for a dream home in Manhattan where she could apply the movie set design playing in her mind, but none of the spaces felt right. So Nancy, who works in human resources, took matters into her own hands and purchased a 550-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s. Everything required an overhaul! To bring her vision to life, she made smart sacrifices in her narrow 6-foot-wide kitchen, turned a closet into a walk-in dressing room, and used wallpaper to carve out separate areas. You&#8217;ll want to read Nancy&#8217;s renovation journey.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;ve lived in the city my whole life and have spent the last 35 years mentally cataloging my favorite buildings, blocks, and parts of the city. When I decided to buy my first place a few years ago, I was living in Chelsea—and loved it—but knew I need to shift my search further uptown to get more for my budget. I had always gravitated towards the Upper East Side and gone to open houses on and off over the years. If there&#8217;s an elevator, doorman building without in-window air conditioning units (my only real deal-breaker) in the East 70s, I&#8217;ve probably been there at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The first apartment I saw on my search was in the same line I’m currently living in but on a lower floor. The apartment had been redone in a style that was fine but not my own, and the alcove was turned into a narrow bedroom cut off from heat and air conditioning. </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Fast forward a few months and I&#8217;d been turned off by so many similar “I could live with it, I guess” renovations that I was determined to buy a place that would require a lot of work, knowing I might need to sacrifice space for the ability to make my place my own. I had loved the location, building, and low maintenance costs of that first place I&#8217;d seen months ago and found a studio apartment on StreetEasy that hadn&#8217;t been touched since the &#8217;60s, except for some new appliances–score! An offer was made, and I set out to renovate before moving in. I was excited that EVERYTHING required a refresh. My apartment is a decent-sized alcove studio—about 550 square feet—in a postwar Upper East Side high-rise. Since moving in, I&#8217;ve welcomed a fluffy new roommate named Hudson, who enjoys spending his days on the couch. We&#8217;re still working on getting him to embrace his dog bed.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I had heard about Sweeten from a few places—</span><span class="s1"><i>New York </i></span><span class="s1">magazine, Curbed, and even from a colleague who knew the founder—so it was the first place I turned to when looking for a contractor. I met with a few matches and had a ton of questions. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*What would this cost (or rather, can I do all this with what I want to spend)? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How long would it take? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*How easy is it to get all my plans approved by my co-op board and the city? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">I&#8217;d been dreaming of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this project</a> since I first discovered HGTV and had a pretty clear vision of what I had in mind: </span><span class="s1">a light and airy space&#8230;a dreamy beach house vibe that a character in a Nancy Meyers movie was tragically forced to squeeze into a tiny New York studio apartment (the “It’s Complicated” kitchen will have to wait). </span><span class="s1"> That said, I knew I needed a lot of help executing that vision and managing all of the pieces of a renovation that don&#8217;t find their way onto a Pinterest board. My Sweeten contractor was great at figuring out the best way to rewire the space, upgrade the electric panel, add in a ceiling light in the living space, inject new life to the parquet floors, and bring the plumbing up to standard.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">My contractor and I spent a ton of time playing with the footprint. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Should we close off the alcove?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Turn the small linen closet into a new entrance for a dressing room/bathroom?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Open up the kitchen and wrap the cabinets into the living space? </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Expand both the closets into a small extra room and move the living space to the windows?  </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we decided to keep the footprint as-is, but widen the kitchen entrance that led into the living space, reconfigure the walk-in closet to be more user-friendly with french doors, and turn the cramped sleeping area closets into an open dressing room. I was always excited about the storage in the apartment, but now it&#8217;s much more efficient. Everything is put away in its own place and the storage blends into the look of the space.  </span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The other big question was the kitchen layout. I dragged my mom—fresh off two of her own major kitchen renovations—to IKEA on multiple occasions to work out a footprint that would achieve two things in the small space: provide as much drawer storage as possible and add a dishwasher. After one particularly insane mock-up where I had almost convinced myself I could turn the 6-foot-wide space into a galley kitchen with a dishwasher drawer stacked over an oven (must have been Swedish meatball-induced temporary insanity), we realized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> were the way to go. Surprisingly, Home Depot came through with their Innermost collection where each piece could be semi-customized to bring the cabinets to the ceiling and turn a corner into usable space. I love that I was able to fit a shallow utensil drawer below the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cooktop-101-basics-gas-electric-induction-cooktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">induction cooktop</a>. Choosing to forego the standard oven range was probably my most &#8216;controversial&#8217; decision—I really wanted that dishwasher—but I&#8217;ve come to love the induction top that fits into the countertop. The combo microwave/convection oven is perfect for my needs—it cooks just as well as most of the tiny apartment ovens and frees up a ton of space.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The rest of the decisions were mostly a balance between putting my stamp on the place and keeping resale in mind. I decided to go more traditional with the permanent kitchen and bath fixtures, but have more fun with the wallpaper, fabrics, lighting, and other decorative items. Using the Tanzania wallpaper print in the entryway helped define the space and kept with the black-and-white color palette. When I decided to keep the studio apartment as an open plan, I still wanted to keep the bedroom area defined as its own and the wallpaper from Flat Vernacular—which I’m in love with—does that well. It also keeps with the light feeling of the space. My contractor suggested molding with clean profiles—it&#8217;s actually just lumber—that works perfectly with the simple baseboards. I love the detail on the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doors</a> that have a simple style but give a bit of interest around the casing, which also helps relieve any warping with time. The floors were sanded down and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refinished</a> in a matte gray tone.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">The cramped, shallow bathtub was replaced with a large shower, making the space feel more open and so much more functional—perfect for containing Hudson’s bathtime messes. The deep <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage cabinet</a> above the toilet was one of the few things I&#8217;d probably do differently as it was a gaffe on my part. I ordered the cabinet without paying attention to how far out it would protrude—it&#8217;s 10-inches deep—and was installed with tile around it before I realized. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, but using a shallow medicine cabinet would have been a better choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">As with any reno, there were some hiccups along the way with permits taking a long time to come through and building regulations stopping work for any and all holidays. The 60-year-old pipes burst downstairs onto some very understanding neighbors, and then from above onto my freshly renovated space about a week after everything was done! </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Sweeten was a great partner along the way. Once I posted my project, they helped me figure out what I could do with my budget and asked the right questions so I could evaluate the bids I received. </span><span class="s1">They were a great sounding board when faced with questions during the process, such as delays and increased costs. I definitely recommend any renovator to use the Sweeten team to understand all the moving pieces throughout the process. Having lived in my space for some time now, I love it, and there isn&#8217;t much I would do differently. I am getting the bug to renovate and decorate a new space. So who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll be calling Sweeten again soon with a new space to refresh!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">From ranges and dishwashers to refrigerators, here are appliances that fit small-space kitchens like a (rubber) glove</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23398 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Manhattan kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02" width="723" height="485" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-723x485.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02-600x402.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-02.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span><span class="img-label"> (Above) A 24&#8243; Bertazzoni range in Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/pallavi-keyurs-manhattan-apartment-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manhattan renovation</a></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the size of their kitchen, most homeowners feel it could be larger. But what if your kitchen is </span><span class="s1"><i> really </i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small? Depending on the room’s dimensions—a narrow galley kitchen or even a trim 12- by 12-foot box shape—appliances in particular can seem to overwhelm a space and throw everything out of proportion. Thankfully, manufacturers have responded to this dilemma with smaller-size appliances that still offer the function you want while not overwhelming the space. What’s more, you may find the smaller kitchen, with most everything in arm’s reach, is actually more efficient and thus a happier, more productive place to cook. And with so many major manufacturers on this bandwagon, you don’t have to sacrifice style, either. P.S.: If you have a large kitchen, this is good news, too, providing the opportunity to fit an additional cook surface or fridge, or turn a walk-in pantry into an additional prep space. Read on:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Layout in a triangle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For any kitchen to work well, the layout must be planned for top efficiency. In a small cookspace, appliances in close proximity mean fewer steps and better conservation of movement and energy. Follow the classic kitchen triangle: place the functions of cooking, cooling and washing—stove, fridge, and sink—so that if you draw a line from each one to the other, you create a triangle. This means you will have allowed some landing space next to each of these features, and separation, too, to avoid a collision if two people share the kitchen. Once your floor plan is a go, you can choose the appliances that will do the job you want—and also fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cooking with mini power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have your heart set on a range, more than a few manufacturers will accommodate you with a compact 24-inch model that allows four burners and an oven, too, of course. <a href="https://www.bluestarcooking.com/cooking/ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueStar</a> makes a range in an industrial style that isn’t the size of an SVU but still packs loads of cooking power. If you’re comfortable with classic style, look for a vintage 21-inch O’Keefe and Merritt, a model created when small kitchens were the only way to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Need to go smaller still? You can find two-burner radiant and induction cooktops from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KitchenAid</a> or <a href="https://www.geappliances.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE</a> in widths starting at 15 inches. Then place the oven on the wall to free up more undercounter space for a slim dishwasher (more on this below). Also check out combo ovens that offer microwave as well as convection (one less appliance!), available from most manufacturers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t overlook range hoods; these come smaller, too, to top off their cooking cousins.</p>

<span class="img-label"> (Above) An undercounter refrigerator (left of the sink) and 24&#8243; range in Emily&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper West Side renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compact cooling </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refrigeration of smaller stature has come a long way since the top-mount model in your starter apartment. Manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/category/products/refrigeration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> make a model as slim as 30 inches, which can still stow a tray of appetizers. Need to go slimmer still? <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a>, LG, and GE each offer a stainless-steel bottom freezer refrigerator that measures 24 inches wide. If you don’t tend to stock a lot for daily meals, a refrigerator drawer (or two) is an alternative, and can be found from Thermador, <a href="https://www.monogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GE Monogram</a>, or Electrolux for as small as 24 inches wide by 34 ¼ inches high. Plus, the elimination of another swinging door helps reduce the feeling of clutter, easing traffic jams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undercounter fridges that still have a door are also available from companies such as KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Kenmore, and <a href="https://www.whirlpool.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whirlpool</a>. You can get a nice long run of counterspace if you keep all your appliances under the counter, which will make the overall space look less cluttered and hence feel larger.</span></p>
<p><strong>Washing in small batches</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The standard dishwasher comes 24 inches wide, and that will fit in most galley kitchens. But if you wish to go smaller, Frigidaire, Bosch, and Kenmore make models as narrow as 18 inches—just what you need to handle a day’s dishes. Or consider a dishwasher drawer like those from <a href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel</a>. Typically available at 24 inches wide, these versions can handle dishware for a party of six, but if that’s not how you dine every day, then it’s not a major issue anyway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 7 small apartment ideas are ideal inspiration for stylish storage and organization</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living in a city where space is limited can mean giving up square footage in favor of location. Small apartments can feel restrictive; there&#8217;s less room for stuff and fewer zones that can be dedicated to specific functions. When your square footage doesn’t allow for an office, dining room, or storage closet, it’s time to think outside the box. These clever small apartment ideas, brought to life from Sweeten renovations, prove that you can personalize your space to meet your needs in <em>any</em> size apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22053 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="white and black galley kitchen with yellow stools" width="1600" height="2401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Evelyn_Kitchen-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>This small kitchen loses a radiator and gets a window seat (plus storage!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/evelyns-sweetened-manhattan-co-op-homeowner-guest-post/">Evelyn’s</a> galley kitchen suffered from wasted space; there was a radiator beneath the window that was never used. She had it removed and replaced with a window seat with storage underneath, a suggestion given to her by her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228">Sweeten general contractor</a>. Now serving two purposes, the space provides additional storage and a dining nook that seats up to four.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22054 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="White and gray kitchen in studio apartment" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Frans_Apartment-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>A mini kitchen peninsula offers space for work and play</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/secret-storage-and-room-for-four-in-a-contemporary-studio/">Frans and Dalal’s</a> studio apartment, the kitchen offered very little workspace and barely any room for a table and chairs. By incorporating a mini peninsula into the new kitchen design, the couple was able to add extra prep space and a dining perch that’s perfect for the two of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22055 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg" alt="Prewar galley kitchen with counter and bar seating in living room" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen pass-through creates much-needed counter space</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A narrow galley kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily&#8217;s</a> studio apartment had virtually no counter space and nowhere to sit down for a meal. By extending the countertop through a newly created pass-through in the wall, Emily was able to define a spot for dining and enhance the social aspect of the kitchen by opening it up to the main living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22057 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="3744" height="5616" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01.jpg 3744w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3744px) 100vw, 3744px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A coziest office nook makes its entrance in a small entryway</strong></h3>
<p>Having put a new plan in motion for her kitchen, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/">Emily</a> set her sights on a pair of shallow closets that took up valuable floor space in the entryway to her apartment. She combined the closets and carved out an office nook complete with a desk, chair, and open shelving for books and office supplies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22058 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="Office and desk nook in closet" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-14-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Existing closet space in a studio swaps to become an office niche</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous owner of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio apartment had knocked out a large closet to create a workspace, replacing it with a tiny closet in the bedroom area. Lauren chose to swap the spaces during her renovation: the home office reverted back to clothing storage while the small closet—which turned out to be the ideal size for a workspace—became an office niche.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22060 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg" alt="Bed loft platform in studio apartment" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-15-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>A lofted bed platform adds clothing storage behind rich wooden tones</strong></h3>
<p>After successfully swapping the small closet for a larger one, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren</a> worked with her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315">Sweeten general contractor</a> to think of other ways to add storage and reduce clutter throughout her apartment. In need of a place to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for guests, her contractor rebuilt the existing bed loft platform, adding three bays of storage that were made easily accessible from the foot of the platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22059 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg" alt="Storage nook above closet in master bedroom" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_0075-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3>Make every inch count—especially if you have tall ceilings!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s no more room on the floor, the only way to go is up. To make the most of the 11-foot ceilings in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/west-village-co-op-renovation/">Elizabeth’s</a> apartment, her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818">Sweeten general contractor</a> suggested using the space to create more storage—an idea she couldn’t say no to. Rather than shoving things under the bed, this alcove is the perfect solution for tucking things out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amber and Chris made their space work for them by transforming their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/chris-ambers-bathroom-kids-room-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dining nook into a kid&#8217;s bedroom</a> complete with a transom window to allow ample sunlight to pass through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Closet and platform bed storage highlight an alcove studio</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we published Lauren&#8217;s studio renovation in October of 2016, we found ourselves obsessed with everything in it, from the thoughtful design to the clever storage sprinkled throughout. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones. <em>The New York Times</em> covered Lauren&#8217;s home shortly after, (see below) featuring her space in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/getting-organized-in-a-tiny-apartment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Organized in a Tiny Apartment</a>, an article focused on living small—yet smart—in the big city. Since many of you have set the goal of getting organized once and for all, we thought it was time for another look at this inspiring home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29653 size-chrono" title="Lauren's feature in The New York Times" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="723" height="781" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-723x781.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-278x300.jpg 278w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes-600x648.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Lauren-DeCaro-NYTimes.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>With a year left on her lease, timing was not an issue when Lauren closed on her new studio co-op in impossibly charming Brooklyn Heights. But with a desk where a master closet could be and a teeny closet where a chic workspace could be, Lauren needed some help to renovate before settling in. Read on for this first-time homeowner’s take on kitchen, bathroom, closet, and flooring updates throughout her lovely home.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Guest post by Lauren, Brooklyn Heights homeowner</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I started looking for an apartment last fall, I had no idea what to expect. I had narrowed my ideal location to Brooklyn Heights for its proximity to Manhattan and quaint feel. Once I saw the listing for this co-op apartment online, I knew it ticked all of my boxes and was ecstatic when my offer was accepted. I had time on my side as I still had about a year left on my current lease (did not think the buying process would happen as quickly as it did) and I decided the apartment could use some updates to fit my style and taste a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The space gets a lot of light and has a great view of the East River. I wanted to update the bathroom, darken the floors, and optimize storage space in the apartment. The way the previous owner had utilized storage space did not make sense to me; there was a large home office in a closet in the main living space and a small closet in the bed loft area. The bed loft also had a trap door for storage that was only accessible under the bed. I had no idea where to start looking for a contractor, but I remembered reading about an apartment renovation with Sweeten on <em>Apartment Therapy</em>. On a whim, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted my project</a>, and I waited to see what sort of responses I would get.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted the apartment to have a clean, fresh, modern, and calm feel with optimized storage to reduce clutter. I had most of my finishes and materials selected before starting the renovation, which made everything that much easier. I got two matches initially and then worked with Sweeten to line up more so I had more bids to compare. I met with four contractors and after much deliberation, I decided to go with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one I chose completely understood my vision and desired style for the apartment. I asked him at one of our first meetings if there was anything that I hadn’t included in the scope of the renovation that I should have, and he immediately mentioned <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> the walls and ceilings. The thought had never crossed my mind, but he pointed out the bowed beams on the ceiling and uneven surface on the walls. He educated me on why it was the best route to make this impactful update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the start, I knew that it would be difficult to darken the maple floors. Maple is a notoriously difficult wood to introduce stain, and I could tell from a preliminary search on Google just how hard it would be to accomplish. My contractor and his team did not back down from this challenge. They tried to go the normal route of staining first, and after the first round of testing and samples, we knew this would not give the desired result. They investigated different dyes and proper techniques for mixing the dyes and application. After some trial and error (and lots of labor), the floors turned out great!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To match my floors, my contractor re-built the bed loft platform out of the same maple flooring (as it was previously just plywood). He integrated a better storage solution under the bed loft, creating three bays to store off-season clothes and a folding table and chairs for extra guests. He also installed <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoe molding and base molding</a> throughout. In the bed loft area, after removing an existing closet, he created a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/home-office-desk-nooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in desk nook</a>.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29635 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-11-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, the existing stove was quite small at 24” and I really like to cook and wanted a standard size range. Replacing the range proved difficult as the existing cabinetry configuration did not allow for a range with 30” of width. With some creativity, my contractor came up with the solution by notching out the cabinets by a half inch on either side, shifting one cabinet down, and making it into a cookbook shelf at my request. This allowed me to get a full-size Samsung 30” gas range.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29637 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-12-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Replacing the range also meant replacing the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>. I knew I wanted to change the existing dark marble countertops for a light-colored quartz option. I discovered that Pental Quartz Thassos was the brightest white quartz to complement the white gloss Ikea cabinets that I was leaving in place. The same material was used to make new windowsills as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was also updated with a new sink, faucet, dishwasher, refrigerator, marble backsplash, and new under-cabinet lighting. My contractor came up with another great idea to add a soffit on top of the kitchen cabinets to finish off the look. The kitchen lighting was replaced, swapping out three pendants for one large lantern pendant.</p>

<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29643 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN_Lauren_Apartment-05-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, the fact that the bathtub was too short for its location really bugged me. There also was a very odd triangular corner which I thought was a terrible waste of space. Working with my contractor, I am so pleased with how the bathroom turned out. It feels like a mini spa. He squared off the triangular corner and broke through the wall to the exterior hallway, making the triangular corner into a linen closet that&#8217;s accessible right outside the bathroom. I added a drop-in tub that fits the space better and opened it up by replacing the shower curtain with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass shower panel</a>. The tinted shower tile gives the otherwise all-white bathroom a refreshing pop of color. New shower lighting highlights the unique color of the tile. The fixtures are from Kohler, as is the vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29646 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SWEETEN-Lauren-DeCaro-Closet.gif" alt="Brooklyn Heights studio" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My contractor came up with a great idea for closets and went with larger 8-foot closet doors to make the space feel more expansive and draw your eye up to the beams. We replaced all the doors with single panel doors and simple chrome hardware. Two closets were customized by California Closets while the contractor and his team built shelving in the other two closets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also built a cover for the AC/heat unit in the living room, with the front panel mimicking the same style as the bathroom sink vanity. And he even took the time to come back to the apartment to mount the TV properly when a handyman I’d hired had an issue mounting it into a steel stud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator, Sweeten made the process pretty painless. My contractor takes great pride in his work, and as a client, I could not be happier with my experience working with him. Yes, there were delays (as there always are), but he was incredibly communicative and was able to handle my nerves and constant questions. He and his team are perfectionists and true craftsmen, and I could not be more pleased with their work. Everyone who comes to see the apartment sees the quality of how the tile is laid in the bathroom to how the floors are re-done, and I owe it all to my Sweeten contractor.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In March, West Village homeowner Franz posted to theSweeten in need of a contractor to create a built-in shelving unit for his studio apartment. We connected Franz with tS member Gennadiy Kaliberda, owner of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Fork Projects</a>, who was able to do the job quickly &amp; cost-effectively &#8212; and just in time for the homeowner to leave for an extended stay abroad. While away, Franz is subletting the home to his friend Matt, who invited us to see how the project turned out. We love the new built-ins, which have made it easy for both the permanent &amp; temporary tenants to keep their belongings in the same, small space.</p>

He also caulked the edges to make the construction appear more seamless and native to the space.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8471 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg" alt="caption" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08_theSweeten_SouthForkProjects-FranzShelves-annotated-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The new shelves really complete this comfy studio (and it looks like they were well-prepped for last weekend&#8217;s Derby). Here&#8217;s to another job well done!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Franz &amp; Matt, and great work to South Fork Projects!</p>
