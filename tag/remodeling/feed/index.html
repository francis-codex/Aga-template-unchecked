<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48721 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg" alt="Image of a room in the middle of painting" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PandemicReno-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>When the global pandemic of 2020 hit, few homeowners were thinking about home remodeling. Yet as the pandemic wore on, life returned to (some) idea of normal and home remodeling once again became a topic. It was top of mind for homeowners who had already started a remodel before COVID-19 spread. Homeowners who had only considered remodeling also started to plan their projects in earnest.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to remodeling, COVID-19 has impacted material costs and changed the supply chain. Sweeten outlines what a homeowner might expect to encounter while taking on a remodel during COVID-19, and how to navigate those obstacles to get your renovation plans back on track.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re noticing our homes in new ways, every day</h3>
<p>Homeowners now spend more time than ever at home. Flaws that were merely annoying with that bathroom or kitchen are now magnified. Homeowners who only wondered if their home was ready for a remodel now know.</p>
<p>This need isn’t just imaginary, either. More people at home means that renovation is a necessity. Even if only a couple of people live there, everything in the house is being used more often.</p>
<h3>Savings from 2020 allow for renovations in 2021</h3>
<p>The pandemic has hit many people hard—the job market, businesses, people’s health. Some homeowners have been lucky, and employers have found ways to keep workers employed from home.</p>
<p>However, there is a rare upside to the COVID-19 pandemic for some Americans. Many homeowners’ expenses have shrunk dramatically. What has contributed to this? With less driving, gas and vehicle expenses drop. Less dining out and entertaining means lighter credit card bills. Vacation plans have been canceled.</p>
<p>This has caught many experts by surprise, too. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies had previously predicted a slowdown in home remodeling in 2021. But as 2020 wore on, the group revised its prediction. They now<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021"> indicate that home remodeling</a> is going stronger than ever, with a projected uptick in home renovation and repair spending from 2020 to 2021.</p>
<p>Indeed, at Sweeten, we saw an increase in home renovation projects. Our fourth quarter saw 110% growth year-over-year from 2019 to 2020. The trend is continuing into 2021 as well, with 99% growth for January 2021 vs. 2020. We attribute this growth to homeowners realizing their homes need to be so much more than a place to just sleep. More than ever, we&#8217;ve needed our homes to provide us space for work, play, self-care, and recovery.</p>
<h3>Act fast, or prepare to wait for building materials</h3>
<p>Homeowners intent on remodeling may find themselves blocked due to a severe slowdown in the supply of materials. In many sectors, the manufacturing of building materials drastically slowed or came to a complete stop. Even if manufacturers are functioning again, they are doing so at a reduced capacity due to social distancing.</p>
<p>The pandemic shows how much the U.S. depends on overseas building products like lumber, roofing, and windows. For one, many homes’ kitchen and bathroom remodels use ceramic and porcelain tile. However, over<a href="https://www.floorcoveringweekly.com/main/topnews/2019-us-ceramic-tile-market-update-29623"> 81% of U.S. tile</a> comes from China, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Brazil. Both Spain and Italy were hard hit particularly by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Home centers are ordering up to 300% more product due to the high level of DIY home repairs and remodels. This has a significant impact on the supply chain for builders.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait! For homeowners interested in renovating, it&#8217;s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up.</p>
<h3>Labor lag-time is a reality</h3>
<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, over<a href="https://www.agc.org/sites/default/files/Files/Communications/Recap_Current_Construction_Business_Conditions_Final.pdf"> 25% of building projects</a> came to an immediate halt or were delayed, according to an industry group. For any homeowner thinking of a remodel, this means that all other projects in the queue must come first.</p>
<p>Even materials that are acquired and on-site do no good unless there are workers to install them. Workers who have had to tend to family members affected by COVID-19 have left the workforce or even the U.S. At the same time, other workers who are eager to work have filled in the vacuum.</p>
<h3>Tips on handling your COVID-19 remodel project</h3>
<p>The future is unclear, but one thing is certain: COVID-19’s effects are long-lasting. Even after vaccines are widely dispensed, there will be an effect in building and remodeling. Here&#8217;s what proactive homeowners can do to position themselves well for a remodel during COVID-19 recovery.</p>
<h4>Book a contractor now</h4>
<p>The desire to remodel has increased, and in many markets, demand outstrips supply. If you delay speaking to a contractor, you’ll have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/16/what-you-can-do-now-plan-manage-home-renovation-once-conditions-are-right/?arc404=true"> even more orders</a> jump into the line ahead of you. With vaccines being widely distributed, there will only be more people booking a contractor. Begin setting up appointments to meet general contractors for site visits.</p>
<h4>Conduct virtual site-visits</h4>
<p>Sweeten offers a streaming video conference on the platform. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-renovate-safely-with-a-virtual-site-visit/">virtual site visit replaces</a> both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner.</p>
<p>If done effectively, it can give the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person.</p>
<p>Take note: a physical site visit will need to be done at some point for the contractor to take their own measurements and account for every detail. Virtual site visits are a good option, however, if an initial in-person site visit isn’t possible or safe.</p>
<h4>Expect higher costs, but shop smartly for savings</h4>
<p>Some<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/always-expect-home-remodeling-to-cost-50-percent-more-take-50-percent-longer-finance-expert.html"> experts predict</a> that home remodeling not only will take longer but will cost up to 50% more than in pre-pandemic times. Don&#8217;t worry: this gives motivated homeowners the chance to shop for items on their own. Make sure to seek the best possible prices out there, and select your contractor carefully.</p>
<h4>Make the most of your space with clever design</h4>
<p>Speaking early on to a general contractor or designer will help you solidify your ideas. Hone your design with care and avoid waste.</p>
<p>The transformation of under-utilized spaces is a trend here to stay. Basements, attics, or garages are performing in new ways. At Sweeten, we&#8217;re seeing attics turn into places for children to learn and play. Basements are mostly getting turned into gyms. Garages are becoming studios or offices that could be rented out in the future.</p>
<p>With multiple family members at home during the day, the installation of glass panels has gained traction. People aren’t looking for visual separation—they need acoustic separation when working from home.</p>
<p>Outdoor spaces and outdoor kitchens will be popular. It’s unknown if we’ll still be social distancing through the summer. Being able to host the whole event outside, not having to run back and forth inside, makes the event a better experience.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</strong></b>: Revamp an outdated kitchen in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Racquel scored a deal when she found her 800-square-foot co-op in an estate sale, though she knew the kitchen (that hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s) would need work. “The first thing I did when I put my offer in was ask people how to get the kitchen done. It looked like it belonged in a museum. I kept staring at the stove—I could not believe it,” she said. Her renovation journey, however, got off to a rocky start. After a year of work with a kitchen designer she found through an ad on Facebook, walkthroughs without results, a quick purchase of a too-big fridge, and poor communication overall, Racquel had enough and took a year off from the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once she felt ready to take it on again, a friend, who was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating her house</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> and had joined <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/referral/friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their referral program</a>, suggested Racquel give them a try. “My friend said, ‘I’ve already started with Sweeten and they’re great.’ I was done trying to find people on my own that I couldn&#8217;t properly vet. I needed people who knew the business,” Racquel explained. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project </a>with the goal of bringing the old-fashioned space to the 21st century while maintaining a feeling of playfulness and joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Once she was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377">this general contractor</a>, work began. Some debate about the stove ensued, but ultimately she decided to replace it. After living with it for over two years, “I had a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with my stove,” she said. While her initial thought was to incorporate quirky touches in the main elements of the kitchen, like using butcher block for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a>, she decided to stick with modern, easy-to-clean materials, and incorporate more of her personality through accessories and paint. The white glossy cabinets with simple matte black hardware achieved that sleek look while offering a neutral backdrop for a creamy yellow wall and colorful knick-knacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The elevator broke down, which caused some minor hiccups. The stove, which was set to be delivered, had to be delayed and was then lost. Despite the holdup, Racquel’s renovation was completed within the three-week time period the general contractor had quoted from the beginning. “He worked around the issues without batting an eyelash,” she said. He even joined her on a trip to IKEA, waited for the cabinets, and brought them to her home the next morning. “He told me every day what was going to happen that day, and that’s exactly what happened,” she continued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36155 mb-24 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-and-herringbone-backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with black handles and off-white countertop and yellow walls and herringbone backsplash and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-and-yellow-walls"  class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-36151" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with white countertop and yellow wall and undermount stainless steel sink with brushed nickel pull down faucet and herringbone backsplash after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/first-time-renovators-share-their-stories-vol-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-time renovator</a>, Racquel shared this advice: “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. Her patience certainly paid off. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The cabinets were still a little difficult for Racquel to reach, so the contractor also left a space for her ladder between the fridge and the wall, so she’d have easy access to it when she needed to reach higher shelves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The importance of curb appeal renovations? Homeowners can add value <em>and</em> make an impression, with basic landscaping to prepping the roof.</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33007 size-chrono" title="exterior-large-brown-white-house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg" alt="exterior of large brown and white house with sloping roof" width="723" height="406" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-723x406.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-300x168.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05-600x337.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Landscape/curb appeal project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who put their house on the market want it to be shown in the best light, and nowhere is this more important than with its exterior. Curb appeal provides the critical first impression to prospective buyers, creating the desire to step inside and see more—or to keep on driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage to strong curb appeal is that it makes for a pretty picture. Most house hunters start the process by looking at homes online and the first photo from the street can help draw buyers in and entice them to reach out to their realtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding to improve the home&#8217;s exterior at resale is really a balancing act. Perhaps the first question to ask is: why do anything? It&#8217;s a valid question in a hot seller&#8217;s market where houses go on sale on Monday and are in contract by the next weekend. But an improvement can also keep negative impressions out of a buyer&#8217;s mind. Few people are wowed by a nice roof, but everyone can notice missing shingles, discoloration, and other signs of disrepair. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, outlines the best areas for sellers to focus on for the best return on their budget.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Consider the home buyer&#8217;s POV</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Curb appeal involves many different elements, from a well-manicured lawn to an eye-popping entryway to a new roof or siding. Deciding which projects to tackle comes down to what needs to be renovated or at least improved—if something is worn or damaged, it should be replaced or fixed—and based on the budget, what the improvement can add to the resale value of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Check around the neighborhood to see what is most prevalent with other homes,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a>. &#8220;You want your home to fit in with the culture of the surrounding area. For example, you don&#8217;t want to install vinyl siding in a neighborhood with homes that are predominantly stucco or brick because people who are searching that particular neighborhood are looking for that specific look.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33009 size-chrono" title="brownstone" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Brownstone-Front-723x542.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscaping project by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten landscape designer Brook</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another obstacle is how homeowners perceive their home. Someone who has lived in the house happily for a number of years may not be aware of its flaws. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to get an opinion from someone else,&#8221; said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. &#8220;Some of my clients call me and say they are looking to sell their house and wonder what they should do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with a qualified general contractor not only gives you the benefit of their expertise, but they can refer you to tradespeople they have worked with and trust—a valuable resource when trying to find a good contractor.</p>
<h3><strong>Curb Appeal Renovations: Don&#8217;t overlook l</strong><strong>andscaping</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improving the look of the landscape may be the easiest and least expensive way to enhance curb appeal. &#8220;The landscaping and its health are very important as a well-manicured lot will naturally draw attention to the home. It contributes to the overall look and feel of the place,&#8221; said Majid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Start by making sure the lawn is neatly trimmed and the planting beds have a fresh layer of mulch. Add color and texture by placing seasonal plants in pots around the entry. Ringing trees with mulch will give a kempt look to the yard. While this may sound simple, such attention to detail or hiring a landscape designer to do the work provides your front yard the professional polish it needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33008 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-01-723x407.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="407" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Landscape project by Sweeten landscape designer Michelle</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is a fence, give it a fresh coat of paint, whether it is a picket fence in the suburbs or an ironwork fence in the city. Its square footage measurement will determine the cost, as well as what shape it is in. “More labor is required if the fence is in bad condition,” explained Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other more involved and expensive projects include adding a new front walkway or redoing the driveway, a key detail. Kyle said, &#8220;If the driveway is all beat up, the buyer is thinking, &#8216;I am going to have to replace it.'&#8221; The cost of renovating a walkway is also based on the square footage. This is the same for driveways except the cost is measured over the “blacktop, concrete and pavers. Another aspect that plays a part in the price is the elevation,” he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Remodeling and resale highlights</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both the <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Association of Realtors&#8217;</a> 2017 Remodeling Impact Report and <em><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remodeling</a></em>&#8216;s 2018 Cost vs. Value Report survey their audiences to estimate how common improvements affect resale value. Much of the data is based on the opinions of the professionals who were given descriptions of the project. The groups used different methodologies and the results do not perfectly align; however, the results extrapolated below could prove helpful for a homeowner making a renovation decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smaller-scale projects run the gamut from a fresh coat of paint on the front door to replacing the entry and garage doors. Larger improvements include repairing the roof to pass inspection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33103 size-chrono" title="Cost of Remodeling Projects for Curb Appeal vs Value Retained at Resale" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1000-Project-Graph-10a-723x815.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="815" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entry door replacements range from installing a steel door at a cost of about $1,400 to $1,700 to a fiberglass door that can cost as much as $9,000. A custom door for a 100-plus-year-old brownstone will be priced higher. In general, installing a steel door will recoup a higher percentage of the original cost, mainly due to the lower upfront cost. But the location also plays a role. In New York, a fiberglass door fetches 90 percent of the original cost, while the national average is 68 percent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, very few projects actually earn back more money than they cost but keep in mind the goal is to bring foot traffic and potential buyers to your door. The exception: garage doors. The National Association of Realtors ranked replacing a garage door third among its eight projects surveyed that earn back their full cost. (A new roof was #1, followed by new vinyl windows). The report also stated that 24 percent of the realtors surveyed suggested to sellers that they replace the garage door, but only 3 percent cited that factor closed the deal with a buyer. On the bright side, the improvement added more than the cost of the project to the value of the home in the New York area.</p>
<h4>Roofing, siding, windows</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roofing, siding, and windows are big-ticket undertakings that can cost $10,000 to $30,000 and projects that homeowners should consider carefully. Thirty-two percent of the realtors said that a new roof helped close a sale. &#8220;Roofing is important because the home inspector looks at it carefully,&#8221; said Kyle. The inspector will estimate the age and evaluate the condition of the shingles. New siding and windows helped close deals in the single digits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32965 size-chrono" title="house" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-CurbAppeal-2-723x482.jpg" alt="curb appeal" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4279" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Bud</a></p>
<h4><strong>Making a decision on your curb appeal renovations</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s the timetable? If you plan on moving in the future, then a major improvement may be ideal because you can enjoy it while you are still in the house. Then there is the budget and the many things to consider here: the cost of the project, what it adds to the value of the house, the seller&#8217;s equity in the house, and how long will you get to enjoy the improvement before you move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The last thing you want to do is have your home stick out like a sore thumb,&#8221; said Majid. &#8220;Overall, your safest bet as far as resale value is concerned is to stick with the general look of the neighborhood and neighboring homes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to achieve that “welcome factor” you need for a successful resale? Assess the condition of your home—whether its a series of small projects to larger-scale mends—and make a list. When you&#8217;re ready to start, use Sweeten to connect with expert general contractors (for free!) for your curb appeal renovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sweeten&#8217;s top 10 reno trends we predict will continue strong</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33607 mb-0 size-chrono" title="home design trends for 2018" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018-Trends-Graphic-1-723x723.jpg" alt="home design trends for 2018" width="723" height="723" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovators this year embraced trends new and old, from fresh takes to a more classic approach. Read on to see what made the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29449 size-chrono" title="white-barn-door-brick-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sliding-Doors.gif" alt="white barn door near brick wall and large window and brown floor tiles after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SLIDING DOORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A door can be more than just an entry from one room to another; it can take an open plan apartment and turn it into multiple, private spaces. Sliding doors add flexibility to spaces of all sizes, making rooms magically appear as if out of thin air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/custom-closets-apartment-surprise-gem/">Miguel</a> got rid of a wall of closets and relocated the storage to the bedroom, installing a wardrobe on rollers that could also function as a door; glass-paneled partitions allowed <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-condo-overhaul-begins-with-kitchen-sink/">Sarah and Craig</a> to create a second bedroom in their apartment without blocking the light from a wall of windows; to transition their office into a guest bedroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/general-contractors-dream-apartment/">Ana and Leo</a> opted for a set of white, sliding doors that have the appearance of a solid wall when closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29453 size-chrono" title="walls turned into peninsulas" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Walls-Turned-Peninsula.gif" alt="walls turned into peninsulas" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WALLS-TURNED-PENINSULA</h3>
<p>“Where there’s a wall, there’s a way” isn’t technically a saying, but it works well to describe how homeowners have been opening up their kitchens by chopping a wall in half. The move makes your kitchen feel much larger and boosts prep, storage, and dining space.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/">Lisa and Chris’</a> tiny kitchen, the close walls made it feel tight and restricted—until they turned one wall into a peninsula; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/">Kaija and John</a> did the same in their space and topped it with a poured concrete countertop; and so did <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/">Dan and Mike</a>, adding stylish wood paneling for a touch of contrast.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29469 size-chrono" title="gray-bedroom-blue-bedcover" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Multi-Comfort-2.gif" alt="gray bedroom with blue bedcover and gray fireplace after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>MULTI-COMFORT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Air quality/Soundproofing)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, the most comfortable elements of your home are the least noticeable, like air conditioning that keeps the summer heat at bay or soundproofing that elevates the coziness factor in bedrooms. When you’re thinking of new features to add to your home, like hardwood flooring or a marble countertop, don’t forget to make comfort a priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new HVAC system found a spot at the top of the renovation checklist in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> 130-year-old brownstone; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/deniz-ramons-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deniz and Ramon</a> added soundproofing to two walls in their kitchen to prevent noise from leaking into the bedroom; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah</a> chose solid core doors for the nursery so her girls can snooze away while she entertains right outside their door.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-29446 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wall-Hung-Toilet.gif" alt="Wall-Hung-Toilet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>WALL-HUNG TOILETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toilet may not be the prettiest feature, but no bathroom is complete without one. When it comes to selecting one for your space, wall-hung toilets have a lot going for them, from the nearly non-existent footprint to the ease of cleaning below and around the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/loft-gets-a-nordic-look-for-bathrooms-and-closets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix’s</a> Scandinavian-styled powder room, the wall-hung toilet blends in seamlessly with her minimal design; the unit in <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia and Ed’s</a> downstairs bathroom fades into the background so that the classic trough sink can take center stage; and in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-injects-personality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meredith and Jason’s</a> small master bath, the toilet takes up very little room, allowing them to gain back seven inches of floor space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29448 size-chrono" title="white-open-book-shelf-large-window" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skim-Coating.gif" alt="white open book shelf near large window and breakfast nook with white round table and brown wooden floor after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SKIM COATING</h3>
<p>Although the process costs more than a simple color change, skim coating greatly improves the appearance of walls. Think of it as stretching a fresh piece of canvas for your masterpiece instead of painting on top of an older artwork.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/">Cat and Jordan</a> took this extra step to reach the goal of making their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible”; the walls that weren’t demo&#8217;ed in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/apartment-party-four-five/">Sam and Sean’s</a> kitchen got a much-needed facelift; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/storage-swap-creates-more-space-alcove-studio/">Lauren’s</a> studio, she followed her contractor’s advice to skim coat the walls and ceiling to repair the uneven surface and hide bowed beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29454 size-chrono" title="patterned-hexagon-black-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Patterned-Floor-Tile.gif" alt="patterned hexagon black floor tiles and a gray vanity in a bthroom with white subway tiles after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PATTERNED FLOOR TILE</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom design doesn’t have to be boring; patterned floor tile brings color and interest, regardless of square footage. Go for the unexpected with contrasting grout, a pop of color, or a new twist on classic stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki and Chris</a> took inspiration from their favorite New York restaurant bathrooms with black hex tile and white grout; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin and Brian</a> chose a colorful blue mosaic tile; and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/blueprint-comes-life-family-duplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> took marble to another level with a graphic basketweave pattern.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29470 size-chrono" title="white-bathroom-beige-vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/His-and-Her-Bathrooms-2.gif" alt="white bathroom tiles in a large bathroom with beige floating vanity and white double sink after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>SEPARATE (OR SHARED) BATHROOMS FOR COUPLES</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you have two bathrooms or just one master, designing a stylish space to meet the needs of two people is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/">Leslie</a> combined two bathrooms in her home to create a large, luxurious space and installed an extra-wide mirror and double sink vanity; in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/computer-code-spa-bath-dream-home/">Cecilia and Jonathan&#8217;s</a> individual bathrooms, Cecilia wanted a bright, classic space, and incorporated plenty of marble, while Jonathan used stone to make his space resemble a spa; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/">Meg and Brett</a> went with a Kohler slop sink for two circa 1948 and a custom vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29460 size-chrono" title="blue-kitchen-cabinets-large-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blue-Kitchen-Cabinets.gif" alt="blue kitchen cabinets in a large kitchen with white subway tiled backsplash and a small kitchen island after renovation" width="723" height="483" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>BLUE KITCHEN CABINETS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping kitchens cool is as simple as adding the color blue. In Victorian times, it was believed that a touch of blue in the wall paint would help regulate the room’s temperature. Although the motivation has changed, this moody hue has made a triumphant return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina and Fletcher</a> redesigned their kitchen with navy cabinets painted in Newburyport Blue by Benjamin Moore; mixing white and blue cabinets add a layer of depth to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mollie&#8217;s</a> space; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/claire-mikes-park-slope-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire and Mike</a> selected Evening Dove by Benjamin Moore, a bold color choice, which helps define the kitchen from the living room.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29463 size-chrono" title="waterfall countertops" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Waterfall-Countertops.gif" alt="waterfall countertops" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>WATERFALL COUNTERTOPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing is more elegant in the kitchen than a waterfall counter. The look elevates an island from a purely functional piece into a sculptural feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/">Amy and Nick</a> splurged on Carrara marble for their kitchen showpiece; <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-retro-modern-update-for-a-brooklyn-duplex/">Alicia and Ed</a> refined the edge of their peninsula with a Caesarstone counter in Statuario Nuvo; Carrara marble made another appearance in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/">Lia and Chris&#8217;</a> space to cap the end of the U-shaped layout, a suggestion from their Sweeten contractor.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29471 size-chrono" title="large-white-paneled-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Paneled-Fridges-2.gif" alt="large white paneled cabinets for refrigerator after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>PANELED REFRIGERATORS</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t want your refrigerator to be the focal point of your kitchen? Disguise it with custom paneling and let the other features of your space shine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley and Simon&#8217;s</a> contractor proposed tucking their fridge into an existing column; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David</a> concealed their appliances among flat-front cabinets; to preserve the classic design of her prewar apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudia</a> chose custom paneling trimmed with molding.</p>
<p><em>Of course, we love ALL Sweeten renovations and are excited to help homeowners renovate fearlessly in the New Year!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Some of our favorite projects, big and small, in this booming neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the Barclays Center on the north end and the farmer’s market at the Grand Army Plaza on the south end, Brooklyn&#8217;s Prospect Heights has something for everyone. From its historic architecture to its tree-lined streets, and with close proximity to Manhattan, it’s no wonder so many Sweeten renovators call it home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joel and Eric already lived in the neighborhood (and loved it!), but ended up expanding their search for a larger apartment to include neighborhoods from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights and Brooklyn Heights. After a long search, they found what they were looking for&#8230;in the building next door. The one-bedroom, located in the heart of Prospect Heights, was brimming with potential. Its kitchen, with its dark cabinetry and metallic silver walls, was swapped for a more modern palette, including white, charcoal gray, and wood tone for added warmth. The pièce de résistance, a custom, wraparound counter that joins the kitchen to the living room, makes it easy to entertain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20293 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-new-kitchen-makes-way-for-two-new-arrivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The small galley kitchen in Sarah and Oleg’s one-bed, one-bath co-op had always bothered them. They knew they wanted to do something with it someday. Thinking of growing their family, “someday” became “right away,” and the couple turned to a full kitchen renovation that would also convert their dining area into a nursery. The space opened up, allowing the kitchen to become a U-shape, and bright white cabinets replaced the old, wood tone ones. And just in time for two new arrivals (twins!), the dining area was closed off as a separate bedroom with sliding doors. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28682 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1175" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-185x300.jpg 185w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-554x900.jpg 554w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marissa’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa’s one-bed, one-bath co-op hadn’t been touched since the early &#8217;80s, and it showed. Persistent leaks, dropped ceilings, and builder-grade fixtures made the space feel neglected and unloved. Drawing inspiration from her six-year-long career as an off-Broadway lighting designer, Marissa planned a dramatic makeover for the space. Black paint paired with white subway tile provides contrast while a petite, crystal-adorned chandelier adds a touch of glam. The finished space is smart, sophisticated, and wildly popular on Sweeten&#8217;s social media.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28684 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaija and John’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for a bigger home led Kaija and John to a one-bed, one-bath co-op in Prospect Heights. The priority was finding a sizable kitchen, one that could hold all of their appliances, including the ones that had been shipped and stored in Kaija’s parent’s basement in Minnesota. A gut renovation of their new kitchen was deemed necessary. The project centered on removing a half wall and creating a custom island with enough storage to stash an arsenal of kitchen gadgets. Inspired by the look of cement, the couple chose poured concrete for the island’s countertop. The addition of open shelves allowed them to put some of their larger appliances—like their attractive stand mixer—on display.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Nick’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners Amy and Nick wanted to buy in Brooklyn but didn’t want a space that needed a lot of work. That changed when they came across a two-bed, one-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that felt perfect for them. The first step was to free the kitchen from the triangular nook it was trapped in. Combining the kitchen and living room gave the kitchen plenty of room to grow. Aiming to create a space that would be ideal for both cooking and entertaining, a supersized kitchen island was installed and topped with Calacatta gold marble. Now the kitchen is the couple’s favorite spot to hang out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A licensed GC brings protection and accountability to your project</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47784 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Licensed-Contractor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You’ve spent months, even years, dreaming up your home renovation. You’ll want to hire a licensed*, experienced, and professional general contractor to execute the remodel. Make note that the term &#8220;licensed&#8221; can also be referred to as registered or certified.</p>
<p>*An important note: <em>Sweeten contractors are fully licensed in states that have licensing laws. Some states in the United States such as Texas does not license contractors.</em></p>
<p>Renovations can stretch budgets, making it tempting to go with a lower quote from someone who is unlicensed. However, in the long run, this can cost you more—in some cases, a LOT more—if anything goes wrong or the work isn’t up to par. Renovation matchmaker <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> vets all the contractors in its network, and checks in on the project until it’s completed. Cities, states, and towns have varying degrees of requirements for a licensed contractor, but chances are, if you&#8217;re hiring a licensed general contractor he or she will likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be required to have insurance</li>
<li>Be required to be bonded</li>
<li>Have gone through a criminal background check</li>
<li>Have taken and passed a contractors’ exam</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s why every home remodel should be done by a licensed building professional:</p>
<h3>When do you need to hire a licensed general contractor?</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Projects in New York City that require a license include basement conversions, demolitions, bathroom or kitchen remodels, and wall additions. <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/master-electricians.page"><span class="s2">Specialty skills</span></a> such as an electrician or plumber must have their own license that is specific to their trade even if they are operating as a subcontractor.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In California, a licensed general contractor is a must for any project above $500. Electrical and plumbing trades must also be licensed for jobs over $500 and are required to take a different exam from a general contractor (more on that below).</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Check your local building department</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The maximum value of a project that can be completed without a license varies from state to state and county to county. It is wise to check with your state and local building department for what project type and size calls for a licensed contractor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New York City, projects under $200 can be done by someone without a license. Jobs under $500 in California, such as painting can also be completed by someone without a license.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Whether you live in the suburbs or city in most areas of the country, it is very likely that all but the smallest home improvement projects, like swapping out a faucet or painting room, will require a licensed general contractor. </span><span class="s1">Anyone taking on a project over your area’s minimum without a contractor&#8217;s license is doing so illegally. Besides breaking the law, there is no accountability if an issue should arise (more about that below).</span></p>
<h3>You want a contractor who has insurance for your protection</h3>
<p>Your home insurance might cover a few things, but when something goes wrong with a renovation, an average policy won’t cover everything. For example, if a bathtub is installed incorrectly and causes water damage to your floor, your home insurance might cover the water damage. However, it won’t help you when it comes to fixing that shoddy installation job.</p>
<p>With people working in your home, you are something of a pseudo employer. If any workers are injured while on the job in your residence, you could be vulnerable to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Those reasons are why licensed general contractors are required to carry two types of insurance:</p>
<ul>
<li>General liability insurance: This covers the contractor against any third-party lawsuits involving injury to a person or damage to property. For instance, if your contractor reverses into your neighbor&#8217;s car, the cost of damage is covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your state, city, or county will dictate a minimum for general liability insurance. In New York City, it is $1 million. If you are remodeling an apartment, your co-op or condo board could request over and above the level required to get a licensed professional in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker’s compensation: This covers any medical costs associated with a workplace injury for anyone working in your home. It also covers lost wages due to a work-related injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do contractors need to have insurance in all states or counties? Although uncommon, <a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/general-contractor-license-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not every region</a> requires a general contractor to have all types of insurance. For example, <a href="https://generalcontractorlicenseguide.com/nebraska-contractors-license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nebraska</a> only requires GCs to carry worker’s compensation and not general liability insurance. Just to be safe, it is best to check what your state requires as well as the requirements in your local city or county.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A bonded contractor offers another safeguard</h3>
<p>Many jurisdictions require licensed contractors to contribute to bonding, which offers financial help to clients often when insurance doesn’t. Bonding is a pot of money that pays out clients if a general contractor fails to complete a job, doesn’t do the job properly, or damages a home due to negligence.</p>
<p>Bonding is required basically <a href="https://www.markupandprofit.com/articles/state-by-state-guide-to-general-contractor-bond-amounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everywhere</a>. If your state doesn’t require it, then your local area will. To get a license in New York City, contractors are required to pay $200 into a trust fund with the Department of Consumer Affairs or prove they have a surety bond through a third party. In California, a bond is always done through a third party licensed by the state.  Similar to insurance, the contractor pays a fraction of the bond amount required to a third party, who agrees to pay out the full bond amount if it is needed.</p>
<p>In other states, <a href="https://www.bryantsuretybonds.com/contractor-license-bond/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like Illinois</a>, there are different bond amounts for different types of work. For example, plumbing contractors must have a $20,000 bond, whereas roofing contractors only need $10,000. Again, as with California, the contractor pays a fraction of this amount to a third party. General contractors in<a href="https://www.suretybonds.org/contractor-license-bonds/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Florida </a>only need to be bonded if their FICO credit score is below 660.</p>
<h3>Most areas conduct a criminal background check</h3>
<p>Most areas will put applicants through a criminal background check. However, a criminal record won’t automatically disqualify someone from getting their license. It’s likely the licensing department will assess each applicant individually, weighing factors such as the severity of the crime, if it is related to an individual being able to carry out the functions of a contractor, and evidence that indicates rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Passing a contractor’s exam</h3>
<p>It is common to sit for an exam before a license is issued. How difficult that test is and what questions are asked can vary greatly from area to area. In New York City, 21 out of 30 questions must be answered correctly to pass the exam and be taken by a sole proprietor or general partner owning 10% or more of the company. The questions focus primarily on the knowledge of the city’s regulations and best practices. Examples are “Must a contractor furnish a consumer with a written estimate?” and “What are the penalties for false or fraudulent representation?”</p>
<p>California requires two tests. One is a more general law and business examination that all building professionals must take. In 2018, more than 51,000 exams were scheduled, according to California’s Contractors State License Board. The other is more specific to a contractor’s line of work: general engineering contractor, general building contractor, or specialty contractor. The second test takes more than three hours and contains technical questions such as “According to the California Residential Code, what is the minimum allowable width of a residential hallway?”</p>
<h3>How to check a general contractor’s license</h3>
<p>Always request and check for an HIC number. Many areas make this easily accessible and the information is often through a city or county’s consumer affairs department. For New York City, there is an online search tool where you can check whether a contractor’s license is legitimate and current (a license in the Big Apple lasts for <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/industry/general-contractor-registration.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three years</a>). <span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, where licenses are renewed every two years, there is</span> a similar <a href="https://www2.cslb.ca.gov/onlineservices/CheckLicenseII/checklicense.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online tool</a>.</p>
<p>The United States is a patchwork of state, city and county regulations with licensing requirements differing from place to place but the process your licensed contractor will likely have had to undergo will be similar. In some cases, such as with California, licensing is handled at the state level. In other states, such as New York, licensing is mostly handled by counties. But in some cities, like New York City, it is handled at a city level.</p>

</a><a href="https://dbryantarchie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D. Bryant Archie</a> is a textile designer and Brooklyn homeowner member of Sweeten community. D&#8217;s apartment, located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, is painted with rich deep color tones while her bathroom was a basic Decorator&#8217;s White. So she hired one of our members to paint the bathroom with vertical strips in Benjamin Moore China White and Onyx. Now her bathroom works to complete &amp; compliment the overall look and feel of the apartment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each week we visit a member of Sweeten network to check out what they are working on. This week we&#8217;re in Bed Stuy Brooklyn with <a href="https://sweeten.com/">South Fork Tile</a>. The owner (<a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>!) of this wood-frame house was looking to finish her kitchen by adding floor to ceiling subway tiles. She chose a medium grey grout and bright white tile to compliment the countertops and flooring. The project was completed in a day and a half by South Fork Tile owner Gennadiy Kaliberda. After years of practice and hundreds of kitchens this was a pretty easy project for him, so this left lots of time to hear about his tiling adventures across the country.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/01_South-Fork-Tile_Backsplash.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2275 mb-24" title="01_South Fork Tile_Backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/01_South-Fork-Tile_Backsplash.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/01_South-Fork-Tile_Backsplash.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/01_South-Fork-Tile_Backsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The box that the tiles came in was torn up and the pieces used as spacers.</p>

<p>I am not a tree-hugger. I like the idea of nature, but I like it best when witnessed from the confines of <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovely glass box</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;m studying for the <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEED</a> accreditation exam, which demonstrates leadership in the design and construction of buildings that promote energy-efficiency and resource conservation. The exam covers a lot of dry technical information, and I&#8217;m undertaking it mostly because the credential has become de rigeur for architects. But all this studying has gotten me thinking more seriously about the facts underlying the formulae. I&#8217;m becoming increasingly ecologically-sensitive about the way I live and the products I use.</p>
<p>So more than six months after I completed my kitchen and bathroom remodel I&#8217;m feeling a load of green remorse, disappointment that I wasn&#8217;t more environmentally responsible when selecting products and finishes. So many building products claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;green&#8221; now that it&#8217;s easy to dismiss as a trendy marketing tactic. But each shift in product manufacturing and purchasing, however small, contributes to a much larger shift in consumption that can help us protect our resources.</p>
<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ll do differently the next time I remodel:</p>
<p><b>1. Water-conserving fixtures</b></p>
<p>I although I wasn&#8217;t aware of it at the time, my showerhead and bathroom faucet are designed to minimize water flow. The reduced flow doesn&#8217;t really affect the way the use them, because they have aerators that bolster the reduced flow with additional pressure. My old toilet, which I reused, has a 3-gallon tank. (Think of what a gallon of milk looks like. Isn&#8217;t that a lot of water?) Next time I&#8217;ll install a new toilet with a 1.6 gallon tank or with a dual-flush system that uses a full flush was only when needed.</p>
<p><b>2. Energy-saving appliances</b></p>
<p>The refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave I chose all have Energy Star ratings, which means that they meet or exceed that organization&#8217;s standards. Next time I&#8217;m shopping for appliances I&#8217;d like to compare ratings more closely and try to maximize savings.</p>
<p><b>3. Cabinetry without urea formaldehyde</b></p>
<p>Lots of the plywood and fiberboards used in cabinetry are built with glues that contain urea formaldehyde, a damaging VOC (volatile organic compound) that leaks into the air and into our lungs. When looking for kitchen cabinets next time, I&#8217;ll to find out whether they contain this compound and, if so, what the alternates are.</p>
<p><b>4. Salvaged pieces</b></p>
<p>I bought all of my products brand new. My kitchen is so small that I might have been able to find good wood cabinetry, a good sink, and stone countertops at a consignment shop. Using reclaimed products saves resources and diverts waste from landfills. <a href="https://www.habitat.org/env/restores.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>, <a href="https://reclaimedhome.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reclaimed Home</a>, and <a href="https://unitedhousewrecking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Home Wrecking</a> are all good places to hunt for spectacular finds.</p>
<p><b>5. Tiles manufactured locally or with recycled content</b></p>
<p>I chose tiles for the kitchen and bathroom without regard for where or how they were made. Next time I&#8217;ll try to source tiles that are manufactured locally, or that have some recycled content. Buying locally helps to prevent emissions from shipping. And many manufacturers that sell at large retailers, like <a href="https://americanolean.com/leed.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Olean</a>, are beginning to incorporate recycled materials into new product lines.</p>
<p><b>6. Low-VOC paint</b></p>
<p>Interior acrylic house paint contains VOC&#8217;s in acceptable, regulated quantities. But several popular companies are manufacturing lines of paint with specially reduced VOC content, like Benjamin Moore EcoSpec.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficient light fixtures</b></p>
<p>A big chunk of the electricity used in our country, about 20%, goes to interior lighting. When selecting undercabinet and ceiling light fixtures I was more concerned with the light quality than with the light source. But different bulbs use very different amounts of electricity. A simple way to save power and money is to choose lights with efficient halogens or LED bulbs, or to use fluorescent bulbs in incandescent fixtures.</p>

<p>After living in New York City for fifteen years I&#8217;ve become a big fan of apartment living.  It&#8217;s sensible and ecologically sound.  We accumulate fewer things, leave a reduced footprint, and free up space around us for parks and plazas.</p>
<p>Yet my Dream Home has always been a wood frame house.  This might be a memory of my childhood house, a tidy split-level on a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.  And it might reflect my New England upbringing.  I love the simple, taut volumes of colonial homes, broken only by small windows and doors.  My Dream Home is a saltbox with a stubby brick chimney and a red door.  Sometimes I imagine my Dream Home beachside on a grassy field dotted wit hydrangea bushes, and sometimes I imagine it on a square lawn sheltered by maple trees and a low stone fence</p>
<p>It&#8217;s illegal to build a wood frame structure now in New York City. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/realestate/29cov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of nineteenth-century wood houses</a> were carefully maintained, have survived, and are grandfathered into the building code.  There are a few in my neighborhood and each time I pass one it conjures up the Dream Home.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1496 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/EAST-92ND-STREET-HOUSE-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>This house, on East 92nd Street, is at the end of a year-long restoration.  Just the other day it received a final coat of white paint.  For many years it had seemed a bit haunted, with shuttered first floor windows, peeling blue paint, and empty planters.  The rickety wood porch and shutters sagged badly and the whole structure looked as if it were ready to collapse, as if it were being propped up by the two large brick buildings to either side.  Its owners have done a great job fixing the facade, restoring the original wood trim and siding, and adding a low stone patio in front.  I can only wonder what work they&#8217;ve done inside.</p>
<p>As an architect one of the loveliest things to see is a wood house go up.  There&#8217;s something magical about the way the frame emerges from a haze of 2&#215;4&#8217;s, and something reassuring about the way men build it so simply and quickly with hammers and nails. Maybe technological advances will give us a way to construct a wood frame that&#8217;s less vulnerable to the elements, and we can fill empty spots all over the city with small wood houses again.</p>

<p>10 questions for contractor: Color Your Space<br />
Swee10 Profile: <a href="https://sweeten.com/">https://sweeten.com/</a></p>
<p>1. Your Name and your company’s name?  My name is Don Zuniga.  I have a small company called &#8220;Color Your Space.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. How long has the company been in business?  I&#8217;ve been doing business for over 12 years, but only 2 years as CYS.</p>
<p>3. How many people work at the company?  Its a small company.  I do most of the work, and have a part-time worker.  I also know other skilled craftsmen who I work with on larger projects.</p>
<p>4. What is the specialty?  I specialize in Interior Painting, but I also do faux finishes, molding, and wallpaper.</p>
<p>5. How did you personally get into contracting?  My dad is a contractor, so I grew up working and learning on his projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async"  class="mb-0" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4518474957_d6efc85ed3.jpg" alt="Color Your Space_three" width="550" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>6. Tell us about the job you’re most proud of in your career?  About 8 years ago, when I was first starting on my own in Boston, I restored a colonial brownstone in Jamaica Plains:  the floors, tile, molding, and walls.  It was amazing to see the difference, because it was in raw, worn-out shape, and when i finished, it was immaculate.  I actually got 4 or 5 referrals from that job alone, and did some work for designers who saw my work.</p>
<p>7. Do you have a web site? Has it helped you get business?  I do.  My website is <a href="https://www.coloryourspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.coloryourspace.com</a> .  It helps business because it gives people a sense of what I do, and lets then see some of my work.  I think having a website shows people that you are invested, and legitimate, and not just a guy who started painting or doing this kind of work yesterday because he needs a way to make money.</p>
<p>8. Tell us about you’re most nightmarish job?  I was doing a wall repair and painting job on West 81st street and Riverside Drive a few years back.  As I was working on a wall, the entire master bedroom wall began to crumble, because the plaster  was so moist from rain damage.  THE ENTIRE WALL.  I didn&#8217;t anticipate that.  You never know what&#8217;s going to happen when you start poking a damaged wall.</p>
<p>9. If you could change the construction process, how would you change it?   Its difficult to answer this, since each job is wholly different from another, so the process is always changing.</p>
<p>10. If you weren’t a contractor, what would you be?  A lawyer.  I have a law degree, but little desire to sit in a stuffy office with a suit on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here&#8217;s a space that needs some sweetening.</h3>
<p>This one bedroom prewar apartment is on Clinton Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The building is located brilliantly, on a lovely residential block close to the subway station, shops and restaurants.  The apartment is on the second floor and faces a quiet rear courtyard, with three large windows that let in lots of light.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1092 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="572" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has been unoccupied for many years and looks as if it hasn&#8217;t been remodeled in about forty years.  It has its original wood floors, crown and base moldings, and window trim, although they&#8217;re in poor condition.  The building has masonry walls and a hot water heating system with cast iron radiators.  The original wood windows have been replaced with insulated aluminum windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1093 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1094 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BEDROOM-01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The bathroom is roomy but has an awkward layout. The fixtures, wall tile, and floor tile all need to be replaced, and there&#8217;s a gaping hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1095 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BATH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>The apartment has no real kitchen, just a freestanding stove and sink near the entry.  The plastic laminate cabinets are in bad shape and there are no counters.  The refrigerator is currently in the living room.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/KITCHEN-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/LIVING-ROOM1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></a></p>
<p>It would be easy to look at this apartment and turn away.  The floors, walls and ceilings all need to be repaired and refinished.  It has no closets or built in cabinets.  The small side windows look out onto  light wells.</p>
<p>But a closer look at the plan reveals that it&#8217;s actually quite wide, 14 feet, which allows for some flexibility in the layout.  It would be possible to reconfigure the kitchen and bathroom so that they&#8217;re more accommodating and more functional.  The windows at the rear of the apartment are quite large.  They bring in a lot of light and overlook a quiet space.  The entire layout could be opened up to bring more light from the back windows into the center of the apartment.</p>
<p>This apartment is in a great location and has a generous footprint.  It would benefit a great deal from just a little bit of sweetening!</p>

<p>I know for those of you who have not worked with many contractors before, it&#8217;s hard to believe me when I tell you this. But a contractor who texts and emails is in fact a miracle. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s like walking on water, but it is something to appreciate. The vast majority of contractors that I have personally worked with while completing my home preferred to use fax machines or phone calls.</p>
<p><b>Why Fax Machines don&#8217;t work:</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked with some great contractors who had never even used a computer. But my life (and most of the people I know) does not include a fax machine, nor will it ever. And yes, I had people tell me it doesn&#8217;t matter since we can easily open e-faxes as attachments. I disagree. The very medium is out of touch with the way I think. A fax is a dead end document. I can&#8217;t mark it up quickly or revise it without going back to the creator of the document and asking for revisions. My life is more fluid and collaborative than that. It&#8217;s much easier to receive an email with a document I can edit if need be.</p>
<p><b>Why Phone Calls don&#8217;t work:</b></p>
<p>Usually when my phone rings,  it&#8217;s someone I know. It&#8217;s someone I want to talk to, and I assume they have something semi-important / important to say. With so many modes of communication, I can  twitter it, fb it, email it, or text it. But the  phone is still the most personal&#8211;it has maintained its place of hierarchy in the communication pyramid, with face-to-face being a distant first. The truth is, I don&#8217;t need to hear my contractor&#8217;s voice. It&#8217;s best to text me with issues that need an immediate response. I can get back to you with the answer and we have a record of the decision.</p>

<p>My old boss used to say that for every project an architect has three equally-important priorities: cost, quality and schedule.</p>
<p>As I began my remodel, maybe because of my background in design, quality seemed paramount.  Cost was the second concern. Because I had other places to stay during construction, time was the final consideration.</p>
<p>As I moved through the project, though, cost became the overriding concern.  Initially, flushed with optimism, I made payments for materials and services without a fuss.  But as the project moved forward and the total cost crept closer and closer to my limit, I became increasingly suspect about spending money and searched more passionately for less costly substitutions.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the smaller, more ornamental elements.  I spent a little extra money to get a faucet set for my bathroom sink from a high end supplier.  But I didn&#8217;t order the supplier&#8217;s matching toilet paper holder and towel bars because I couldn&#8217;t justify the extra expense for such simple pieces of hardware.  I returned a beautiful towel shelf I had ordered because, when the time came to install it, it felt too opulent.  Instead of ordering kitchen cabinet pulls from the supplier I bought them in bulk at a hardware store.</p>
<p>I was especially alarmed by surprise costs, which came fast and furious at the end of the project.  My building management company mailed me an invoice for the cost of their &#8220;Architectural Review,&#8221; which they had not told me about.  I had to order extra wood panels from the cabinet supplier to complete the installation.  And I needed a myriad of small, last-minute items from the hardware store like a shower curtain rod and a lever for my toilet tank.  Each time I pulled out my credit card I winced.</p>
<p>As in many other things, what helped most was to step back and take a larger view. The remodel was an investment that would ultimately increase the value of my home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-759" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG" alt="Tiling" width="540" height="668" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILING-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Architects tend to be perfectionists and also indecisive, which is a dangerous combination.  In the architecture offices where I worked I spent hours locked in conference rooms with colleagues agonizing about the height of a baseboard, the profile of a window mullion, and the location of a light switch.</p>
<p>These are details that aren&#8217;t important to a client and don&#8217;t often affect the overall impact of a project.  But architects agonize over things like this; it&#8217;s part of what they do.  For my kitchen remodel I spent hours deciding between different cherry wood stains, different shades of white paint, and different cabinet door knobs.</p>
<p>In the end details that I thought were highly important were not carried out.  For my bathroom I thought it was crucial to reproduce the tiny 1/32&#8243; tile grout joints from the original walls.  A typical ceramic wall tile grout joint is 1/8&#8243; but I felt that this size joint was simply too wide, too crude, and that it would detract from the beauty of the tile.  I even had a bad dream about it.  In this dream I returned to my bathroom after a week-long holiday and found my shower walls finished with 1/2&#8243; tile joints.  I awoke with a start!</p>
<p>In the end, almost as a comeuppance, my bathroom was completed with 1/8&#8243; grout joints.  This was entirely my own fault.  The tiler began his work very early one morning, before I or the site supervisor could speak to him.  I&#8217;ll never forget walking onto site that day and seeing all the tile laid out on my bathroom walls, absolutely beautifully, and set apart with 1/8&#8243; spacers.  The mason was beaming.  He turned to me and said, &#8220;Look at how much I&#8217;ve completed already.&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t ask him to redo the work; he&#8217;d done exactly what was expected.  So instead I took a very deep breath.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg" alt="Tile Comparison" width="540" height="156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/TILE-COMPARISON-300x87.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>In the end the bathroom walls turned out beautifully.  The cream-colored grout that we had selected in order to miminize staining brought out a golden hue in the glaze of the tile.  The original 1/32&#8243; joints that I had wanted had created a colder, more clinical surface.  The 1/8&#8243; joints, which I had abhorred, gave the entire room a warmer, more welcoming feeling.</p>

<p>Overwhelmingly, contractors answer &#8220;no&#8221; to the above question ( only 27% of contractors currently have a functional web site, from this <a href="https://amzn.com/0226472698">book </a>). We know they have <a href="/2009/12/02/van-of-the-week-8/">vans</a>, <a href="/2009/10/20/van-of-the-week-5/">vans</a> and <a href="/2009/10/12/contractor-signaling/">more vans</a>. But how useful can just a van be as an advertising tool. It can tell the viewer the specific skill set of the company, some basic contact information and that they are willing to travel to the area where the van currently is. But it&#8217;s really hard to get any meaningful data from just a van.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s why we have created super simple websites for contractors on our site. Each website comes with:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Custom dedicated urls<br />
Contractors can choose their own url, it can be whatever is best for your business, the name of the company, the name of the person, the person&#8217;s name and his specialty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Project Gallery<br />
Contractors and selected homeowners/ clients who have worked with that contractor, can post before and after images and descriptions of past projects or new projects managed on the swee10 site.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Relevant Rating System<br />
Good, Fast or Cheap. Pick two. We know in the real world how many hammers, stars or A’s you get doesn’t mean anything. What matters is that you are correctly matched for the requirements of the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are completely <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/signup">FREE</a> to set up.</p>

<p>Whenever someone tells me they&#8217;re starting a home remodeling project I tell them the three things that I&#8217;ve learned in my fifteen years working as an architect.  1.  It will cost more than you expect.  2.  It will take longer than you expect.  3.  It will turn out better than you expect.</p>
<p>Yet when it came to my own remodel didn&#8217;t want to accept that second bit of wisdom.  Each of the contractors I interviewed told me that my remodel would take three weeks, and I believed it.  In the end it took seven full weeks to complete the construction work.  This is through no fault of the contractor&#8217;s.  There were some surprises during demolition and construction that required extra time to handle.</p>
<p>I was lucky because a number of friends invited me stay at their places while work was being done.  And my parents live just an hour  outside of New York.  I knew that I could stay with them for as long as required and commute into the city each day to monitor construction.  At first this &#8220;homelessness&#8221; was sort of fun, like a series of small vacations.  I got to explore different neighborhoods in the city: the Upper West Side, the Lower East Side, Union Square and Park Slope.  I spent quality time with friends and a lovely, relaxing week with my parents.</p>
<p>But after two weeks the novelty of being a vagabond wore off.  Before beginning demolition the contractors had sealed off my clothes closet with blue tape to prevent dust infiltration, so I was limited to the clothes I had packed in my suitcase.  And I had packed very badly, throwing together casual summer clothes in a rolling suitcase.  Then the weather turned and I was invited to some more formal parties and I found it impossible to dress properly.  I wore paint-splattered jeans to  a chi-chi fashion industry event, and flip-flops to a dinner date.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a creature of habit; a disciplined environment helps me to remain focused and productive.  This apartment remodel disrupted every aspect of my life, it shook up my routines of sleeping, bathing, dressing, eating and socializing.  The resulting sense of displacement, both physical and emotional, was unnerving and entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>Mid-way through the project, after demolition was complete and before finishes and fixtures had been installed, was the most difficult time.  At that moment it felt as things would never return to normal,  that I would be rolling around that suitcase forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-753" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG.JPG" alt="Living Room: Mid-construction" width="540" height="644" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG.JPG 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/FOG-252x300.jpg 252w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>I visited Kuwait, briefly, in 2006 and the entire place felt as if it were immersed in a dust storm.   I couldn&#8217;t see clearly more than ten feet in any direction because of sand motes suspended in the air.  On top of this there was a sharp, dry smell, as if from distant fires.  I sensed that the place had seen terrible destruction.  My home feels a little like that right now.</p>
<p>As I write this I&#8217;m sitting at a dust-coated desk, in my dust-filled bedroom, brushing dust off my keyboard, and breathing  dust into my lungs.  I&#8217;m perpetually brushing my clothes and rinsing my hands, unable to feel that they&#8217;re clean.</p>
<p>Contrary to what I expected, demolition was not the dirtiest stage of the remodel.  Demolition produced debris that could be piled up, bagged, and left at the curb.  It&#8217;s the final woodwork, plasterwork, and sanding that has been more difficult to control.  They release a fine dust that clings to every surface and makes it difficult to see from one end of a room the other.  Just as my remodel is reaching completion, I&#8217;m enveloped in a blinding construction fog.</p>
<p>The construction workers have been careful about keeping my furniture covered, sealing off my closets with blue tape, and cleaning the site periodically.  But there might not be no escape from this fine dust, which finds its way behind doors and drop-cloths, into cabinets and storage bins.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fastidious housekeeper.  The ceiling-high piles of debris in my living room after demolition didn&#8217;t bother me so much.  Nor do the footprints on my carpets or the wear on my floors.  But this construction dust is disconcerting because there seems to be no escape from it. Looking back, I should have sealed off all the floors, furniture, and closets in my apartment very carefully before construction began.  It would have saved me some worry and a whole lot of cleaning.</p>

<p>This was what our entire house looked like when we purchased it. No, it was not finished to our standards but the bones of the house were perfect for us. It is about 2000 sq ft, three bedrooms, a large living room and kitchen, and windows on three side allowing for more light than a standard Brooklyn brownstone. The draw-back was that the last major remodel was done in 1910! That meant all new plumbing, electrical, heating and layout.</p>
<p>The layout included this &#8220;maid&#8217;s&#8221; room only accessible by stairs from the kitchen or through the bathroom. As much as I&#8217;d like a little help now and again I don&#8217;t have a cleaning person let alone a live in maid. The electrical and plumbing work had been redone by the previous owner using, what  I assume are all the skills  he learned from our local hardware store. The heating was done mostly by wood burning stove in the living room.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-676 mb-10" title="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg" alt="Maids Room Kitchen Wall After" width="540" height="360" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After.jpg 540w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Maids-Room-Kitchen-Wall-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><span class="img-label">Maid&#8217;s Room 2009, same view as above.</span></p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s room, like the rest of the house, was reworked to keep the character of the house but make it livable for years to come. We closed up the stairs. Removed the back closet and wall. And punched new windows in the back wall to let more light in and a view of our back yard.  Check out the full set of photos of the process <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/swee10/sets/72157619203431217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here. </a></p>
<p>After years of working in architecture offices on other peoples houses I thought this project would be easy and enjoyable. All told this room involved six subcontractors and it was neither easy nor enjoyable, but it should have been. For all my further projects I&#8217;m using  <a href="https://swee10.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swee10.com,</a> it&#8217;s everything I wish I&#8217;d had.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-596 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PROJECT-FILES.jpg" alt="PROJECT FILES" width="540" height="606" />When I manage a construction project in an architecture office I am terrifically, annoyingly organized. I respond to phone calls and emails immediately. I keep and file printed copies of all documents I receive and send. I develop filing systems so that all project documents are easy to find.</p>
<p>But when I began my home remodel I seemed to abandon all of these practices. I began with a bang, creating a binder with carefully labeled sections for existing conditions drawings, design sketches, product specifications, and reference images. I carried this binder with me as I shopped for products, packed it in my suitcase when I traveled, and left it on an end table right by my desk, so that I could reach it at any moment.</p>
<p>But before long I had much more information than could be stored in the binder. Piles sprang up around the binder, on top of it and on the floor below, piles of plumbing fixture catalogues, cabinet specifications, and outdated drawings. Eventually tile samples and paint chips found their way into these piles, and then cost estimates and invoices. The piles got higher and started spilling into one another and then into other, unrelated piles in my bedroom, piles of unsorted mail and trashy magazines. As a result there are no real project files for my home remodel project, only project piles.</p>
<p>When working in an office I keep a typed project directory, which lists the contact information for all the contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers on a project, and update the document weekly. For my home remodel I just slipped all the relevant business cards I had collected in a plastic sleeve, although I believe that there are still a few important ones swimming around at the bottom of my purse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-615 mb-24" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/PROJECT-DIRECTORY.jpg" alt="PROJECT DIRECTORY" width="540" height="671" /></p>
<p>Most of my communication with vendors and suppliers was through email, and most of my communication with my contractor Martin and his team was over the phone. Although I prefer email contractors always seem to prefer the phone. (Since my contractor Martin and the site supervisors, Brian and Joe, are Irish, it is always a pleasure to answer the phone and hear their lovely brogues, regardless of what they were actually saying to me.)</p>
<p>There were no scheduled site meetings but almost every morning I met with Brian and Joe and we talked about what work would be done that day and what steps would come next. They followed the drawings carefully but called me whenever they had specific questions. (Which way should the medicine cabinet door open? How thick is the kitchen countertop?) Martin came to the site about once each week, often after work hours, to review progress and discuss the schedule. Because it was a small remodel and a small team, this informal way of working worked well.</p>
<p>That is not the case with my record-keeping. Maybe because this project is so close to me, so personal, I abandoned my office habits and tried to manage it in a less regimental, hands-on way. It&#8217;s not something I would recommend. Keeping good records is the only way to track decisions and costs accurately. For my next remodel project, I&#8217;ll be sure to bring a more professional attitude to doing filing and paperwork.</p>
