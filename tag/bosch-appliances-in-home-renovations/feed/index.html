<h3>Wear-and-tear of a well-used kitchen shows</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 23 years since Susan and Carl bought a one-bedroom East Village co-op, they&#8217;ve made a lot of changes. “The history is long in this space,” said Susan, including withstanding 16 years of kids and dogs. She isn’t exaggerating. This couple bought the neighboring studio apartment in 1997, bumping up their square footage to 1,400. They hired someone to do the bare minimum to connect the two apartments and did everything else themselves. A few years later, while an “inept” contractor did a poor job of fixing up the bathroom, the couple went on to do a DIY job with the kitchen. A leaky dishwasher eventually ruined the flooring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With low interest rates, they decided to refinance their mortgage and renovate, which brings this story to the present day. Despite those DIY fixes, the kitchen wasn’t at its full potential. A dropped ceiling in certain areas eliminated what could be very useful storage space. The recessed canned lights hanging from the ceiling also made the kitchen feel small. Even with a cutout in the wall toward the living room, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/entertaining-kitchens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">layout didn&#8217;t suit entertaining</a>. “Whenever we had company,” said Susan, “everyone would squeeze into the end of the kitchen while I cooked and doled out snacks.”</p>
<h3>Finding the right expertise to get the job done</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the disaster of the bathroom contractor etched in their minds, Susan and Carl promised themselves to scrutinize the next person they worked with. They found Sweeten and posted their project, a choice that paid off many times over. For example, they discovered a beam that they feared would force them to shorten the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets and give up storage space</a>. But the Sweeten contractor they chose “knew exactly how to notch out the back of the taller cabinets to accommodate the beam,” said Susan.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29532 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg" alt="nyc kitchen renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Susan-Horwitz_Kitchen_ForBlog08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple spent hours on Pinterest and decided against uniformity in the long, narrow space, opting for family- and pet-friendly materials and layout instead. “We wanted to eliminate the bowling alley feel,” she said. This was achieved by mixing cabinets and shelves, as well as glass and solid doors, and horizontal and vertical lines. Moving the window gate from the inside to outside was another simple fix that made a big difference. That change now enables them to open the bottom half of the gate. They opted for a painted backsplash rather than tile. “It leaves open the possibility of changing colors when you get tired of it,” she said.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned from this East Village renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job went smoothly with no issues with her contractor—even though the &#8220;construction dust was hard to live with&#8221;—the couple still has tips for other renovators: 1. Triple your <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-kitchen-renovation-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline estimate</a> to get a realistic sense of how long a renovation will take, and 2. When your kitchen is out of order, there’s a lot you can do in a slow cooker and rice cooker, including pasta!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: This East Village renovation was full of pleasant surprises along the way. When their Sweeten contractor ripped out the dropped ceiling, Susan and Carl had expected to find something that would slow the project down. Instead, no wires, pipes or anything structural was found inside. “Compared to any other [renovation] jobs, nothing significant held us back with this one,” said Susan.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Elevating the best aspects of home</h3>
<p class="p8">We have been living in this apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, since 2015. It was the first place we lived together, and it felt like a real 1980s loft, which Sue and I liked a lot. The previous owner was crafty—he’d installed his own kitchen cabinets, and the spirit of the place was very DIY. Sue works in Fin-tech and I am in interior design. We didn’t do much work when we first moved in, thinking it made sense to let the apartment evolve.</p>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>The apartment comprises approximately 900 square feet. It had many vantage points, which our cat, who recently passed, really enjoyed. The neighborhood seems to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lot of industrial building conversions</a>—a church here, a school there, made into residential apartments. Our building belongs to the latter group, and was converted more than 30 years ago. Visitors are often amazed at how wide the hallways are. That sort of space is not something you often encounter in NYC.</p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Honing in on the shared lifestyle</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Looking to build on the apartment’s openness, we made a few changes early on. One was removing a spiral staircase and replacing it with an industrial-use stair; it remains in the same location in the current iteration. Another was taking out an idiosyncratic shelving system that the previous owner had installed. We are both utilitarian, and that aspect of our personalities influences our aesthetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-staircase-leading-to-loft" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg" alt="View of the black staircase leading to loft along with dining area and kitchen after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50882" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="dining-area-with-open-shelving" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Dining area with open shelving unit overlooking the black staircase leading to the loft after renovation" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50881" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/42020-AlexC-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We also like this word that the Dutch have, <i>Gezellig,</i> which translates to something like coziness. It’s not a style, per se, but achieving it was a driving force for our renovation. We didn’t want an overly designed space, but rather one that felt <i>considered.</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Practical launch pad to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated our renovation</a> to coincide with the water boiler warranty expiration. Each unit has its own boiler, and you always hear about these things failing shortly after their warranty goes. We figured we would try to avoid becoming a statistic. Another <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation to upgrade</a> was the desperate need for an electrical panel overhaul in the apartment. </span><span class="s1">We wanted to add an in-unit washer and dryer and a shower to our powder room. In addition, the apartment lacked, and desperately needed, built-in storage. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We posted our project, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> was a great help in providing a list of <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant contractors in Brooklyn</a>. Since I work in this field, I did not utilize other services the company provides. I wanted to complete the renovation within an allotted time frame, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep within a firm budget</a>. Our Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor proposed great ideas</a>. We had a few conversations before the renovation, and she was very accommodating. </span></p>
<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Design tricks-of-the-trade</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is always exciting to see a project on paper come to life, but it is especially interesting when you have an experimental client—in this case, ha!, ourselves. Our contractor convinced me that we should open up the entry foyer, which I wasn’t sure of. But in the end I think sacrificing the extra storage was worth it to expand the passageway. We also separated the passthrough between the dining and living space with an oversized barn door, which disappears when retracted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">We employed other tricks as well. Take the painting and color scheme, for example. We applied a World War I ship-camouflage technique known as Dazzle—which was a way of masking the volume and shape of military ships using geometric patterns—to try to make walls and objects more or less vanish into the space. We used black behind the TV to have it blend into the space. It is also a nod to the blackboard that would have hung on the wall in this former classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stayed with a pretty strict material palette just because it is easier to manage and is also a fun challenge to stretch the limit of the material. For example, the black countertop and black backsplash is actually a paper-based product that is extremely durable. I also used it as treads for the stairs.</span></p>

<h3 class="p7"><span class="s1">Being flexible during the process</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter how simple you aim to keep it, in any construction project, there will be challenges to overcome. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved out of the apartment</a> during the renovation, but I went to the job site every other day to make sure we were moving forward. During one visit, I noticed that the contracting team had framed one of the walls in the wrong location. Instead of losing time having the contractor demolish the framing and restart, however, I decided to redesign that portion of the space. I did it overnight. In the end, we were able to salvage the work and it turned out nicely. It felt serendipitous. </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Working from home for the past year, we were able to enjoy the apartment’s ample flow of sunlight throughout the day. It is great to have a space that works so well now and feels not just in sync with the building we live in, but with our entire lifestyle. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you have young children, you realize quickly what does and doesn’t work about the space you’re in. Common issues are a lack of storage or insufficient dining space. Perhaps you need a better flow between rooms. Or, it might be all of the above.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, three Sweeten renovations show how parents transformed kitchens and bathrooms into spaces that work for their families—adding functionality and, of course, beautiful form to their homes.</span></p>

<h4>An inhospitable kitchen</h4>
<p>Betsy, a teacher, and Zach, an executive at a retail company, live in a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex garden apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The couple now has Amina, age 2, and two dogs, Tristen and Archie. Their duplex in a 19th-century brownstone was in decent shape but didn’t quite match their design aesthetic.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><span class="s4">They held off on renovating for a few years, but once Amina was born, they decided to take the plunge and finally renovate to have their home suit their ever-changing needs. They wanted to make the most of their 1,200-square-foot main floor. “</span><span class="s1">We bought knowing we would ultimately like to renovate, but the apartment was pretty updated; it just wasn’t our aesthetic,” said Betsy. “We had been living in the space for nearly three years, and the kitchen was especially difficult.” The refrigerator was apartment-sized and the peninsula-shaped design meant that only one person could be in the space at a time. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">So <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/28307#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsy and Zach posted their project</a> on Sweeten to find a general contractor who could help with all of their design challenges and in addition fix the poor lighting in the main living area. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Mixing old with modern elements</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make more room and utilize the space more efficiently, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Sweeten contractor</a> reduced the size of the hall bathroom to add a bit more space to the tiny kitchen. The floors were converted from a dated yellow to a beautiful hardwood. They added a mix of traditional elements (classic hardwood floors) with a modern aesthetic (flat-panel cabinets). Multiple sources of lighting like a chandelier were installed over the main table as well as high hats to keep the open space bright and airy.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our Sweeten contractor was great in every small decision, from the pull-out storage options for utensils to hiding the unsightly microwave in a garage cabinet to making the fridge seamlessly blend into the cabinetry—a big feat considering we now have a 36” french door refrigerator,” said Betsy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When asked about her advice for renovators, Betsy had this to say: “Be smart about your budget. We went with a quote that was comfortably below our bottom line, and this gave us the flexibility to spend more in certain areas and save in others without constantly being stressed about going over.”</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking space to grow</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Paul, a collegiate swim coach, and Margaret, a pediatric nurse practitioner, bought their 1,</span><span class="s1">700-square-foot, two-bedroom condo, they knew they wanted to renovate it right away. “We had been living in the Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, but wanted more space for a growing family,” said Paul. “North Bergen’s mix of affordability, family-friendly amenities, and proximity to work appealed to us.” However, to make the house family-friendly, they turned to Sweeten. </span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul and Margaret posted their project </a>on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4145" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired a general contractor</a> to renovate their kitchen. “Sweeten was helpful in showing us qualified contractors in our area,” said Paul. “Being New Jersey residents, we valued Sweeten’s referral model.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They wanted a contractor who could take their kitchen into the 21st century, updating their old laminate-and-tile kitchen into a more modern space. They wished for additional counter space as well as storage—common must-haves for a young family. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new layout brings high impact results</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-granite-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50717 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="White kitchen with granite countertop along with double door fridge after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-with-glass-countertop" class="alignnone wp-image-50714 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White kitchen with glass countertop on a kitchen peninsula after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinetry-with-black-granite" class="alignnone wp-image-50716 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="White kitchen cabinetry with black granite countertop and double hung window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50727-Paul-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple worked with the firm to give their space a clean, contemporary feel without having to do a major overhaul. They didn’t remove or move any walls but they were able to reconfigure the existing layout to work better for their family. They extended the countertop and added cabinetry for additional storage. Plus, they included a nod to New York by way of a simple subway tile backsplash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Our contractor was helpful in keeping the project moving despite material delays and the start of the pandemic,” said Paul. These first-time renovators could not be happier with their now user-friendly new kitchen. </span></p>

<h4>Reduce clutter, expand livable space</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A 1925 side-hall colonial was in need of a remodel for homeowners Jennifer and Sauyee. They made plans to live in the 1,740-square-foot home in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, for a few years before embarking on a renovation. With two small children, they wanted to make sure when they did decide to renovate that they could pinpoint exactly what was needed to make their busy lives more convenient and comfortable.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The layout lacked usable counter space and had way too many countertop appliances to be functional. Plus, the flow from the kitchen to the rest of the house needed to be reconsidered to make it more family-friendly. They also desperately wanted more usable space and a lighter, brighter vibe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/63305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a reliable general contractor in their area. </span><span class="s1">Jennifer and Sauyee were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> and the work began.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Remodeling for family home cooking</span></h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The finished product is a more modern, usable space—one that reflects the couple’s personality and everyday needs. The pantry unit is perfect for the kids’ snacks as well as additional storage for their kitchen essentials. And even though it is not as obvious as some of the other aesthetic details, the homeowners are equally appreciative of the properly vented range hood. As a family of four, cooking is very important and any cook knows a bad vent hood can be a real nuisance. So, it was an upgrade they really wanted. They chose gray Shaker cabinets, light quartz countertops, and redid the hardwood floors throughout to make a cohesive design statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-dining-space-with-dining-table" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50727 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="White dining space with dining table on a hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-walk-in-shower" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50730" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="White bathroom with walk in shower along with a pedestal washbasin and a rectangle bathroom mirror" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/63305-Jennifer-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, they decided to also remodel the bathroom since the kitchen was getting a facelift. They went with a gray color palette: <span class="s5">light, marble-style tile for the floor and shower wall, with an accent dark, geometric shower floor. But t</span><span class="s1">heir favorite part? The heated floors—appreciated by the kids and adults alike. </span></p>

<h3>Technical needs take priority over aesthetics</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew from the beginning that the electrical work needed to be upgraded, and I included that important aspect of the job when I posted my project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. </span><span class="s4">I took part in the initial consultations with contractors via Zoom, and then met the ones that interested me in person.

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The plan was to </span><span class="s2">replace the electrical box and redistribute the power, since I’d been having constant issues when I used multiple appliances simultaneously. We would also </span><span class="s1">improve the lighting by installing new fixtures and switches.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">A plumber assessed that the old pipes and a plumbing line</span><span class="s1"> would need to be replaced before putting in a new sink and faucet. Those fixes would be particularly essential since I wanted to install a dishwasher for the first time.</span></p>

<h4>A 180-degree kitchen remodel</h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Of course, I felt most excited about the things that were visible. I hoped to find a source for small, good-quality small-sized appliances. I wanted to use Ikea cabinets and replace the countertops and backsplash. We would redo the kitchen top to bottom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from refinishing the walls</a> and soffits to putting down a new floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This was not my first renovation, but my first time doing a major teardown and remodel. I had a lot of questions about the cabinets and having enough storage space, in addition to the technical updates. My Sweeten contractor helped so much during the planning phase. I asked a lot of questions before we started. She provided great suggestions.</span></p>
<h3>Spotlight on compact appliances for small spaces</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The renovation was straightforward: No walls were moved and no layout changes were made. </span><span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50276 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with brass fixtures and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With this in mind, my biggest choices were the appliances and the cabinets. It was a challenge finding reasonably priced and attractive compact appliances—when you’re looking for 18-, 20- or 24-inch models, choices are limited. I found the dishwasher, but t</span><span class="s4">he hood took a long time. I didn&#8217;t want one that stuck out, and anything less than 24 inches seemed nonexistent. When I found this 20-inch model, I ordered it right away—but then it came and we had no idea how to make it ductless! Note to apartment dwellers: A ductless hood, or one that can be adapted with a kit, is what you need. </span><span class="s1">By the time I found these items, I’d <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to go with custom cabinets</a>, to make life easier and maximize space.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h4>A unique blend of color and pattern</h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, with custom cabinets, I had an opportunity to be creative with color.</span> <span class="s6">Initially, I’d envisioned light-gray cabinets with wood flooring. Then I changed my mind and</span><span class="s1"> looked at patterned vinyl flooring; in the end, I decided to </span><span class="s6">totally</span><span class="s1"> contrast it to the wood floor in the living area</span><span class="s6">. Looking at it with paint chips, a paint color called Brittany Blue—a light gray-blue with a warm-gray undertone—looked best for the cabinets.</span><span class="s1"> The color wasn’t far from what I had imagined, and it was a really good decision.</span> <span class="s1">I wanted a gold tone as an accent color, so I chose brass handles for the doors and drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When it came to the island, I got even bolder. I purchased it online and when it came, I didn&#8217;t like the color, so I decided to experiment. I’d seen a photo of a kitchen that had purple cabinets. I remembered it because that color choice was so unusual and didn&#8217;t look dated. Painting that island was a fun project.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I chose quartz for the countertops and wanted to continue with the same material for the backsplash. For a small kitchen, it made a lot of sense, especially in terms of budget, since it didn’t cost anything extra to install.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50281 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with eat-in nook" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50277 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with quartz countertop and microwave storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">For the lighting, I was less involved than I expected to be. </span><span class="s1">I wanted overall lighting and also a fixture above the dining table. My contractor and electrician suggested installing LED lights above the cabinets, which turned out to be my favorite aspect of the renovation. The lights are dimmable, and such an upgrade from just a single ceiling fixture.</span></p>
<h3>Good communication—the key to a successful remodel</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Throughout the process, I was so happy to have my Sweeten contractor’s input.</span><span class="s1"> When something on my list cost too much, she always came up with an alternative solution that worked just as well. Also, from the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that’s one reason why it went so smoothly.</span> <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also stayed in touch</a> and helped with project flow by checking in periodically. There weren’t any issues, but I liked knowing I had a fallback in case something went wrong. I think I worried less throughout the renovation as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The project worked out so well that it’s hard to list just one thing I love about it. I am truly pleased with the new kitchen’s flow, and the look of the whole room tops even what I had hoped it could be. I am really happy with the result.</span></p>

<h3>From Renting to Buying</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for real estate. I even work in real estate tech as a product manager. Since moving to the city over 10 years ago, I’ve spent my fair share of time looking at listings of apartments for sale. After many years in tiny Manhattan studios (think 300 square feet), it was time to get serious about buying an apartment.</p>

<p>I started to hunt for Manhattan apartments (with a preference for downtown) that were both affordable and true one-bedrooms. I spent around nine months going to open houses on Sundays, and after seeing many apartments, I finally stumbled upon the space I ended up buying in Chelsea.</p>
<p>It might have been how quiet and calm the apartment felt, but it was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true one-bedroom in a prewar building and has much of its original charm: a sunken living room and beautiful arches. But the original kitchen was the size of a closet. I used the fact that it was outdated as negotiating leverage and was able to bring the purchase price significantly below asking (a rarity in Manhattan).</p>

<h3>Deciding Who to Hire</h3>
<p>After asking around, I realized that finding a general contractor to do work in a Manhattan co-op was no easy task. I stumbled upon Sweeten, and after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting my job</a> there, I connected with a few general contractors. I didn’t go the architect route because it would have added to my budget on top of the renovation materials. Also, I wasn&#8217;t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning any significant structural change</a>s. For a one-bedroom renovation, that extra cost is just enough to push the cost over the return. Without an architect, however, finding a detail-oriented general contractor who is on top of their game was paramount. That’s exactly what I found with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3275#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sweeten contractor I chose</a>.</p>

<h3>Must-Have: An Oven to Fit a Turkey</h3>
<p>The biggest part of the remodel was gutting my tiny kitchen. I hired a kitchen designer to help me optimize the layout. She came up with configurations I couldn’t imagine possible in a 70-square-foot space. As an avid cook, I had a few (okay, maybe slightly crazy) requirements: a full size 30” stove, a large refrigerator, and a dishwasher. I was told the most I’d fit into the space was a 24” stove, but my heart was set on fitting a large turkey into my oven. And after much finagling, we found a layout that allowed for everything I wanted and more (somehow, I even fit a wine fridge).</p>

My Sweeten contractor worked closely with me to come up with a solution: a combination of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/kitchen-cabinets/buying-guide/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom and standard cabinets</a>. We spent two hours talking through cabinet door sizes as well as placement so that the doors were symmetrical and made sense for the space. (Trust me, this guy pays a lot of attention to detail.) For my peninsula, he took the lead on creating both a practical layout and aesthetically pleasing geometric shape. There needed to be enough room to pass when walking into the apartment (the front door is right near the kitchen).</p>

<h3>A Refresh for the Apartment</h3>
<p>Beyond the kitchen, the remainder of the renovation was giving the apartment a facelift. I refinished the floors, stripped the door frames down to their original steel, replaced the baseboards, changed the grout in the bathroom, added a closet in the bedroom, and put a nice layer of paint on all of the walls.</p>
<h3>Delivery Saga</h3>
<p>While much of the kitchen renovation was a fun process, I’d be lying if I said there weren’t bumps along the way. Most of my friends do not believe me when I tell them I bought six sinks for the kitchen. Yep, you read that right: six sinks. To make a long story short: there was a farmhouse sink that was too shallow (thankfully, my contractor pointed this out to me), one that fell off a truck during delivery, another that arrived and didn&#8217;t fit, another that arrived then got lost (and eventually found again), and two others that ended up getting returned. When the sink saga was over, my boyfriend told me he never wanted to talk about another sink again. And honestly, who could blame him?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up with a beautifully renovated home that stayed true to its prewar nature. A common question I was asked after completing my renovation was: Would I do it all over again? You betcha.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Kayla and Jesse, for sharing your refreshed home!</em></p>

<h3>Renovation plan: living in the space</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To say I won the real estate lottery might feel like an overstatement, but after a short hunt, I found a Brooklyn Heights co-op in a 1920s building. It had everything I had been looking for—two bedrooms, a corner unit, lots of windows, high ceilings, and a single block from multiple subway stations. The only drawback was that the place needed a lot of work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before moving in I did some things that really needed doing: <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting in new hardwood floors</a>, fully gutting the original bathroom, and installing updated electrical and lighting. At the time, the idea of touching the kitchen was out of the question—and budget. But it was, thankfully, the newest portion of the apartment and didn’t necessarily need work yet. It also had a weird layout that didn’t exactly scream a clear solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a bit of a perfectionist, so I had a plan for my remodel. The key was living in the apartment long enough to come up with the right solution before demolition started.</p>

<h3>Planning the new kitchen layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I knew I wanted a kitchen that felt open to the living room with lots of storage (this is NYC). I also wanted a new layout that still provided some sort of entryway and coat closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I moved in, I began thinking about and talking about my most recent, “brilliant” plan for the kitchen layout to friends and family. First, I was set on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an island, then a peninsula</a>, and then I thought about moving the plumbing. I realized that I had to narrow down what was (and wasn’t) working for the kitchen.</p>

<blockquote><p>They created a sleek bookshelf that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout technically had a lot of counter prep space, but it was in two separate areas, so I often had my back to my guests while I cooked. I loved the giant coat closet within the “entry,” but keeping it meant my options were limited. The appliances were in decent shape, though oversized for the space. A weird drop ceiling over part of the kitchen made it feel disconnected from the rest of the living room. This ceiling, coupled with a half-height wall that separated the front door from the kitchen, made the kitchen feel smaller than it actually was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31159" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Adding a drop ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five years and probably quite a few exasperated friends and co-workers later, I settled on a plan for the kitchen. There would be no island and no peninsula. Everything was out from floor-to-ceiling. The huge coat closet was partially removed to make room for custom cabinets, panel-ready appliances, and a new drop ceiling that mirrored the curve of the floor transition from new tile to my existing hardwood floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the coat closet gone, I decided to expand the closet in my bedroom to make up for the lost space. Aesthetically, I’ve always loved blue cabinets and knew that I wanted to do darker kitchen cabinets with a lighter floor and a whiter countertop with some wood accents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I chose a separate cooktop and oven because the space I had for the stove was much deeper than a traditional countertop and I wanted to take full advantage of the space I had. I also wanted the appliances to look seamless and fully integrated. Plus, I hate the weird space that always happens between a stove and the cabinet where dirt and food collects.</p>

<h3>Two prep zones</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get more workable counter space, I moved the stove to another wall. The original location of the refrigerator was a perfect spot. The sink remained on its original wall and was centered in order to get counter space on either side and keep it close to the cooktop/oven. By doing this, I <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/5-things-we-can-learn-about-kitchen-zones-from-this-diagram-kitchen-design-lessons-216828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created two zones for prep</a> on each side of the sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I made the decision about the sink and cooktop/oven, I knew that the old coat closet had to be downsized to make room for the refrigerator. I opted for a panel-ready refrigerator because I felt like opening the front door and having a seamless wall of cabinetry would help mitigate the fact that you were walking right into the kitchen. Functionally, I was also trying to create a triangle between my sink, cooktop/oven, and the refrigerator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just to the left of the refrigerator happened to be the perfect location for a pantry. I had some built-in, pull-out drawers earmarked for my pots and pans and a simple pull-out wire drawer (it was super easy to install!) for my pantry items. With storage, food, and the refrigerator covered, I used the remaining space to the right of the refrigerator to create a new coat closet.</p>

<h3>Seamless transition between kitchen and living area</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the way my apartment “boundaries” were, there was a funny niche on the TV wall into which a counter and cabinets were installed. With the new design, there&#8217;s storage below where my microwave and toaster oven live and “open” storage above to display my pretty kitchen items. The glass doors open and can be tucked away so the countertop can be used as a bar top for parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also wanted to have a place to eat. By pushing my living room furniture closer to the window, I made room for a new dining table and chairs. I had the pendant lights installed over the table. Extra work had to be done to build out the beam in the ceiling to hide the electrical boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much like the kitchen design, the idea of a built-in at the window had been on my mind since I bought the apartment. With a millworker already doing custom cabinets, I figured the built-in should be done as well. A sleek bookshelf was created that also hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows. I selected a “piano” finish on the top of the bookshelf for easy cleanup. I’m looking forward to exercising my hopefully-green thumb.</p>

<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="dining area" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 " style="font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<h3>Consider all possibilities</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I optimistically planned for a “quick” two-month renovation, during which I lived in the second bedroom with all my possessions and a microwave. Of course, it took almost three months before I could move back into my own bedroom, and another two months before the project finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My advice for anyone preparing for a renovation: take your time. Do your research; debate all the possibilities. It was better to wait and mull over all my plans (for years!) before making the investment. Using Sweeten helped with the process of finding a contractor. I appreciated being able to read references and see photos of previous projects, which helped me see the quality of each contractor’s work.</p>
<h3>Brighter and more functional home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-do-architects-renovate-their-own-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovating my own space as an architect</a> was good and bad: good because I knew what I wanted and how to articulate it to the contractor. But also bad, or rather tricky, because I knew exactly what I wanted and expected a specific level of quality and detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final result was worth the discomfort and occasional tears. I’m incredibly happy with my new space. The kitchen is so bright and open,  and the layout is functional with tons of storage. Bonus: I was even able to make space for a proper dining table! Now, instead of talking to my friends about renovating, we talk about about the next time they’re coming for dinner.</p>

<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with three general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socialize–that became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jim’s dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paint—now a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boys’ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. We’re not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was right—it’s a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didn’t initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg" alt="pattern tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47056 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg" alt="open shelving kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47055 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg" alt="blue kitchen cabinetry" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-47059 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3>Lightening the mood</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I could have done a lot worse than this hand-me-down—a West Village apartment that my mom and dad purchased in 2016. My sister, Lindsay, lived in the studio for a couple of years until she moved in with her boyfriend in Brooklyn. I’d gotten my career in fundraising events off the ground, and I decided to leave my roommates in Murray Hill and move in.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg" alt="white family room with large picture window and white brick fireplace and tray ceiling with recessed lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48189" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Taylor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The apartment is in a co-op building that was built in 1915. It’s small—approximately 320 square feet—and had accumulated some </span><span class="s5">questionable design touches from long ago</span><span class="s1">. Paneled walls, painted in a pretty but dark shade of teal, and distressed wood trim gave the place a downbeat vibe. It was so dark that I had at times referred to it as “The Dungeon.” Brightening the space was my priority.</span></p>

<h3>Choosing materials for resale in the future</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renovating the studio apartment</a> was a family project, planned with my </span><span class="s1">mom, Reneé, and my dad, John. This was our first renovation in New York City and we were nervous. We didn’t know where to find a contractor or what standard pricing would be. Where to start? To add to the challenge, we decided to keep the budget down by not hiring a designer. I would make most of the design decisions myself. We started by posting our project to <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46932" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-05-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It’s best to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know the process and design plan</a> before you start a project. I wanted it to feel light, warm, cozy, and fun. It also felt important to create a home that would appeal to future buyers. As much as I love this place, it’s a studio—it likely won’t be my “forever home.” So I tried to pick materials that <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept the kitchen current and timeless</a> and the bathroom neutral. I created a document with inspiration photos and a materials list for each room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared it with our Manhattan contractor</a> as soon as we offered him the job.</span></p>

<span class="s1">&#8220;Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful sourcing the products I wanted.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My family and I agreed we would tear out the ugly paneling in hopes of <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening up the studio&#8217;s main living</a> and sleeping space; white walls and recessed lighting would brighten the space. Meanwhile, painting the window in charcoal frames the natural light coming in. </span><span class="s1">Next up was the kitchen, which had newish appliances, but needed most everything else, from repainting the cabinets to new floor tile, countertops, and backsplash. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refresh the bathroom</a>, we would paint, replace wall and floor tiles, update the shower, and add a new vanity, mirror, and lighting fixtures.</span></p>
<h3>Discovering hidden arches</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We were excited when our general contractor got started at the beginning of March 2020. During demolition, we found the arched doorways inside the apartment. We’d had no idea about these beautiful, curved pass-throughs—they’d been covered up with drywall and paneling. It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s original charm still intact. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46937 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To modernize, we focused on lighting and thought about storage (a vanity with storage and a wall-mounted shoe rack)—vital aspects of the project in this tiny space. </span><span class="s1">I gave a lot of thought to creating a mix of open and closed storage. All the pretty stuff goes on the open shelving, and everything unsightly or rarely used has a spot to hide in.</span></p>
<h3>Renovating during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once we’d started working, the biggest challenge we had was dealing with COVID-19. A couple of weeks after our demolition phase, New York City shut down. Our Sweeten contractor was helpful in dealing with all the new health-related laws, as well as our co-op’s rules. As the pandemic escalated, only a few workers were allowed on-site, staying distanced; toward the end, it was only one worker at a time.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46928" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46929" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I ended up leaving Manhattan to quarantine at my family’s home, and as the situation worsened, most design choices had to be discussed over text, email, or FaceTime. Our contractor had great ideas, and one particular staffer was super helpful in <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sourcing the products</a> I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">After a last-minute decision to change the floors, within a few hours, I found floor samples, ordered them for curbside pickup, chose, and ordered the boards so our contracting team could pick them up at an NYC location. Our contractor installed them the next day. It was stressful, but I love what we ended up with!</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="West Village bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46930" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-Bathroom-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The challenges of the pandemic pushed our timeline from two months to three, but we didn’t care—we wanted the work to be done safely. Our contractor was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diligent in our communication</a> emailing us progress photos every week and scheduling FaceTime walkthroughs. He notified our building’s management company and us if loud work was planned so that neighbors could be warned. This was especially important since everyone was working from home!</span></p>
<h3>Reno tips from the homeowner</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even in these lean and uncertain times, my advice is to add a buffer to the budget—there is always a surprise, or a little project, to add. I love the creative side, picking out materials, and deciding what worked best together. We certainly did not <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep costs under our budget</a>. Not even close! We ended up spending about $70,000 on this project.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the end, thanks to my family, luck, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding our Sweeten contractor</a>, I’m immensely happy! It’s so comforting to come home. I wanted to modernize the apartment, brighten it, and bring it into this decade—and that’s precisely what we did.</span></p>

<h3>Before: Renovate an outdated Brooklyn kitchen</h3>
<p>Longtime renters Marc and Steve dreamed of having a place of their own. Their search for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn eventually led them to an unexpected choice: a co-op or house? The townhouse, they discovered, was a short commute (only two express train stops) from Manhattan. It would provide more space than a one-bedroom apartment and not have the maintenance fees that go with living in a co-op. After purchasing their new home, they lived in it for seven months before turning their attention to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“It was perhaps the most outdated room and we knew it needed a major renovation,” Marc said. The existing cabinets were grimy and had broken doors. Some were so high up that they were almost unusable. The countertops had seen better days. The too-big appliances—combined with a low drop ceiling—made it feel like the walls were closing in on the already small space.</p>

<h3>After: Creating the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; list and choosing the contractor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a list of must-haves that included a full-size dishwasher and additional storage space, Marc and Steve set out to plan a renovation. “Before Sweeten, we weren&#8217;t sure how to find a contractor we could trust,” Marc said. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Posting his project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> led him to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After reading through great reviews and discussing the contractor&#8217;s past work with Sweeten, he felt confident he was making the right choice and accepted his contractor&#8217;s bid.</p>
<p><a href="http://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46407" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png" alt="Get Matched With Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CTA-GetMatched-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fans of the classic, black-and-white New York kitchen, the couple aimed to create a bright space with a clean look, layering plenty of white to make the space feel bigger. “The kitchen needed to be truly functional and not just pretty,” Marc said. As for the design, “we landed on something like ‘a traditional white kitchen goes modern.&#8217;” With a contractor on board, they were finally on their way to the modern black and white kitchen renovation of their dreams.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48203 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Marc-Floor-1.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Planning and ordering kitchen cabinets</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The need to demo the entire space meant that measuring would have to wait and the new cabinets—which usually require some lead time—couldn’t be ordered before work began. The couple decided on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> and Semihandmade doors because they would arrive sooner than a fully customized set (although Marc noted that the cabinet door delivery took longer than planned). He also mentioned taking advantage of running the cabinets from top to bottom on two walls to get as much storage as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With cabinets of varying sizes, they chose flat-panel doors to streamline the look rather than the Shaker-style that was initially under consideration. The couple opted for full-size appliances (they got their dishwasher!) since they cook and bake on a daily basis, while a counter-depth fridge was installed to save some space and make room for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry cabinet</a>. For unity between the backsplash and countertop, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble-looking quartz</a> was selected for both surfaces. To let in more light, their contractor also widened the window over the sink to give a clear view of the garden.</p>

<h3>Marc + Steve&#8217;s renovation tips</h3>
<p>Overall, the renovation took closer to three months—“a month or so longer than we hoped,” Marc shared. “But it was worth it!” While waiting on cabinet doors, his contractor tackled smaller projects, adding new baseboards and trim to the main living area, hanging pendants over the dining table, and removing the drop ceiling that continued throughout the rest of the ground floor. Marc tells us that working with his contractor was a great experience. “We are perfectionists, so we&#8217;d come home to see the work done each day and have a bunch of questions. He always answered patiently and quickly, or fixed things as soon as he could.”</p>
<p><strong>The couple&#8217;s advice to future renovators:</strong> “Check return policies on everything. We ordered a range hood online that wasn&#8217;t what we thought it was. They wouldn’t let us return it because you have to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reject it immediately at delivery</a>.” Another tip: Dust is going to get everywhere, even with a contractor who&#8217;s careful, so be prepared for some <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/clean-up-after-major-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean-up after the work</a> is done.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34326" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Marc-Kitchen.gif" alt="kitchen storage" width="816" height="1224" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />Why they love their new Sweeten kitchen</h3>
<p>The new space feels light and airy—and much bigger than before. “We can both stand in the kitchen at the same time and it&#8217;s not overly crowded,&#8221; Marc said. &#8220;Design-wise, it&#8217;s the kitchen we always wanted and I don&#8217;t think we have any regrets about the choices we made (and there were so many choices!).”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Marc and Steve were most excited for the new kitchen floor and the “wow” moment they achieved with patterned black-and-white tile.</p>

</ul>
<h3>A living room renovation gives room for a fave sport</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes even man-cave passions are well worth making room for. Designer Bennett Gale knew this when he agreed to help his friend Dan, who had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a one-bedroom apartment</a> in a 1960 New York City building, with its remodel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“For the longest time, the only piece of furniture that Dan had—before he even bought a bed—was a pool table,” recalled Bennett, who works as a project manager for a luxury real-estate developer. The dark-wood billiards console—sturdy, angular, and clad in camel-toned felt—was a prized possession and an essential feature in the project. Dan, a finance executive who’d moved into the co-op about a year before starting on the redesign, had made it the apartment’s centerpiece.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pool table in a Manhattan apartment may sound like a literal elephant in the room, but Bennett, who had been close with Dan since college, understood its importance and was happy to discuss it. The table had a modern design and good bones. With a set of 4 &#8211; 5 table leaves that let it multitask as a dining surface, the nifty four-legged table was also practical—Dan had gathered many a friend around it. The issue was that his otherwise sparsely set living room felt tight when the table was in use. “I wanted to create more space around it,” said Dan. Plus, more elbow room would be useful for pool cues!</span></p>
<h3>Planning an entertainment space at home</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dan and Bennett worked together to post the job on Sweeten and soon hired a contractor. Then they set out to upgrade the co-op into the ultimate bachelor’s pad. (Note: Dan&#8217;s girlfriend has moved in since the renovation—and reportedly, loves the space.) The original scope of the project, Bennett said, grew substantially. “We’d planned to open up the wall between the kitchen and the living room, but once we dug into the plans, it became clear that by taking out a few walls and relocating a closet, we could make better use of the space.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He proposed a full reconfiguration that would knock out a lot of flow-hampering sheetrock, give the kitchen an eye-catching redo, and elevate the living room to become a spacious entertaining hub. The makeover would bring light and a chic, loft-like sprawl to the downtown apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversations about specifics began in the kitchen. Bennett and Dan put a lot of research into cohesive surfacing choices. “Dark-wood parquet flooring dominates a lot of the space,” Bennett said, “so we lightened up the walls and chose materials that coordinated with the wood.” Dan opted for kitchen cabinets in a custom textured veneer with blond accents; dark matte-bronze cabinet hardware and coordinating lighting fixtures complement the stained wood. The natural marble that Dan settled on for the countertops is a warm white with earth-toned veining that echoes the deep brown pool and dining table.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45404 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="kitchen bar" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bennett-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Sample testing the countertop materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quality and durability were primary factors. Dan had decided to go “all in” on <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural marble for the countertops</a> and backsplash. “We did countless tests on countertop samples in order to determine whether we should go with honed marble or polished,” Bennett said. “Olive oil, red wine, hot sauce, pickle juice, and soda were tested to observe how it would stain or etch.” Dan chose a matte honed finish, which is more resistant to discoloration and allows scratches and marks to blend. “From multiple slabs, we identified one with as much veining and movement as possible,” Bennett said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With materials picked and sourced, the real work began. The crew opened the kitchen, installed cabinetry and appliances, and created a three-stooled stretch of counter seating on the opening’s living-room side. From there, the apartment’s other unnecessary walls got the sledgehammer. Bennett’s plan included taking out a hallway wall to give more space around the pool table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To complete the space expansion, the removal of a corner closet revealed a protruding column. Bennett designed a dry bar to fill the accidental niche. “That awkward corner became a great opportunity,” Bennett said. “We negotiated with the contractor to have the bar included in the build-out. It ended up as a great display.” The closet was relocated to an oversized and inefficient foyer.</span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Choosing the right general contractor team</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As is the case in most every home-construction job, the team hit some snags. During demolition, contractors discovered that the electrical wiring needed to be upgraded. Bennett emphasizes the importance of reading and understanding co-op or condo board rules and sharing them with contractors, who must not only work within the regulations, but also lock in the appropriate licenses and insurance coverages for the project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cooperative relationship between the construction crew and building staff is an absolute must, according to Bennett. “Get the super involved early,” he says. &#8220;These individuals almost always have previous experience with renovations in the building, and can often provide valuable insight on the exact issues you’ll encounter.” Fortunately, Dan received support from Sweeten throughout the process, and from Bennett, his friend (and architect!) “I would have been lost without his experience, guidance, and recommendations, not to mention his help pushing back on the contractors and the building when I needed it,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All challenges aside, though, “I’m very happy with the finished product,” Dan said. “I accomplished exactly what I was looking to do.” </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Bennett and Dan, for sharing the results of a great collaboration! </em></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Dara</em></p>
<h3>Figuring out the best layout for the apartment</h3>
<p>Our building was originally constructed in 1930, possibly for officers of the Navy Yard located several blocks north. Like many buildings in NYC, it turned into a co-op in the &#8217;80s. The overall layout of the apartment was great, with a lot of natural light, but the configuration of the space in both bathrooms, as well as the kitchen, was awkward.</p>
<p>Mauricio, an architect, and I wanted to open up the kitchen so that all four of us, including our 5-year-old twins, could move around it comfortably while adding counter space and enlarging the existing island. But solving that problem was really challenging. We must have gone through at least ten different layouts.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We discussed everything from a standard galley kitchen layout, to relocating the gas line and stove,</span><span class="s2"> but nothing felt quite right. Then we said, &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">hat if we extend the kitchen by taking a bit of space away from the adjacent</span><span class="s2"> dining room?&#8221; Ultimately, we realized that by </span><span class="s1">moving the fridge and aligning it with an enlarged island,</span><span class="s2"> we could seamlessly expand the kitchen </span><span class="s1">without sacrificing room for our dining table</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p>The kitchen remodel worked, and now we have a much bigger kitchen with a lot more storage and prep space. We even have huge cabinets underneath our island. Most importantly, our dining room is still perfectly roomy.</p>

<h3>Renovation tip to help save time</h3>
<p>We planned for minimal construction and maximum impact.  The access point <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the washer and dryer</a> was moved from the master bedroom to the third bedroom by easily rotating it in its existing space, rather than relocating it. That way, you don’t need to walk through the master to do a load of laundry. It also allowed us a larger shower.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We opened up the “den” off the living room</span><span class="s2"> by removing built-ins along three walls </span><span class="s1">to create a more flexible space as a TV room and an office</span><span class="s2">. We saved money and time tailoring modular closets to our needs rather than building out new closets. </span>Non-layout items we needed to address included fixing the electric panel and installing new hardwood floors since the original wood was as thin as the veneer.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, we kept in mind our 3 R&#8217;s mantra: Things needed to be easily <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repairable, replaceable, or recyclable</a>. Most of our purchases were made from local stores that had minimum to no lead time. We chose not to do anything custom until our kids stopped sharing a bedroom when they get older; we might need to rethink some of the spaces.</p>

<h3>Compromising on style</h3>
<p>In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences. I chose a more eclectic style in the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles. In the master bathroom, Mauricio preferred a more streamlined and minimalist look with grays and whites with a floating white glossy vanity.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the kitchen cabinets, we went with Ikea, that we could upgrade to semi-custom later on. We wanted solid hardwood that was reminiscent in the color of the original floor, but more modern looking. We chose a white oak in wide planks.</p>
<h3>A good-working Sweeten reno team</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor and his dad made a great team. He was very easy to talk to, and his dad was quite resourceful, with many solutions for various problems we encountered along the way. We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through. We could debate different ideas with him, but he was never pushy or non-communicative.</p>
<h3>Avoiding subcontractor issues</h3>
<p>One thing we would do differently is to put all of the renovation items (except finishes) under the contractor umbrella. We bought our countertop slabs from a local store, which encouraged us to use their fabricator rather than using our contractor to oversee the subcontractors. At installation, there were problems with sizing and fit. The fabricator blamed the contractor for moving the kitchen cabinets. Meanwhile, the contractor blamed the fabricator for cutting a countertop that didn’t fit. If the fabricator had been a subcontractor of our contractor, and under his supervision, that would have all been avoided.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re extremely happy with our home. After the full renovation of our apartment, all four of us can have breakfast at the kitchen island with room to spare. Plus, with all of the closets plus the kitchen storage, we finally have enough space to store everything. It all makes us happy on a daily basis. <span class="s1">Now we are gearing up for renovating our rooftop, to create an outdoor space for our family that rivals the interior.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancé, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a> and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge. </span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.</span></i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to work—her x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshua’s partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor’s keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractor’s desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall short—wrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshua’s eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sides—four very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. I’d notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. “Just think of it like camping,” Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. “I’m so nervous,” I admitted. &#8220;Don’t worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;You’re gonna love it.”  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, “I didn’t realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.” We couldn’t relish it more!</span></p>

<h3>Keeping it together but separate</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The truth is we had a long list of desires when it came to buying our first home together. We wanted a house that was true to the time it was built, but clean and crisp and modernized. We bought it knowing that it needed a renovation, and as such lined up our contractor as we were finalizing the purchase. We wanted to start our renovation within a week of the closing and pay both mortgage and rent for no more than eight weeks. </span></p>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44178 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg" alt="portrait, NYC, Brooklyn, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Portrait-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Stephen’s mother was moving in with us, and she is <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to manage stairs</a>, we needed a first-floor space for her. The house was a two-family home, with an upstairs apartment that was separate from the garden-level duplex. We decided to create a single-family house using the parlor level as entertaining space, allowing us to live separately, but together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a background in interior design and Stephen has renovation experience, but this was for both of us our first construction project in New York City. Our vision was of a house that would feel contiguous </span><span class="s1">but not too chopped up and not sterile. To that end, we drew lines with a well-curated mix of surfaces, and the outcome is fantastic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg" alt="townhouse living room" width="1000" height="670" class="alignnone wp-image-44177 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-8-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Real hardwood floors</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house most needed a revamp on the garden and top floors along with proper bedrooms and a full-house fire/CO2 monitoring system. </span><span class="s2">Our plan was to tear out the existing fake-wood flooring on both levels and replace it with hardwood, and</span><span class="s1"> save the original floors on the parlor level</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s1">We chose a dark-wood flooring with a hand-scraped finish that was not ridiculously expensive. We needed it to hold up to kids, dogs, a walker, and it really has. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg" alt="Living room" width="1000" height="1493" class="alignnone wp-image-44176 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-LivingRoom-7-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9.jpg" alt="dining room" width="1000" height="1478" class="alignnone wp-image-44163 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-DiningRoom-9-600x887.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">On the garden level where my mother-in-law has her own ap</span></span><span class="s1"><span class="s1">artment, the foyer was updated with full marble slabs on the walls and floor. In the back,</span>the laundry room got a better egress to the backyard. Additionally, it functions as a mudroom with custom cabinetry and a pull-down drying rack where we can hang wet clothes. The bathroom received a simple replacement of fixtures and a coat of paint which changed it completely</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">Storage in the kitchen</h3>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="663" class="alignnone wp-image-44166 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-300x199.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-13-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg" alt="kitchen seating area" width="1000" height="671" class="alignnone wp-image-44168 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-300x201.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-15-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The existing kitchen was L-shaped with very little counter space and a mobile dishwasher. As</span><span class="s1"> a big cooking family, we are very heavy users of the kitchen. By shifting the main k</span>itchen to one wall—including a dishwasher, wall oven, and a larger sink—it provided space for an island, a wrap-around pantry, and dining table.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry, kitchen pantry, wraparound pantry, kitchen, multigenerational kitchen, construction, home renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much the wrap-around pantry holds. Since it&#8217;s the other main kitchen wall, we could only fit 12&#8243;-15&#8243; deep cabinets. Instead of upper and lowers, we installed full-height 15&#8243; upper cabinets and are able to store an enormous amount of pantry and serving items. <span class="s1">The cabinet finishes are white and acacia and topped with a highly durable quartz surface including a big, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walk-around island</a>.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg" alt="stairs" width="1000" height="1497" class="alignnone wp-image-44165 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Entryway-10-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1">Heading up to the parlor floor, we removed the stair runner and painted the stair treads, risers, balusters, and spindles in one color. We used the black paint in a flat finish on the stair boards, and a pearl finish on the railings for extra luster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg" alt="kids bedroom" width="1000" height="672" class="alignnone wp-image-44162 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Child-Bedroom-1-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Specific bathroom features</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom gut reno on the top floor focused on creating a stand-up shower. Stephen and I travel a lot for work and have huge pet peeves. We wanted to turn on the water without getting wet and have a shelf or bench to put a foot upon or sit on. We chose a glass surround with a frameless structure to make the room feel as open as possible. The custom vanity is made of walnut, with four drawers that maximize countertop and storage space. It all fits nicely in a tiny-but-functional 5’ x 8’ bathroom space.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg" alt="walk in shower" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44179 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg" alt="bathroom open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44181 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-5-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We ended up skim coating almost the entire house, and our Sweeten contractor worked miracles on the original plaster that was uneven and had an unappealing, thick texture. <span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">It gave us a lot more understanding of how hard it really is to properly repair plaster so that it looks like new!</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg" alt="shower seat" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-44180 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Upstairs-Bathroom-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most difficult part of the renovation was the last six weeks, when we were living in the house, still under construction, with a three-year-old. Living in a space being renovated is challenging and exhausting, but our contractor staged the work so we could move in, and the crew became like family! It’s doable if you have fully functioning bathrooms and kitchen. Sweeten assisted throughout, from matching us with a contractor to providing a full bid review, and checking in about issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, we increased the scope of what we wanted to do significantly and our costs grew—but we got it all done in the</span><span class="s1"> range of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 to $150 per square foot</a>. Doing it simultaneously means that now we can enjoy our home and our time together as a multigenerational family. </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, Nadia and Stephen, for sharing your new home with us!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A renovation gives a design-obsessed owner the ultimate pad</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>For a lot of singles in New York City, a 500-square-foot Greenwich Village studio with both a lofted bedroom and an outdoor balcony would sound like a pie-in-the-sky find. But new homeowner Carly Schulte had a higher vision for this downtown co-op—she knew when she saw it that she could improve on it. She snapped up the apartment and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors. Here’s how Carly literally raised the lofty studio’s roof, with a Sweeten general contractor, making it a party-friendly place that feels larger than it really is.</i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-43375 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-living-room-3.jpg" alt="Greenwich Village Studio loft" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-living-room-3-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="img-label">  “After&#8221; photos by Pixy Interiors for Sweeten</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Carly</i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I was lucky in the apartment hunt. I’d only been to a handful of showings, but when I saw this place, I knew I wanted to make an offer. I have a soft spot for lofts, and the balcony made it a must-have. I’d been <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">planning—and saving—to buy</a> an apartment for years, and it was a good thing I waited. The sellers were motivated. I put in a bid and pulled off the purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d envisioned an overhaul that included renovating the kitchen and bathroom, modernizing the loft and stairs, and adding a giant wall-to-wall built-in of shelves and closets in the living room,</span><span class="s1"> but it was once I was there that I clarified my goals. I realized I wanted to expand the kitchen, since I love to cook; I needed a larger kitchen peninsula that would serve as both a work and eating surface. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="carly-against-black-accent-wall"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43379" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1.jpg" alt="photo of carly standing in front of a black accent wall after renovation" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Carly-portrait-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Although I left things like cabinet dimensions and stair specs to the professionals, I selected all the flooring, cabinets, [and other finishes].</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It dawned on me, too, that I wanted to raise the ceiling. One of the apartment’s previous owners had actually <i>dropped</i> it by at least five feet, wasting space and blocking light. In my mind, high ceilings are pretty much universally beloved and will definitely add value when I ultimately go to sell the apartment. I saw that by reclaiming the height, I could enclose the sleeping loft, allowing it to feel private but still be bright. I designed the windowed loft wall by looking through Instagram and showing the drawings to my Sweeten contractor. He found a way to make the enclosure with sliding glass panels that transmit both air and light.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew when I hired my contractor that I wanted to work this way, doing my own design work, and I was happy to find a contractor who would work with me. To say I was hands-on would be an understatement. Although I left cabinet and stair specs to the professionals, I handled most of the materials including the cabinets, tile, and appliances, as well as the layouts for each room (which was surprisingly time-consuming). </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When it came to aesthetics, I stayed neutral, particularly in more permanent elements like flooring and cabinetry. But I have a huge interest in texture, and I was excited about mixing flat, modern, cool elements, such as the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/stairs-that-are-a-real-design-treat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steel staircase</a> and black cabinetry [a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45662050/image/45662053/Deep-Dark">great way to create depth</a>], with warmer ones, like the wood-grain floors and golden-brown leather and upholstery. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To achieve the look I wanted, we had to do the work. It was a challenge, with bumps. The worst came early, when we demolished the kitchen and found asbestos. Remediation cost about $6,000 and added three months to the timeline. I would strongly recommend asbestos testing during the diligence phase to any potential buyer. Had I tested up-front and knocked some of the abatement costs off of the purchase price, I would have saved money.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">From start to finish, excluding the asbestos work, my renovation spanned five months. I moved out for several weeks when the contractor knocked down walls and raised the ceiling. For much of it, though, I was there. I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases and boxes. Luckily, my bedroom remained mostly untouched, so once the enclosure was finished, I spent my home time up there. I don’t regret slumming it. The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I heavily underestimated how long the approval process would take. The time it took just to obtain the co-op board’s approval for my plan was nearly six months. Staying in my rental apartment in hopes of a fast renovation was a big mistake. If I had it to do again, I would move in right after closing, live in my new space, and use that rent money for something meaningful. Hindsight is 20/20!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">People have asked how I lived through the project. I think I blocked some of it out, but I do remember leaning on the Sweeten team after a few long construction delays made me feel frustrated and uncertain. They offered me a sounding board and helped me adjust my expectations, and as a first-time renovator struggling to parse out the delays, their guidance was immensely helpful. When needed, Sweeten contacted my contractor and helped to keep things moving smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Despite the difficulties, I love the way the place turned out. The raised ceiling, now about 16 feet high, changed the entire feel of the place. The library ladder, a functional addition facilitating access to the high cupboards, added a fun touch, and the loft enclosure made the bedroom feel cozy and intimate. My new kitchen has made cooking every meal a pleasure, and even the bathroom is beautiful, which is rare to say about a bathroom. There was stress and sweat, sure. But designing the space was one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever worked on.</span></p>

<h3>Finding a dream-like duplex in the Upper East Side</h3>
<p>It takes just a word to sum up this family’s home-finding experience: miraculous. In the cosmopolitan stretches of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where even the parks are tiny and concrete-dipped, Jenn and Jon, six-year-old Elliott, two-year-old Abigail, and their Cockapoo, Zucca, found a place that can only have dropped out of a dream. The 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex in Yorkville, a tony area near the East River’s edge, was in a 1910 building a stone’s throw from Gracie Mansion, the New York City mayor’s residence.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43295 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Portrait-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43298" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg" alt="Duplex floor plan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-Before-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The story was that decades back, a former owner of the five-floor, then ten-unit building had combined three one-bedroom apartments to create a huge two-level residence with sole access to a sprawling rear garden. “W<span class="s1">e fell in love with the unbelievable backyard garden</span>,” said Jenn, the executive director of a family foundation, not to mention the amazing location. The problem was—and every Manhattan miracle has one—that the duplex needed renovation work.</p>
<p>From what Jenn and her partner, Jon, a lawyer at a bank, could see, little had been touched since the 1970s. The floors throughout were in poor condition. The white laminate kitchen was 40 years old and had an unfriendly layout. It was a daunting prospect for a couple with no construction experience, but before long, they were in contract. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/33394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their duplex renovation</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches renovators with vetted general contractors, hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their design-build firm</a>, and jumped in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43220" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg" alt="Stairs in a duplex renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Plotting the &#8220;must-haves&#8221; for the duplex renovation</h3>
<p>Jenn and Jon planned on four months for the duplex renovation. &#8216;Apartment is in good shape and does not need to be gutted,&#8217; they’d stated in their Sweeten post. “We knew we needed a full reno on the galley kitchen,” Jenn said, “but most everything else just needed a serious refresh.” Light updates were given to the 2.5 bathrooms including the master, the kids&#8217; bath, and a half bath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the “Must Do” list finalized, Jenn and Jon got to work with their Sweeten contractor’s design team. “We wanted a transitional-modern space that was light and airy,” Jenn said. “Our look, playing off of the brand-new white oak floors we were putting in and the existing black hardware like the stair rail and window frames, was ‘black, white, and wood.’” For inspiration, they followed the Instagram #BlackWhiteWood hashtag, which delivered great ideas.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Beginning in the kitchen, they got to work on what bothered them most: not old cabinetry, but two light-blocking openings that made the galley room feel closed off. The first was a partial wall between the eating area and the kitchen. The second, on the opposite end, was a too-small pocket door inhibiting flow to the living room. “The ground floor has only two natural light sources—the front kitchen window, which overlooks the street, and the garden door to the back—so this opening up was essential,” Jenn said.</p>
<p>By knocking out the divisive walls, they maximized light and flow, making the kitchen a focal point of their home and family life. “Having a well-laid-out space where we can cook and eat together as a family was one of our priorities,” Jenn said, “and we fulfilled it with everything from the new U-shaped eat-in banquette to the pantry, where huge pull-out drawers let the kids access their own snacks.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43297 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg" alt="living room leading to outdoors" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-08a-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) First-floor family room</em></span></p>
<p>In the kitchen and the apartment’s other rooms, Jenn and Jon selected materials in classic styles, like Shaker cabinets and five-panel doors, but finished with a modern flair. “We said no to crown molding,” Jenn said, “and kept the four-inch floorboards natural by sealing them with a white-infused stain.” As planned, they riffed off the existing black hardware, but mixed in metals, including brass light fixtures and stainless kitchen appliances, to relax the overall effect. They were stymied by the choices—working across so many rooms, they seemed endless. “It was hard making so many ‘permanent’ decisions over a short time,” Jenn said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43221" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11.jpg" alt="Stairs in a duplex" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #333333;">They soon realized they would have to install new white oak floors throughout, since the existing ones were stained, warped, or patched with cheap flooring that had been laid down years ago. (“They were mismatched, different heights, just an overall disaster,” Jenn said.) </span><span style="color: #333333;">The stairs and risers, however, were sanded and stained to match the new floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/creative-radiator-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">radiators worked</a>, but needed covers; the through-wall air conditioners screamed for an upgrade. The <a style="color: #333333;" href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets would get built-ins</a>, and the family needed more shelves, nooks, and stowaways up and down. New doors and molding would be necessary. Oh, and of course they would paint—everywhere.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43223" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-13.gif" alt="bedroom closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">A large bedroom on the second floor—that was once two separate rooms— would be divided again into two kids’ rooms complete with new closets in each. Their bathrooms, formerly a Jack-and-Jill with two entrances, had a wall built in turning them into two separate spaces once again. </span></p>
<p>“Jon was the one with the vision,” Jenn said. “We bought the apartment knowing it would need work to feel like our ‘forever home,’ but I was concerned going in about how much effort it would require.” They’d preferred a turnkey place but realized, having looked long and hard, that finding a comparable, renovated apartment they could afford, especially in such a prime location, would be near-impossible. And so, with a commitment to work together—because they’d heard too many stories of renovations tearing couples apart—they agreed to make it happen, in the name of a big, beautiful city home.</p>
<h3>Getting a hang of the renovation learning curve</h3>
<p>As first-time renovators, Jenn and Jon not only felt overwhelmed by the day-to-day, but knew little about <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgets, timeframes, or permits</a>. “We went in blind and had to learn fast!” Jenn said. <span class="s1">Because of this, and due to large last-minute changes to the plan—including an unforeseen full-frame exterior backdoor to the garden and brand new solid hardwood floors throughout—they exceeded their budget by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43217 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> <span class="img-label"> <em>(Above) Half bathroom</em></span></span></p>
<p>Still, Jenn said, it was worth it. “Our new home has significantly impacted our quality of life. The garden, where the kids can run free, is the biggest contributor to that, but a fabulous eat-in kitchen and two floors for stretching out are big assets, too,” she said. “To us, the place lives more like a house than an apartment—we are truly in love.”</p>

<h3>A home with potential</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s incredible what you can do to a house without knocking down a wall. We had to look beyond a lot of challenges, 40-year-old decor, </span><span class="s1">an antiquated electrical system, and thin, stained wooden floors. But we saw something we could work with.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42954 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg" alt="renovators on couch with dogs" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43007 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg" alt="exterior 1920s house remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyli-Exterior-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house had a great layout. We loved the open first floor, with its nine-and-a-half-foot ceilings and perfect flow—the foyer, living room, and dining room were all open but the spaces were distinct. The second floor lacked overhead lighting and had wood paneling in every room, but was accessed by a beautiful staircase. Potential! We knew we could make it modern while preserving its ‘20s spirit.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42944 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg" alt="Black double French doors, living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Double-french-doors-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42945 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg" alt="remodeled foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Entryway-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Hidden architectural designs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not that it would be easy. The family we bought the house from had owned it for 34 years and it had a very retro feel. We hoped that the layers of carpet and wallpaper might conceal architectural delights, but were disappointed that the few special details we uncovered, like parquet inlays, were beyond salvaging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We knew that foundational work would eat most of the budget, with the floors and walls requiring considerable attention.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initial scope that we listed out for Sweeten offered a basic overview of our project, listing last: “</span><span class="s3">Inspect/clean electrical panel.” We mentioned the possible need to replace or expand it, but didn’t realize how much work it would actually require. Finding out that we needed to replace all of the wiring</span><span class="s1"> was one surprise that our renovation served up. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We scheduled walk-thoughs to see the work at various stages, including&#8230;the electrical portion. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42951 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg" alt="living room renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Living-Room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combining the old with new</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We didn’t move or remove a single wall but we did add French doors in the foyer to create a barrier to summer heat and winter cold. Because most of the first floor is open concept, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interior doors help to keep</a> the temperature even and comfortable year-round, while also creating a dramatic entry into our living space. [See more <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/home/photo-gallery/45749027/image/45749041/Modern-Meets-Country">inspiring living rooms here</a>.]</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">One of our goals was to build in details that appeared original. Where we could, we blended the old with the new that included a molding update. We complemented the existing molding on the stairs with new molding on the adjacent wall. </span><span class="s1">Our contractor matched the living room ceiling to the dining room’s original trim and a ceiling medallion was installed, a hint at deco design. It was in this room that the house finally gave us a gift. Our contractor unearthed a window hidden inside the dining room exterior wall—a lovely find that, with some attention, brought us a lot more light.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="dining room remodeled" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Choosing the materials</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We stripped, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coated</a>, and painted the walls and redid two bathrooms investing in materials that would last. New floors were installed, windows were repaired, and energy-efficient ductless AC went throughout the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house felt instantly spacious and bright. The two things we were looking for in every choice we made: quality and classic style. From flooring and tiles to paint and different types of fixtures, we chose finishes we knew would last and look good for decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our color scheme, like everything else, is stark, graphic, and, most importantly, bright. White with the occasional swath of black feels timeless and pulls together everything from the foyer to the upstairs bath. A discreet beach vibe is there for those who look—low-key seashell references are hidden in a few small spots, a nod to the fact that we&#8217;re a 25-minute walk from Marine Park.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42955 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg" alt="Staircase remodel" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Staircase-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting things done to code</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We wound up doing nearly twice as much work and extending our schedule to four times the original plan. We spent a little over $120,000, including materials, a four-month apartment rental, and contractor costs. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We were scrupulous about everything being done to code. Our Sweeten contractor had great communication skills and sent updates, photos, and videos via WhatsApp. We scheduled walk-throughs to see the work at various stages, including the point when the electrical portion was complete. Seeing exactly what had been done before the walls were closed up was informative and reassuring. As a civil engineer, Luke was heavily focused on ensuring that the electrical, plumbing, and structural elements were sound.</span></p>

<h3>An extensive renovation</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This renovation taught us a lot! It wasn’t our first experience, but our biggest by far. We used many subcontractors, including electricians, HVAC specialists, plumbers, hardwood flooring installers, and plaster experts, and asked a lot of questions about the best processes, the ideal order for tasks, and how to complete them on a reasonable schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best part of the renovation? Seeing the “after” months later, after being so overwhelmed by the “before”! We didn’t gut the house, but we came close. The difference is dramatic. We are absolutely thrilled.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>If you want to have your way with a New York City apartment, “handyman special” is the phrase to look for in the listings. And that’s exactly what our discreet homeowners—we’ll call them MR and SV—found when they walked into this one-bedroom Kew Gardens, Queens co-op. The 1,000-square-foot unit was chock full of prewar features, but would make way for a clean and modern look focusing on the kitchen and bathroom. The renovators <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/34618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> who elevated an outdated apartment into the 21st century, on a budget to boot.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My wife, SV, and I purchased a co-op in a nice prewar building, where it looked like nothing had changed since the doors opened in 1939. Having renovated our previous Brooklyn co-op, we had some experience. We had no intention of turning this vintage one-bedroom into a jet-age European fantasy apartment that would look laughable in less than a year. Still, every inch of the interior, with the exception of the windows, which are the property of the co-op itself, needed work. We had a draftsman and architect draw up plans. </span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Meanwhile, our Sweeten bids came in; we interviewed four contractors and agreed on one. </span><span class="s1">We’d written in our project profile that we were looking for complete renovations of both the kitchen and bathroom. We’d stated upfront that we intended to source all of the appliances, cabinets, fixtures, and flooring ourselves. In the interest of full disclosure, I also wrote: “Please be aware that there are both cosmetic and structural alterations involved that will require meeting the co-op building&#8217;s management requirements and any DOB requirements.” I prefer to head off surprises whenever possible. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We began by gutting the kitchen. In addition to the cabinets and appliances, we removed the 1930s-era architectural elements including an arch and ripped out the dated kitchen door and its frame. The floor was covered in linoleum tiles. Out! Our contractor put down new </span><span class="s3">ceramic floor tiles</span><span class="s1"> and white </span><span class="s3">subway tiles</span><span class="s1"> as a backsplash for our gray-grained cabinets. The six-burner gas range was a splurge, but we did everything else clean and spare. </span><span class="s4">With proper electrical updating, we even managed a dishwasher in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">We gutted the bathroom next, in the end deciding to refinish the bathtub rather than replace it with the stand-up shower we’d planned. </span><span class="s1">SV decided on wall tiles with a beveled edge and a wispy smoke pattern. For the floor, crosshatch floor tiles were laid down in a chevron design. With input from our contractor, a glass-paneled barn-style door mounted on a track was installed which saves space in the bathroom and hallway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our contractor stripped and stained all of the original parquet wood floors in the living areas. </span><span class="s1">We also installed smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During every new phase, our upstanding Sweeten contractor looked at our plans, went over the steps necessary, and helped me answer questions from the building management company’s construction engineer. </span><span class="s1">SV and I grilled our contractor before we began, so we knew what we were getting into. He gave us a contract including a price and an exhaustive list of the work he’d be responsible for. He stood by the price and the work, re-negotiating our agreement only as changes came up. Whenever I had questions, I was able to contact him or his office manager. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We purchased most of the materials and ran each item by our contractor, I got a thumb’s up or an explanation for why something wouldn&#8217;t work. </span><span class="s1">I made it my business to be at the job site daily. I knew enough to stay out of the way of the workers and, if necessary, to sweep up or run out to get coffee for the crew.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We suffered a few stops and starts, primarily due to disagreements with the co-op’s management over construction elements. </span><span class="s1">Did everything come out according to plan? Look at the photos and you decide. I’d write more, but SV wants me to install a wall-mounted broom rack. We’re getting a little closer to finished every day. And we love this old place. Especially now that it’s brand new.</span></p>
