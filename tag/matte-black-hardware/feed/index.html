</ul>
<p><em>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowners</em></p>
<h3>West Coast natives find a new home</h3>
<p>California natives, Tom and Alex, purchased an 880-square-foot apartment in Brooklyn after renting in Manhattan and Los Angeles. They were drawn to the unique history of the Clinton Hill Co-ops built in 1941 by the U.S. Navy as housing for workers at the then-bustling Navy Yard. They bought a unit on the second floor that hadn’t been renovated since the mid-&#8217;80s.</p>

<p>It had the original parquet floors, faux-granite Formica countertops, and a badly-configured floor plan that wasted valuable space. While the non-functional kitchen/dining space was the reason for the project, by the end, every wall, ceiling, and flooring had been either gutted or resurfaced.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-26.jpg" alt="living room with slatted room divider" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-18-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century apartment" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-25.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century apartment" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-25-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century apartment" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Tom, a Brooklyn real estate agent, knew that a more functional, ergonomic space with better flow and storage could be achieved. For their own apartment remodel, the project enlisted Sweeten homeowners and also designers Casey and Kumar of <a href="https://www.studiomilleratre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studio Miller Atre</a> for a conceptual design that matched their lifestyle and design taste. Their Sweeten contractor, along with their architect, David, completed the professional team.</p>
<p>Casey and Kumar established a mix of materials that would include the mid-century decor they loved. Throughout the home, original art from family members, Braniff International Airways collectibles from the &#8217;60s, and textiles from designer Alexander Girard personalized the space.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Not only did it feel like 300 square feet was added to the apartment but realized after this project was complete that it was worth every single penny.”
</p></blockquote>

<h3>Living room and kitchen—separate but unified</h3>
<p>Since the dining/kitchen area opened directly into the living room, a partition was created to allow for visual flow while defining the two spaces. Vertical, floor-to-ceiling walnut slats complemented the surrounding mid-century decor. The wood slats would tie the walnut seen in both rooms—the kitchen cabinets and floating walnut decorative wall panel in the living room.</p>
<p>A favorite purchase was a modular Vitsoe 606 unit that became their workspace in the living room. “It was designed by German industrial designer Dieter Rams, and first produced by Vitsoe in Denmark in 1961,&#8221; said Alex. &#8220;We were looking for a simple, highly flexible desk/wall unit that also looked really good.”</p>
<p>In the dining area, the designers dropped the ceiling by five inches to install wiring for the dining room pendant and a recessed light dimming system. The outdated electrical system was often overloaded by modern-day appliances. A new electrical panel supported heavier usage. More electrical outlets were added in convenient locations throughout the apartment.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-09-10.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="mid-century kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-12-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century kitchen" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Bringing the kitchen up-to-speed</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seen through the walnut slats, the kitchen’s white-and-walnut theme was offset by a geometric <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/kitchen-backsplash-materials-for-your-kitchen-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile backsplash</a> and quartz countertops. Matte black hardware provided simple, linear contrast while wooden pendants added warmth. The dishwasher and sink were moved to more logical locations, while full-height uppers and the wall of cabinets surrounding the refrigerator provide ample storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the new island, there are deep pull-out drawers for pots and pans, as well as integrated plastic bins for trash and recycling, making it simple to wipe crumbs and other debris from the island directly into the trash can. The extra countertop surface allows multiple people to work in the kitchen at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="mid-century bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="mid-century bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="mid-century bathroom" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>A multi-textural bathroom</h3>
<p>In the bathroom, the bathtub was converted to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/">walk-in shower</a> with a large, sliding glass door. A pedestal sink replaced a vanity with storage. The walnut, white, and black palette anchored by a bold leafy wallpaper along one wall lends a luxurious feel. They also indulged in a washlet toilet, with a heated seat and dryer.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century bedroom" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="mid-century bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Tom_Apartment-02-723x482.jpg" alt="mid-century bedroom" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>A functional bedroom with mid-century decor</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the bedroom received a refresh. Closet doors went all the way to the ceiling, powder-coated wire shelving was added, and automatic lights were installed—a “game-changer,” said Tom. Behind the headboard, the couple pulled in a textured grasscloth wallpaper at Casey’s suggestion. “She brought us countless options for material choices we never would have considered on our own,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Her solid design instincts allowed her to really tune into our personal tastes and preferences.” A Braniff Boeing 707 model, built from a plastic kit, now hangs from the ceiling in the bedroom.</p>
<h3>The renovation process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor was the perfect choice for executing their vision—in personality, budget, and in his attention to detail. “His team was brilliant in their execution of Casey and Kumar’s design concept. He was always available when we needed to work something out, and consistently offered the solutions we required. The quality and finish of the work are both top-notch,” Alex shared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking back, the homeowners share that the most difficult issue about the renovation was “wrapping our heads around spending bigger sums of money. Neither of us had been through this process before, and there was a certain trepidation even after we had committed to construction.” They were, however, able to finance the project with equity that they had built since owning the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And as a real estate agent, Tom knew that the substantial increase in the apartment’s resale value justified the overall cost. “In the end, we reminded ourselves that we are both staunchly home-centric people who place a great deal of value on the comfort and serenity that only a beautiful, functional home can give us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not only did it feel like 300 square feet was added to the apartment but realized after this project was complete that it was worth every single penny.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two newlyweds came to Sweeten for help finding a general contractor with design expertise to update and brighten their two-bedroom co-op on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Read on down to see a classically sweetened kitchen, master bath, and powder room!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20220" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantages of this couple&#8217;s new place were very clear: beamed ceilings and big windows in every room brought lovely natural light throughout the unit, and original hardwood floors lent a relaxed look to the space. The kitchen, visible from the foyer, dining room, and living room, had two gracious windows but was outfitted with miniature appliances, isolated blocks of cabinets, and dark finishes. And while the kitchen and both bathrooms had been treated to some relatively recent updates, this couple saw potential for modern features and additions that would help them get settled. With the closing officially on the books, </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple posted their project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten, calling for a designer and builder who could help them make the most of the square footage in the kitchen and bathrooms before moving in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>matched them with a Sweeten design-build firm</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Together, they devised a plan to create a more spacious and bright kitchen and newly updated baths with elegant finishes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18737"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18737 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_mila_kitchen-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-Before-01-1-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractors began with the kitchen, gutting the space entirely. The apartment’s oak floors were worn, but the telltale parquet plank details and inlaid borders were enough to convince the team to leave them in place, restore them, and extend them into the kitchen, replacing the section of pine flooring that had made its way in during a previous renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This design-build firm specializes in custom millwork and brought a signature white shaker look to this couple’s kitchen. They went minimal in the most visible places, limiting full cabinet lines to one wall, adding a bit of open shelving to the windowed wall, and significantly extending base cabinets around the back wall of the dining nook. These design decisions aimed for maximum light and an open feel. They tore out the windowsill just to the left of the dining nook to make way for that additional counter and cabinet space, and finished the full set with contrasting black knobs and sturdy pulls. The old black stone counters were replaced with white and soft gray quartz, blending the new white and black combo seamlessly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowners were keen on replacing their compact oven and dishwasher with full-size versions, so the pair gained a sleek new Verona gas range with an exhaust hood fashioned with custom oak shelves on either side, stained to match the new floors. A full size Bosch dishwasher took the place of the old, just to the left of the stove and concealed behind coordinating cabinetry panels. The couple chose a large white Kohler farmhouse sink and chrome Moen faucet, situated nicely under the far window. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new stainless steel double-door fridge is now flanked by custom pantry storage, and the Sweeten contractor pulled the entire update together with a simple beveled white marble backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-05-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18729"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18729" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-05-1.jpg" alt="white marble backsplash" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-05-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18730"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18730 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg" alt="kohler farmhouse sink" width="600" height="903" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-06-1-598x900.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like the kitchen, the homeowners wanted cosmetic changes to both bathrooms to reveal more of their personal style and taste, favoring neutral colors and patterns and aiming for a brighter, cleaner feel. Nothing too extravagant, too old, or too contemporary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They decided on simple geometric shapes and a natural palette in both. The master bath received a full gut without changing the footprint. Cloudy square floor tiles were tossed and delicate carrara marble pieces in soft bluish grays went down. The old shower/tub combo was of average height and size and contained very basic hardware. The couple chose a deep cast-iron Soissons Kohler bath with multiple Rohl hardware fixtures in a gorgeous muted polished nickel. A dark wood vanity sink originally stood to the left of the tub but was replaced with a much lighter wood finish with twice the storage space. A chic square mirror with an antiqued bevel stands over it, and new Kohler toilets were added in both bathrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, the same cloudy square floor tiles were replaced with a herringbone tile in soft gray and white, while the same square wall tiles were swapped for a subway style in white marble. The homeowners selected a slender dark wood vanity and square white porcelain sink, along with a silhouette mirror trimmed in wood to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The general contractors sanded and stained the oak wood floors throughout the rest of the apartment, and in doing so they replaced all of the white shoe molding as well. The walls were stripped and repainted, mostly white or the palest gray-blue found in the new powder room.</p>
