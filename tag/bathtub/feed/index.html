<h3 class="p5">Living with a yesteryear Philadelphia bathroom</h3>
<p><i>Tiny pink south Philly row home bathroom needs a complete renovation,</i> our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> project post read. We attached photos, featuring not only the Pepto-toned tiles, but teal-colored rugs and seashell wallpaper. They’d been photographed three years earlier, but little had changed—proof that the project was way overdue. The bathroom hadn’t been renovated since the home was built in 1920.</p>
<p class="p6"><i><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sweeten homeowners" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></i></p>
<p class="p6">We’re Kait and Patrick, former renters who jumped to buy a fixer-upper as we watched housing prices tick up in our ideal Philadelphia neighborhoods. When we purchased our 1,400-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/what-to-know-when-remodeling-a-philadelphia-rowhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">row house in the southern Point Breeze/Newbold</a> area a few years ago, we completed renovations including laying new floors, adding central air, skim-coating and painting the walls, and installing a new kitchen. But we didn’t have the budget to renovate the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Learning from past renovations</h3>
<p class="p6">As anyone can see, the bathroom was ugly. The floor tile didn’t coordinate with the walls. Everything was old and stained; no amount of cleaning made it look presentable. But it was our only bathroom (unless you count the creepy basement toilet and slop sink). When the time came to remodel it, our immediate priorities were practical: finding a contractor who could complete the project in a reasonable amount of time and without sacrificing the quality of materials or workmanship.</p>
<p class="p6"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg" alt="Split images of the bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52404" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-Before-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p6">Then there was the goal: To create something that would feel like a sanctuary. With that vision in mind, we put a lot of effort into interviewing contractors who responded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/86002#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten project posting</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6178#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>. In our last renovation, honestly, we had terrible experiences. Like with the contractor who demolished our kitchen so prematurely that we lived without a kitchen for eight months. We were determined to prevent another debacle like that.</p>
<p class="p6">The bathroom was chaotic and we lived with it for a long time, but the chance to improve it came sooner than expected. After twice canceling our wedding due to Covid, we eloped and put the money saved towards the bathroom project. Our families and friends were generous with wedding gifts, further helping us fund the job.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">The small-spaced bathroom stays small</h3>
<p class="p6">From the first planning phases, we knew we would have no layout changes. We didn’t want to expand into any of the bedrooms, so we agreed that the bathroom would remain really small. We set out to use every inch.</p>
<p class="p6">Making the bathroom functional—versus crammed—meant we had to be intentional with the size of everything. The original bathtub was designed for shorter people, so finding one that could fit my 6’3” husband was a must, and we eventually did. We chose a trim toilet and a vanity that is narrow, but offers storage. We opted for a barn door-style glass shower enclosure to let the light flow through and open up the space.</p>
<p class="p6"><b><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Vanity and mirror with bronze hardware" width="1000" height="1501" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/86002-Kaitlin-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></b></p>
<h3 class="p6">Choosing neutral with a pop</h3>
<p class="p6">We also achieved a visual openness with color, or lack of it. We used a lot of bold hues in the rest of our house; we wanted this to be a departure from that, so we went with gray and white. But with this neutral tile choice, we started to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-splash-a-bath-with-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worry that the bathroom would be boring</a>—even if it did feel bigger, and calmer. We added the gold fixtures to give it a luxe feel. The pink paint is a sort of homage to the old bathroom.</p>
<h3 class="p6">The right renovation team</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, our Sweeten contractor gave honest recommendations and feedback. He was straightforward about what tile and fixtures would work best and be most durable. We received a lot of check-ins from Sweeten as the project progressed; it was helpful to know we had extra support if we needed it.</p>

<p class="p6">We love the result. The super deep soaking tub is amazing and was absolutely worth the money. I love that, unlike with the previous bathroom, I’m not aggravated by the decor when I walk in. Long overdue indeed. We’re so happy we made the most of nearly two tough years and turned this bathroom into a peaceful haven we both love.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom remodel “must-haves”</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our home is a wood-frame row house in Jersey City, New Jersey. It’s 150 years old, has three floors, and 1,000 square feet. </span><span class="s1">When we first visited the house more than five years ago, I fell in love with the main bathroom’s vintage mint-green bathtub. I knew I wanted to preserve it. </span></p>

</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our home is historic, but over the years and through many renovations, most of its charm had been lost. T</span><span class="s2">he house’s two bathrooms are “newer”—added at some point onto the back of the house. The one we wanted to update is on the second floor, off of the primary bedroom. </span><span class="s1">It’s our only full bathroom. </span><span class="s3">We didn’t want to change the floor plan, but had a goal of</span><span class="s1"> modernizing while injecting a vintage feel. We planned to do this by</span><span class="s3"> keeping the original tub and adding a period medicine cabinet we’d found. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our second goal was to make the room warmer.

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Staying home during the remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We embarked on the bathroom renovation last summer. Our household—two adults and two cats—had</span><span class="s1"> been working from home since the pandemic began in March 2020. My partner and I are handy and we’ve done many projects ourselves, including tile work, sheetrock, trim, carpentry, and minor plumbing and electrical work. We have a good sense of how things should be done, but we didn’t have the personal bandwidth <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/diy-vs-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to complete this project ourselves</a>. Luckily, the lockdown gave us the flexibility to have our only full bathroom out of commission. We would not have a shower during the bathroom renovation, but we had a backyard with a hose! </span><span class="s4">We would prioritize our bathtub and shower update, then move to the rest of the bathroom. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Style sparks inspiration for the vintage bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> post, we mentioned the mint-green bathtub and our desire to work with it. We wanted the tub to feel intentional in the space, rather than something that was left there because it was too heavy or too expensive to get rid of. To make the room feel more “classic,” we wanted to introduce vintage elements, but merge them with a modern design. Posting our project on Sweeten made it possible for us to “take the plunge.” We were hesitant about hiring a contractor, but Sweeten gave us confidence, knowing we wouldn’t be going it alone.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Improving the bathroom layout</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As planned, we did not change the bathroom layout, but some demolition discoveries influenced the project. </span><span class="s5">We found remnants of original pastel pink tiles near the tub—but while the color combination was classic in the bathroom’s era, we decided not to go so bold. With</span><span class="s1"> the walls down, we saw that we not only needed additional insulation behind the new sheetrock but in the ceiling as well. We also noticed that the ceiling near the door had been dropped by several feet. Pulling it down and replacing it offered an opportunity to open and visually enlarge the space. This nice surprise changed the whole feeling of the room.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Picking bathroom tiles</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding modern tiles that seemed true to the historic nature of the house, but that would also play well with the tub, wasn’t easy. Matching tile to vintage mint-green porcelain is impossible, and coordinating colors—other than neutrals—are limited. We’d first selected a different floor tile, also with a green marble effect, but when we tried to order, it was no longer available. We’d already chosen a project start date so we scrambled to find a replacement. Fortunately, we found this mosaic polished stone tile. It was <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more expensive than our original pick</a>, which gave us pause, but we needed to move forward. I love how it complements the tub.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor used inspirational photos and sketched the design for the inlaid black pencil tile. He then executed it beautifully and it came out exactly as we’d hoped. The white wall tile has a vintage vibe but is simpler, allowing the tub and floor tile to shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Design ideas: old and new</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We chose this vanity in part because it was larger than our prior one, and has drawers. Our little old house is tight on storage, so it was important to maximize the vanity’s potential. I like the legs—it resembles furniture and lets the floor tiles show. We’d come across t</span><span class="s6">he </span><span class="s1">chrome medicine cabinet with lights at an antique shop and saved it until we were ready to start. Its curves are wonderful, as are the inner glass shelves, which are still intact. The mirror’s silvering has imperfections, but that adds to the charm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My favorite aspects of the vintage (but still modern!) bathroom remodel are the high ceiling and floor tile. I had been planning the renovation for several years, and during that time I had collected probably 15 different floor- and wall-tile combinations. Ultimately, I was glad we took a few years to decide what we wanted and to find the right pieces. And I still love the green tub.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Working with the right renovation partner</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the very beginning, our Sweeten contractor responded to the issues and questions we raised and collaborated with us in the design process. He helped us plan out what materials we needed and told us when we would need them, helping us to avoid scrambles and delays. It never felt like our input was creating a problem, or that we were being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was no avoiding the fact that we were living in a tiny construction zone but our contractor and his crew made it as painless as possible. It was great to see the time and effort they put into clean-up each day. We’re both extremely happy with the end result.</span></p>

<h3>Keeping their Jackson Heights remodel in view<span>—for years</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We purchased our co-op roughly three years before embarking on the renovation. Our goal was to totally revamp the apartment into open-plan spaces, while preserving its period features. Like many pre-war homes, it had a lot of small rooms. I think our result is proof that, even if there’s no perfect moment to remodel, intensive planning pays off.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Keeping historic details</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The 1,400-square-foot unit is located in a 1921 historical-district co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens. The place hadn’t been touched since the 1970s and was in rough shape. But there were nice original details, like beautiful wood floors with inlaid borders and a period fireplace. It needed a significant overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dia and I didn’t rush it. We’d rented in the neighborhood for a couple of years to make sure we liked the area—and we did. After finding the co-op, we wanted to take our time and put our stamp on it. We spent almost two years planning the remodel. By the time we were ready to proceed, Dia was pregnant with our daughter, Madeleine. We were eager to get the job done, and ready to pick up the pace. </span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">In-depth research and planning </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/50730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten. We made clear in our overview that we were ready to obtain our co-op board approvals, navigate the permitting, order materials, and get started. By then we’d spent a lot of time planning the layout, materials, and finishes. We had 40 pages of diagrams, renderings, and materials lists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Five or six Sweeten contractors came for site visits and gave us estimates. Right away, one stood out. He had printed out our mammoth set of plans (which he jokingly referred to as “the bible”), came armed with excellent questions, spoke knowledgeably about what would and would not be possible given NYC building codes, and gave us a detailed and reasonable estimate. We knew immediately that <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we wanted to hire him</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">A gut remodel with an extensive to-do list </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Going in, we made sure the contractor understood that we had a specific vision, and that we were demanding. We planned to open the kitchen, living, and dining rooms, build a modern kitchen, renovate both bathrooms to spa standards, and add closet space. At the same time, we intended to keep original details, and even increase them by adding period chandeliers and other fixtures that would complement the co-op’s 1920s style.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Our renovation scope was specific. It included replacing and relocating the breaker box, and installing new switches and sockets. We wanted to remove several unnecessary walls, and rebuild two walls and two water-damaged window encasements. We requested new baseboards and crown moldings. In the kitchen, we <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to add a peninsula</a>, a custom pantry, and a sideboard. We wanted to build closets in the bedrooms and entryway, as well as custom cabinets and radiator covers. We’d paint every room and refinish the floors.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Problem solving with the general contractor team</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Several miracles occurred in the kitchen. When we removed a wall to make way for the new peninsula, it resulted in a break in the floor inlay, but the floor subcontractor recreated the </span><span class="s2">multi-wood pattern so skillfully that you can’t tell what is original and what is new. Our appliance vendor’s repeated delivery delays caused a need for our countertops to be installed before the appliances. Our Sweeten contractor got them in when they arrived, despite incredible difficulty—installing our refrigerator even required removing the baseboard temporarily.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When our single-piece sideboard countertop was too big for the elevator, the guys carried them up five flights of stairs. And when the new electrical box occupied the former microwave place, the cabinetmaker came up with a built-in pantry, designed with an interior cutout to fit the oven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In our bathroom, we had other inspired solutions. We wanted to move the toilet but a steel beam prevented placement in the new rough-in location. Our contractor proposed a wall-hung toilet that freed up space for it to stay in the original location and squeezed in a vanity, which wasn’t possible with the traditional commode. Thanks to supply-chain disruptions during Covid-19, we ended up sourcing bathroom tile other than that from our original wishlist—and the manufacturer offered no coordinating trim. Our general contractor found a trim that matched and drove more than 700 miles to collect every piece they could find.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s2">Homeowners share their renovation advice</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">As first-time renovators, our biggest questions from the beginning were about how to manage the many subcontractors and aspects of the work happening simultaneously. But our Sweeten contractor pulled it all together. Our initial instincts about planning carefully were validated, but the process also taught us to always have a Plan B. We certainly learned the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/sweeten-renovator-reviews-10-things-they-loved-about-their-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">value of picking the right contractor</a>—one who inspires confidence and keeps your best interests at heart.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s2">We couldn’t have asked for a more professional and dedicated team. At the start, he helped us gather the necessary co-op board sign-offs and connected us with an architect. He managed the permitting process seamlessly, despite NYC Department of Buildings changes during Covid-19. At every step, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our general contractor</a> went above and beyond to help us realize our vision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I’m not sure anyone comes in under budget in a renovation. We didn’t, but we stayed </span><span class="s2">roughly in line with our expectations. There was a payoff, in any case. Our beautiful result! Even having done the project six months after having our baby and during a pandemic, we feel peaceful. We are in love with our home.</span></p>

<li><strong>Homeowners:</strong> A young couple <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their Bed-Stuy remodel</a> on Sweeten to revitalize their townhouse</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Outfit their 1,500-square-foot Bed-Stuy home with a new kitchen, bath, and open-concept living area</li>
<li><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Sweeten&#8217;s role:</strong> <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reimagining the Bed-Stuy home for family life</h3>
<p>This Bedford-Stuyvesant home once belonged to the homeowner&#8217;s grandmother. The home came with fond memories of her childhood, so she happily inherited it. However, as the townhouse had been built in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, it needed a lot of work. She would remodel it to accommodate the needs of her own family. They planned for an open concept layout, with open sightlines to keep the family together while in different rooms. To modernize the spaces, they&#8217;d outfit their dream kitchen and bathroom with new, state-of-the-art appliances and finishes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg" alt="Exterior of the Bed-Stuy home with front yard and metal gate" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27287-Teresa-Apt-01-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>She turned to Sweeten to find a contractor she&#8217;d be comfortable with handling this important renovation. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27287#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted her project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4715#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the right contractor</a> with experience in old-home remodels. They signed the contract and the work began!</p>
<h3>Necessary behind-the-wall updates</h3>
<p>First, fixing the systems behind the walls had to be done to support updated materials and appliances. The plumbing had corroded and was located in inefficient places. The electrical also needed to be upgraded. Their Sweeten contractor found improperly connected wires in the ceiling, which posed a fire hazard. The subfloor had to be ripped out, and the joists had to be reinforced to keep the kitchen floor from collapsing.</p>

<p>All this work made the kitchen functional and safe. The design aesthetic came next. The homeowner chose a contemporary combination of white cabinets along the kitchen perimeter, and gray base cabinets for the island. The owners selected quartz countertops for the work surface, due to their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/popular-types-of-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reasonable price point and durability</a>. The island became the focal point of the room, which also featured deliberate pops of color, like the must-have bright red range. Other features, such as a gold-finish pot filler, pull-out storage cabinets, and a built-in wine rack, completed the look.</p>
<h3>New layout and features</h3>
<p>The rest of the Bed-Stuy home benefited from the remodel, too. Their contractor removed a wall between the kitchen and living area to open up the flow. They also installed new wood floors, along with all-new recessed lights, a closet, and a front door. Another addition: a new laundry room, which replaced an existing screened-in porch area. The contractor fully outfitted the laundry room—from reconstructing electrical, plumbing, and insulation to subflooring and venting.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the master bathroom</h3>
<p>Like the kitchen, the master bathroom would become her dream bathroom. As a mom, it would be her sanctuary. A standalone tub would give her the chance to unwind. The construction crew faced a challenge: nestling the tub into a tight niche without damaging or touching the walls. But the crew completed the task handily, with the result being an inviting clawfoot oasis, flanked on one end by a custom vanity. In a nod to wainscoting, the team <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-much-does-it-cost-to-tile-a-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed the bathroom tile</a> halfway up the wall.</p>

<h3>Working with the right contractor</h3>
<p>For this nostalgic renovation, the homeowner saw and worked with her Sweeten contractor for months. Fortunately, she found the right partner who understood her vision. This partnership allowed them to communicate throughout the process and solve problems when issues arose. A solid working bond between the client and Sweeten contractor formed, so much so, when it looked like their renovation would not be done in time for Thanksgiving, their contractor invited them to celebrate with his family. Luckily, their new home is now ready to create brand new memories for years to come.</p>

<p class="p2">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowners Ylia + André&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/fixer-upper-washington-heights-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tub-to-shower conversion</a></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Deciding whether to convert a bathtub into a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bathtubs have their place, but most of us take many more showers than baths. So why were most bathrooms outfitted with a bathtub rather than a walk-in shower over the last few decades? The simplest answer is flexibility. You can take a shower in a bathtub, but not vice-versa. Also, families with children do well with a bathtub, and they’re useful for bathing dogs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, stepping over the tub rail every time you shower is not ideal, and is not possible for many people. If you&#8217;re ready for a change, this guide by Sweeten lays out how to convert a bathtub to a shower (luckily, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward!)</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Showers are ideal for aging and multi-generational families</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Converting a bathtub into a shower has become much more common as our population ages, aided by the increasing popularity of accessible and<a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> universal design</a>. These design concepts are aligned with the Americans with Disabilities Act and include features such as entry ramps in place of stairs, rocker-style light switches, and lever-style door handles in place of knobs. The magic of this approach, even when not mandated, is obvious with multigenerational families, or when you find yourself with an injury or chronic health condition. These thoughtful home designs can accommodate your needs however they may change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a bathroom remodel, the shower can use a curbless entrance that doesn’t impede a wheelchair user. (Another benefit of the curbless design is its streamlined, modern look!) Another popular feature y</span><span class="s1">ou can specify is a built-in or removable bench. Even better, there is a multitude of design and hardware options to add these elements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="light-tiled-bathroom-with-mirror" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg" alt="light tiled bathroom with large mirror and shower glass for walk in shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-35033 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marie-Niarhos-BathKitchen-19-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Figure out if a shower will work for you</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before ordering materials and fixtures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post your project</a> on Sweeten and discuss with your contractor whether your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">Create an overall plan that includes the finished size of the shower, location of existing or desired windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of existing plumbing. If the shower drain stays in the same location, the connection is simple and fast. If the drain must be moved, you’ll see the cost rise, depending on how extensive the work is. Items like the faucet and showerhead will come in later. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Materials for converting a shower</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the shower unit itself, you can choose a good-quality pre-formed pan and walls, but high-quality tiled pans and walls have become prevalent and usually have a better “feel.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom tiles</a> are also one of, if not the most, powerful <span class="s3">aesthetic statements in the room</span>. This is where you can really get creative. Ceramic, glass, stone, and even metal tiles are available in any color, multiple textures, and finishes. You can truly have any look you love with tiles, and apart from normal cleaning and sealing, their maintenance is low.</span></p>
<h3>Costs to convert a bathtub to a shower</h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Costs to convert a bathtub into a shower are usually quite reasonable. If you’re starting with a bathroom that’s in good condition, you can plan for $1,500 or so for a quick and basic conversion. If you upgrade to a tile pan and walls, you’ll be looking at $3,000 and up. These figures are for standard materials. However, when you make changes to the room size, or add windows that require new framing, your costs will increase. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="white-and-brown-bathroom-with-floating-vanity" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13.jpg" alt="White and brown bathroom with floating vanity and shower curtain after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-51551 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN-Megan-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h4>Costs for faucets and showerheads</h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Faucets and showerheads are available in countless styles and finishes, and you’re probably aware of rainfall showerheads. Full-body jets are another popular and luxurious feature, but definitely are considered an extra. Good faucets will cost $100 and up and they’re worth every penny.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One item you mustn’t overlook is the shower door system. You’ll find clear glass, frosted glass, and so on, but the aesthetics are less important than the quality. Like the shower pan, the door keeps the water where it belongs and should seal completely. A tiny leak, unnoticed for five years, is a disaster in the making. Fortunately, you can prevent this scenario easily with a high-quality door system installed by your contractor. A good unit will cost you $500 and up, depending on the size you need.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A remodeling team to guide your bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just like kitchens, bathroom remodels can be more complex than other rooms. This is due to their heavy, daily usage and the requirement for more fixtures in a small space. Toilet, sink, shower, and storage all have to be integrated into one of the smallest rooms in the house. That’s where interior designers and general contractors shine. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find the right general contractor</a> to help you navigate these decisions. </span></p>

Once you have a plan in place, you can order materials.</span></p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">These 7 modern bathroom designs by Sweeten homeowners show off a wide range of inspiration</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with white marble and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;">Modern bathroom designs can be sleek or warm. (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span class="s3">Lexi&#8217;s minimalist bathroom renovation</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3>A fresh version of modern</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you think of a modern classic bathroom, images of white tile accented with contemporary fixtures come to mind. This vision is true but the design palette can also stretch beyond that. Texture, tone, shape, and color all contribute to the look for an updated definition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern can fit in a variety of styles, including traditional, minimalist, or farmhouse. </span><span class="s1">Here, a look at seven different Sweeten renovations proving a modern classic bathroom is in the eye of the beholder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tactile finishes deliver a modern bathroom design</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46812 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Actress Jaime Ray Newman and partner Guy Nattiv worked with two designers and their Sweeten contractor to form a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-of-a-kind look for their remodel</a>. In their master bathroom, they chose multiple unique handmade tiles for the walls and floors. Also, a light wood vanity was a natural material that anchored the whole space. As a result, the couple’s choices proved that light-color tile with texture and shape could bring just the right amount of subtle drama to a modern bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Modern bathroom with mixed finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-and-white-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-41691 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their bathroom remodel</a> with floor-to-ceiling white subway tile gave Tina and Andrew a classic base to build on. What they added to it brought personality and dimension. A vintage-style exposed shower fixture shows what’s old is new again. The mixing of finishes—brass and chrome—is a popular trend. For extra storage, a double-wide medicine cabinet extends past the custom blue vanity for some asymmetry. Lastly, a shower curtain textile with a pattern and tassel trim is the final soft touch.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A soft side to modern</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" title="subway-tiles-blue-paint-bathroom-walls" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg" alt="wood veneer custom cabinets with glass shower door and white vessel sink on floating cabinet after renovation " width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-33433 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Melissa’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500-square-foot apartment</a> went through clever design changes for her and her partner to live comfortably. Their bathroom, which barely had room to turn around in, borrowed square footage from the bedroom next door. The couple’s design plan demonstrates that a modern vibe can have a softer side. The cool stone-look tile pulls you in with help from natural light streaming in. Also, soft curves in the drop-in sink and fixtures add to the ambiance. Wood tones always bring in warmth when a space needs it. Here&#8217;s one more modern idea: a built-in cabinet inside the shower is tucked between a beam and shower wall for covered storage!</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A clean<span>—</span>but not overly simple<span>—</span>aesthetic</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="A modern bathroom design of Moroccan tile floor and subway tile shower" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone wp-image-48734 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sisters <span class="s3">Nicole and Missy</span> turned to Sweeten to begin their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlington bathroom renovation</a>. Nicole originally thought she wanted a simple and clean white bathroom. However, as the project unfolded, she realized she wanted more personality in the design thanks to her Sweeten contractor&#8217;s suggestions. The sliding barn shower door and white-washed oak vanity came in to complete this modern bathroom design. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Black matte finish on a clean canvas</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with marble stone and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This Manhattan couple went with a minimalist white color scheme for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Greenwich Village</a> modern <span class="s3">bathroom design.</span> Their Sweeten contractor installed a sleek vanity characterized by linear silhouettes and a geometric shower niche. A black matte faucet was installed on the wall, which boosts the contemporary factor. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Gray grout offsets modern gold touches</span></h3>
<div>
<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg" alt="A modern bathroom with white walls, gray tile and wooden vanity" width="666" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-49439 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg 666w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></div>
</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For <span class="s3">Amy and Kevin’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">LA bathroom renovation,</span></a> they, like many other renovators, chose classic subway tile. However, they tweaked the look by using gray grout. (Gray is a great choice as it is both classic and contemporary at the same time.) They also selected a large-format gray tile for the floor, which grounded the room. To pull in a traditional aesthetic, the couple put in a 30-inch vanity in a natural wood tone. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A modern bathroom design mixes in classic fixtures</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46861 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="A modern Chicago bathroom with gray walls, stone tile and double vanity sink" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s2">Leah and Brian</span><span class="s1"> worked with a Sweeten contractor to update their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago loft’s bathroom</a>. They went with antique brass for the finishes—as seen in the pendant light, shower head, and faucet—to give it a classic look. To add in a modern vibe, they chose porcelain tile in a gloss finish for the walls. Matte finish tiles laid in a herringbone pattern on the shower floor complete the look.</span></p>

<h3>Learning to navigate a New York renovation</h3>
<p>A first—and obvious—lesson in renovating: it really is harder in New York. When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we’d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work—and learned what a reno here really takes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.</span></p>
<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early—we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we’d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.</span></p>

</p></blockquote>
<h3>Finding the right general contractor with multiple skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t sure exactly what we needed—walls weren’t moving, but our co-op required an architect. So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif" alt="Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building’s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn’t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix—for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen banquette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every possible corner.</span></p>
<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough—designed as an eat-in when 24” of counter space seemed ample—but the two doorways weren’t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48614" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg" alt="Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-foyer-full-length bookcase" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48609 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg" alt="Gray foyer with full length bookcase and brown wood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Giving the foyer a purpose </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8” deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There’s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors—the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar—then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-ceiling-white-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48619 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg" alt="Black ceiling with white subway tiles in bathroom with white tub and shower glass and white hex floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries—and taking advantage of our building’s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-white-bathroom-shower-glass" class="alignnone wp-image-48621 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg" alt="Black and white bathroom with shower glass and wall sconces and white bathtub after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-15-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn’t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn’t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-white-kitchen-wall-sconces" class="alignnone wp-image-48624 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg" alt="Black and white kitchen with wall sconces and shower glass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Finding the budget for hardwood floors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at—and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile—the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment—despite disliking their color—or redoing everything. Our contractor’s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming comfortable with flexibility </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York’s interminable series of permits, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-op requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and engineering reports—paired with the inelasticity of old spaces—meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you’re looking for before you start to remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It’s not the disruption that’s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more—it’s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we’ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like—at least to our taste—we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.</span></p>

Can opening the shower to the rest of the room create a more efficient, luxurious-feeling space? Sweeten explores the possibilities of this intriguing approach.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What is a wet room bathroom? </span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1">A wet room is a bathroom that typically has no enclosure separating the shower or tub from the rest of the bathroom. All of the walls and the flooring are sealed against water, just like the surfaces in a typical shower stall. </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main flooring of the wet room is on the same level as the shower floor. The section of the wet room where the shower is located has a floor with a sharp slope to aid with water drainage. The rest of the bathroom floor is sloped toward the same drain. But the floor slope is more gradual.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Because there is so much water, bathroom facilities such as the toilet and sink are either raised or are water-sealed.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Due to how wet rooms work, the function of the room is prioritized over the style. Subsequently, most wet room design is clean and spare.</span></p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are wet rooms so popular?</span></h3><ul><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Frameless showers let in more light. These use sheets of thick, unframed glass to surround the shower in a wet room. They make</span><span class="s1"> the whole room lighter and airier. </span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Since wet rooms are designed with excellent ventilation, they typically see less mold and mildew growth.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet rooms are much easier to clean. There are no cramped enclosures to deal with, and the whole floor can be hosed down.</span></li><li class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room bathrooms are ready for all phases of a person’s life. There are no steps or curbs keeping walkers and wheelchairs out of the shower area. The toilet area merges seamlessly with the shower, too. </span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pros and cons of wet rooms</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pros</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathroom feels brighter and more spacious because it has fewer walls and barriers.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The floor is easy to clean—all water can be directed to a single drain.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Accessibility: there is no shower curb or bathtub wall to step over. </span><span class="s1">Wet room designs comply with many <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/guide-aging-in-place-universal-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aging-in-place design rules.</a><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">There&#8217;s less chance of mold, mildew, and water decay.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The bathing area does not steam up because it is not enclosed.<br /></span></li></ul><p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cons</b></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Splashes from the shower can go everywhere.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s best to have plenty of space, to keep the shower separate from dry areas.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">In smaller bathrooms, dry areas need to be made water-resistant.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">It can feel colder in the shower, since there&#8217;s no enclosure to hold in heat.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">The need for more tile work may increase costs.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">They can be acoustically loud and bright because of the open design and hard materials.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><span class="s1">Most things stored in the bathroom need to be enclosed in water-resistant cabinets.<br /></span></li></ul><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Features and special considerations</span></h3><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Shower enclosures</b>: Many wet room bathrooms are built without any shower enclosures. However, you can opt for an open enclosure with no door. Or you can add a half-wall to minimize splashing.</span><span class="s1"><br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Bathroom storage</b>: Locating storage and linen cabinets outside of the bathroom is one way to deal with moisture. Another is to install water-resistant cabinets in the room.<br /></span></li><li><span class="s1"><b>Large wet rooms</b>: If you have a big enough space, you may be able to store moisture-sensitive items in the bathroom without special cabinets. </span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Radiant heating</b>: You can install <a href="https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/7-myths-about-radiant-heat-debunked-49301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiant floor heating</a> even though the floor will see plenty of water. Special underfloor radiant heating kits are available.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Raised sink cabinet</b>: Pedestal sinks or cantilevered countertops are ideal choices for keeping cabinetry off the floor.<br /></span></li><li class="li3"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Relocated heating register</b>: Heating vents cannot be built into the floor. Either build the vents into walls or use another type of heating.<br /></span></li></ul><p>When you&#8217;re ready to begin your bathroom or home remodel, discuss with your <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor if a wet room</a> is possible in your space.</p><h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wet room bathroom maintenance and cleaning</span></h3><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Homeowners may worry about installing wet room bathrooms on upper floors. Yet a professionally installed wet room is no different than locating a freestanding shower on an upper floor. The waterproofing methods are the same—just on a larger scale. Be aware that just like with any bathroom, a wet room could eventually spring a leak and require maintenance.</span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wet room floors are easy to clean. You can clean the flooring with a mild floor cleaner and a rubber-bladed mop. Start on the far end of the room and push water toward the shower drain. You can also use a hand-held shower head as a hose.  </span></p><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Walls in regular bathrooms can be difficult to clean, especially when they&#8217;re made of drywall or plaster. Wet room walls are hardscaped and water-sealed. So, you can clean them with soap and water without fear of damage.</span></p><p class="p1"><i>A note on fixture and appliance deliveries</i>: If you’re on a tight timeline, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100545793-15162279"><span class="s1">Appliances Connection</span></a> has over 50,000 items in stock and ready to ship nationally.

<h2>In smaller bathrooms, a bathtub to shower conversion saves space</h2>

<h3>This bathroom refresh tops the wishlist</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you love walk-in showers, you’re not alone. A larger shower area, easy entry, and a streamlined look make walk-in showers an attractive choice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to move forward on a bathtub to shower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is closely connected to lifestyle. For example, a family with small children may want to keep a bathtub if there is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only one bathroom. Accessibility for limited mobility is another reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&#8217;re already planning an overall bathroom remodel, this is a good time to consider whether swapping the tub for a shower makes sense.</span><span class="s1"> Discuss with your contractor if your desired shower size will fit in your space. </span><span class="s1">For a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathtub to shower conversion</a> consider shower size, windows, lighting, exhaust fan, and the condition and location of plumbing. </span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Find inspiration from these Sweeten homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/">made the change</a>.</span></span></p>

<h3>Gaining a more useful shower</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a second bathroom in their Upper East Side co-op, Laura and Randy had to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximize their one bath</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They removed the pretty, but impractical, bathtub. And they installed a modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">walk-in shower</a>—with three different shower heads and a seat.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A new supercharged shower</span></h3>
<p><span class="s1">Meg and Brett already had a spacious glass shower/tub combination in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/carriage-house-turn-loft-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft apartment</a>. However, by removing the tub, they added several more layers to create a luxurious experience. A low curb reveals a patterned floor tile for a two-person shower. Double shower heads, body sprays, and a rain shower complete the upgraded vista.</span></p>

<h3>Accessibility with style</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary reason for Mickey’s remodel was to build a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-accessible-kitchen-and-bath-remodel-make-good-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom shower</a>. Looking towards retirement and possible limited mobility, he replaced the high-walled tub with a walk-in shower. His Sweeten contractor handled all of the paperwork for the co-op board approval so Mickey was able to focus on choosing materials.</span></p>

<h3>Removing an unwieldy fixture</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charon and Lex&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment bathtub</a> took up too much space; i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t took up almost the whole room. The new shower with the glass door makes the room feel huge without the bulk. </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35156 size-full" title="bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Replacing a bathtub for a standing shower leaves this space feeling spacious and streamlined" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A new layout with lots of personality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by her own parent’s accessibility updates, Megan and Zak decided to follow suit when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/carnegie-hill-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating their guest bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They converted the old bathtub to a standing shower and opted for no glass doors.</span></p>

<h3>Setting bathroom priorities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the small, pink tub in Giulia’s bath was the best way to get more space for a larger sink. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She designed an</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/brownstone-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was shorter than the original tub, making more room for a larger vanity and mirror.</span></p>

<h3>Safety first</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Elaine, safety was paramount. When undergoing the bathtub to shower conversion, she tasked her Sweeten contractor with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/brooklyn-bathroom-staying-in-place-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">walk-in shower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with accessible features: a hand bar and shower, plus a rough stone floor for traction.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Michele</i></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Getting excited to renovate</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I lead a digital product design team for a large San Francisco-based company. I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over a decade, and I had been meaning to renovate my bathroom since I moved in, but I always found a reason not to. The bath hadn’t had an upgrade since the building’s 1980s conversion to co-op! The pedestal sink wasn’t fully attached to the wall, the tub tiles were loosening, and the glass tile floor, which a previous owner had painted, was flaking.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">My apartment is on the top floor of a 1910s five-story building, and it suffered damage during a co-op-sponsored roof renovation a couple of years back. When the building’s contractor completed the repairs, I got excited about renovating. My recently acquired work-from-home job gave me more incentive. I’d updated my home office to suit the remote role, but experiencing my out-of-date bathroom all day, every day, prompted me to get planning.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">Finding inspiration from other renovators</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I spent so much time on Sweeten, reading this blog, and looking at other people’s projects! It was a tremendous help seeing what other people had done. </span><span class="s5">I had strong ideas about how I wanted to proceed, but I needed help turning them into particular products, finishes, and colors.</span> <span class="s1">Sweeten provided me with a range of contractors and design-build firms who gave me numerous options. I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5415#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose my Sweeten contractor</a> because his ideas matched mine.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I’d done advance planning for the bathroom and had a clear idea of what I wanted: a floating vanity, a drop-in tub, oversized subway tile, and dramatic tile flooring. I was attracted to images of gray kitchens and bathrooms with boldly patterned floors. I envisioned something that was calm and streamlined, to make the space feel bigger and take advantage of the high ceiling. My apartment is modern and open. I wanted the bath and kitchen to feel integrated, rather than set apart from the rest of the space.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47057" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg" alt="pattern tile bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractors were great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall&#8230;</span></p></blockquote>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A new dishwasher becomes a full kitchen remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, my plan had been to simply install a new dishwasher. Then it was suggested that a pantry could be added in the then-unused space at the kitchen’s entrance. The original kitchen plan I had posted to Sweeten was of a smaller scope, but after meeting them, I asked the contractors to submit follow-up <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bids for a full kitchen remodel</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the kitchen, I worked with my contractor to come up with a plan. I put together the light and dark gray cabinets with chrome handles and found a quartz countertop flecked with both colors. I picked the same flooring that the designer had used in their showroom.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Transforming the bathroom wasn’t so hard. I saw a tile floor I liked in the sale listing of another apartment in my building and tracked it down. Finding a bathtub that would fit the small space was a challenge, but we did. (The white tub looked yellow next to the tile, so we had it reglazed.) Because of pipes in the wall, we couldn’t create storage niches in the shower, so the team extended the interior windowsill with a white quartz surface material—a shampoo perch. The floating sink is mounted a bit higher than standard because I’m tall.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A timely business trip</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The project’s biggest challenge was also something of a stroke of luck: My boss asked me to travel from New York to San Francisco, starting the day demolition began. <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I stayed for almost three weeks</a>. While I was away, the Sweeten construction team kept me posted and sent pictures daily. The contractor was great at explaining problems long-distance: I’ll never forget the crew piling on a conference call about my formerly crooked bathroom wall while I waited outside an executive office at work!</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Instead of hiring a project manager, I worked as my own. I had spreadsheets for how much had been spent versus budgeted. I tracked what had been ordered, shipped, and delivered. I’m not that organized, but I turned into a full-on spreadsheet ninja. It kept me from panicking.</span></p>
<div><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-47060 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></div>
<h3 class="p5">Finishing the bathroom and kitchen renovation during COVID-19</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">By the time COVID-19 hit and the lockdown was ordered, we were 95 percent done. We had to wait for the lockdown to lift and for my building to let the crew return, clearly articulating when they would arrive, and wearing masks as required.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually, we finished. After expanding my renovation’s scope, I spent significantly more than I originally intended to—close to $100,000 all told, but that includes fully updated plumbing and new floors in both rooms. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I have enough storage space in the kitchen and bathroom that nothing falls out when I open a cabinet! I love cooking; I’ve got a lot of ingredients and equipment, and it’s so nice not to feel like I’m overstuffing every corner. Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment! I’m also enjoying the dishwasher. I love the way the kitchen tile feels under my feet, and how the rooms are designed for me, with my interests and needs—even my career—in mind. That customization is the greatest luxury of the whole thing.</span></p>

<h3>Starting a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah, a lawyer in the finance industry, bought her prewar one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. She spent several years living in the apartment before embarking on a kitchen renovation. She also redid the floors. “The decisions I made after really living in the space were just better—how I moved in and out of the kitchen, how the rooms communicated with each other,” she said.</p>

<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="frameless glass enclosure for white bathtub in a white bathroom with white oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31831" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3>Reaching out for help</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation projects became exhausting, so she took a break—even though the bathroom was disjointed from the rest of the apartment, with its beige tones and frumpy &#8217;70s aesthetic. It also had a dropped ceiling for seemingly no reason, which cramped the small space. “I backed away because it seemed like too much to take on,” she said, but she finally took the plunge and posted her NYC prewar bathroom remodel on Sweeten to find a general contractor.</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="glass enclosed tub" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31836" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Raising up a dropped ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah envisioned something that was reflective of her co-op building’s beautiful foyer with its marble and clean look. “I think my design was to let the space speak for itself,” she said. The Sweeten contractors she hired set out to raise the ceiling. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what we were going to find,&#8221; Leah said. Because they could not find any pipes or any other obvious reason for the dropped ceiling, they were able to raise it again.</p>
<p>She selected classic subway tiles for the walls and a marble top for the vanity. With the floors, the Sweeten contractors made a reassuring discovery—the original tiles were still underneath, and matched the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new creamy hexagon tiles</a> Leah had chosen. It was a confirmation that her design choices were in line with how the bathroom was originally meant to be.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="neutral bathroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31838" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Adding warmth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Leah had planned for white and silver tones, she made a last-minute decision to bring in gold fixtures. “I wanted to add warmth,” she said of the 11th-hour choice. Luckily, she found the renovation process to be far less taxing than she had anticipated. She was in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily communication</a> with her Sweeten contractors, who helped solve problems and helped her make those nuts-and-bolts decisions, like how far up the wall the tiles should go. “It was a very collaborative process,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="gold bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31834" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-16-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-16-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Saving for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah decided early on where she would save money (like tile choices) <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with her remodeling budget</a> and where she would spend more lavishly. Because of the small space, she decided on a custom bathtub, which took six weeks to make in South Carolina. “Every bathtub that was standard was made for bigger spaces,” she said. “I needed something that fit my dimensions.” The shower enclosure and tub combination became a show stopping centerpiece of the bathroom and were well worth the wait.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Smart upgrades for the kitchen and bathroom solve pesky problems</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When Ryan, an editor, and Sophie, a paralegal, envisioned their renovation, they knew they needed to address the problems they inherited from the “quick and dirty reno” completed in 2009, the year Ryan bought the apartment. The advantage of waiting years to renovate? “It was abundantly clear how we utilized the kitchen,” says Ryan, adding “I had 10 years to save up because even a modest renovation like this one isn’t cheap in NYC!” In their 750-square foot, prewar one-bedroom on the Upper West Side, the partners agreed that the odd-shaped kitchen needed rearranging to take advantage of every square inch; and the bathroom required rescuing from a “South Florida Grandma aesthetic.”</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i> To tackle <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/37791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the project, they posted</a> on </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/"><span class="s2"><i>Sweeten</i></span></a><i>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their projects, and </i><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169#overview"><span class="s2"><i>chose their contractor</i></span></a><i>. </i></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44140 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg" alt="kitchen-white-cabinets-bar seating-remodel" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Kitchen-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Ryan</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whoever designed the last renovation really did not think things through. In the kitchen, which is an odd trapezoidal space, the priority was maximizing both storage and counter space, and minimizing clutter. For instance, there was a 24-inch soffit between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling that was just empty space. So we knew we’d need cabinets extending to the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44150 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg" alt="renovators portrait-new york city" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ryan-Portrait-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sink was on a diagonal resulting in a large dead space. And the refrigerator was a huge obstruction at the back of the room and the first thing you see when you enter the foyer. Its positioning made the kitchen seem smaller and it just needed to find a new spot. We weren’t sure if that was possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bathroom was small and dark with very little natural light. The vanity was made of builder-grade particle board that had swollen with moisture, and the medicine cabinet protruded. We were intent on transforming the look and feel of the bathroom—even the toilet was pink! The living room got a refresh with repainted walls, a replastered ceiling, and new sconce lighting.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kitchen, I commissioned a one-hour consult with an interior designer, Clare of <a href="https://www.121studio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One to One Studio</a>, while still planning everything out. The designer suggested moving the refrigerator to the corner and relocating the doorway to accommodate the fit. That might seem obvious in retrospect, but to me, it was a revelation. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We went with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/product-101-kitchen-cabinet-door-materials-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets so everything</a> would look integrated. The odd-shaped kitchen space came with difficult angles, pipes, and protrusions. We went to Ikea to experiment with a layout, but couldn’t get their premade boxes to fit in a satisfactory way. I also tried </span><span class="s3">Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, which had more options in terms of box sizes, but I worried the boxes wouldn’t be delivered in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor’s millworker was about twice the cost of </span><span class="s3">Ikea and Cabinets.com</span><span class="s1">, but still about $5,000 less than the cabinets in the next price tier. He was able to build boxes that accommodated the kitchen’s unusual dimensions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The kitchen floor tile came from the designer, during our consult. I asked her specifically what I should get since I was stumped by all the options. She recommended black slate tile: durable, attractive, and cheap. Her basic ethos was “make it look expensive without being expensive.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The backsplash, on the other hand, was a splurge. We always </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> scallop tiles. Initially, we envisioned a teal color but we realized it was just too loud. So we went with a scalloped tile in muted but varied gray tones. The countertop was another more expensive finish: Empira White featured veining we really liked that complemented the backsplash.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie </span><span class="s3">wanted</span><span class="s1"> slab cabinets without any pulls, and I agreed. By then, I was really <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/qa-with-jean-selecting-and-ordering-materials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffering from decision fatigue</a> and didn’t have the wherewithal to evaluate the merits of different cabinet hardware!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sophie chose the kitchen to be clean and streamlined, whereas I wanted the bathroom to have quirkier touches. I put together a sort of mood board where we considered a bunch of looks like intricate marble mosaics, but marble stains and needs a lot of upkeep. Plus, our contractor recommended we get large-format tile, due to some peculiarities of the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ultimately chose 36”x36” glazed porcelain tile that looks like marble at about $4/square foot, which was pretty reasonable, especially since we tiled up to the ceiling. It also worked well on the floor given the bathroom’s size constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vanity was more of a splurge, but I justified it because I hadn’t seen other vanities quite like it. And it fit. A 25-inch vanity would have been too small, and a 30-inch vanity would have been crammed in. The Goldilocks vanity needed to be between 25 to 30 inches, but powder room vanities sit comfortably within that range. I just had to pay twice what I’d initially budgeted. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-white-bathtub"  class="alignnone wp-image-44065 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg" alt="white bathroom with white bathtub and white vanity with stand and large frameless mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Ryan-Bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The renovation itself mostly went off without a hitch, from getting board approval to designing it to seeing the project through to completion. Our contractor helped a lot with the paperwork. Between the management company and the board, there were A LOT of forms that I needed to put together. Luckily, the contractor had worked in the building before, which is one of the reasons I hired him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when. Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership. Have a plan before you hire a contractor, know what you want and why you want it, so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the renovation, my downstairs neighbor was particularly helpful. She winters in Florida, and let us stay in her apartment, meaning we didn’t have to find a place to crash. I work from home most days, so I could stay in the building and check out the renovation throughout the day to make sure we were adhering to the plan. Also, I didn’t have to find a place to board my cat, Titus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Besides the clean look, I love how our new kitchen is all integrated. From a functionality standpoint, I’m very pleased with its usability. It easily accommodates two people working at the same time, has tons of storage space and counter space, yet still seems open.</span></p>
<p><em><span class="s1">Thank you, Sophie and Ryan, for sharing your journey with us!</span></em></p>

</ul>
<h3>Bathroom need color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owners Rachel and Michael didn’t want to go super modern with their bathroom update, so they went with a classic look that complemented their apartment’s prewar roots. The original space was dark and in an uninspiring neutral, the shower was cramped and confined by uneven walls, and old chipped tile throughout had clearly seen better days.  A remodel was in order. The couple posted their project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose their contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43078 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-9-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>Creating more space without changing the layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping the existing layout intact, Rachel and Michael made crucial updates, starting with tearing down the unnecessary wall framing of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>which added an extra nine inches to the height of the shower<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>and swapping the old glass door for a new one. With a bigger and brighter space to fill, a waterfall of penny tile in various shades of blue shines as a showpiece. The open and light-filled shower with its mosaic of tile is now Michael’s favorite part of the bathroom.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43069 size-full" title="Blue and white bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg" alt="blue bathroom renovation" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael-bathroom-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>A contrast between colors</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dusky shade of blue paint dominates the upper half of the walls while balancing the crackle-finish white subway tile with the right amount of contrast. White hexagon floor tile adds another layer of pattern. The tub also experienced a major improvement: out went the old tub with a clunky, external drainage system, and in went the new with an integrated system, vintage-style wall-mount tub filler, and a tiled tub surround.</p>

<h3>Same bathroom, bigger feel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a month of going back and forth on deciding on the replacement, the couple switched out the boxy, builder-grade vanity for an open console design, making the space feel considerably larger. A mirrored medicine cabinet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">triple-light fixture over the vanity</a>—Rachel’s favorite details—complete the look. The result? A room once bathed in beige gets new energy. [For these homeowners, an open-console vanity was a must.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a master bathroom in Pelham, New York</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: In advance of moving into their newly purchased Pelham home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom in Westchester, Alexy and her husband decided to get some necessary renovations out of the way. The couple had a five-year-old and were pregnant with their second child. They were still living in Brooklyn, which made this reno project one that would be done from afar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house only had showers, which aren’t ideal for bathing infants. They decided to add a tub to the second-floor bathroom, which had already undergone a renovation by the previous owner that had stolen some space from the neighboring bedroom. “The bedroom closet was just a few inches deep with some shelves,” Alexy said. There was also the absence of a linen closet on the second floor. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-shiplap-blue-bathroom" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49004 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="White shiplap and blue bathroom with oval sink and blue bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-during-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49005 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-During-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-During-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-During-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Alexy-Bathroom-During-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Alexy was familiar with Sweeten from the service&#8217;s many renovations in Brooklyn, but didn&#8217;t know any general contractors in Westchester. She needed to find one she could trust since the house would be empty. They tried to get to Pelham on weekends to check on the work even though Alexy was nine months pregnant.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor they chose</a> took space from the hallway to add a large linen closet to the bathroom. &#8220;It holds a lot, and that is exactly what I wanted,” said Alexy. The redistributed hallway space also provided the extra room needed to add a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> to the shower area. Alexy’s husband originally wanted a double vanity, but there just wasn’t enough room. After much soul-searching, he decided what he really wanted was adequate counter space. The vanity they went with had a counter that stretched to the wall while adding more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> underneath.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The project was finished pretty much on time except for the vanity, which took a long time to be delivered, but their Sweeten contractor stuck to the budget and they encountered no surprises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A glass shower door brings light and transparency to any space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While shower curtains can add flair to your bathroom, they aren’t always ideal for smaller spaces or a more streamlined look. Enter the glass shower door: it immediately makes a room feel more spacious, modern, and clean. They’re also easy on upkeep—a quick swipe with a squeegee and you’re good to go. These glass panels come in a variety of styles, can be framed with metal or rimless for a “floating” look, and can be fixed, sliding, or made to swivel on a hinge. Take a look below for some favorite bathroom renovations done by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors.</p>

			<h2>With options in size, material, and shape, a relaxing room is only a soak away</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-10 alignnone wp-image-27086 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01" width="989" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg 989w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x488.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-300x202.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-600x405.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Of all the features in the bath, the tub takes center stage. In particular, the freestanding tub can take on a shape that turns it into a sculpture and a unique focal point for the room. If you are considering adding a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dimension to your bathroom</a>, read on for <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s</a> <span class="s1">bathroom remodeling ideas with a tub.</span></p>
<p class="p3">There have been a lot of advances since the days of the good, old clawfoot tub, although you can have that if you want it. There are loads of options to help you create a custom look, such as:</p>
<p>*Fluid, sculptural profiles in symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes</p>
<p>*Non-slip surfaces</p>
<p>*Color on the interior and/or exterior</p>
<p>*Backs with lumbar support</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All major manufacturers, including American Standard, Signature Hardware, and DXV, offer a wide dollar range that can keep the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price for your bathroom remodel</a> within your budget.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Choose a style</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to the sleek profiles of freestanding tubs, most styles will work with any type of décor, from traditional to transitional to contemporary. So if you select a style you like, then change your mind in a few years about the design of the bath, chances are you can keep the tub and it will still look right. Manufacturers often create “suites” of fixtures—matching sink, tub, and even toilet—if that’s the look you&#8217;re after.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expect to find freestanding tubs in three basic shapes: oval, rectangular, and round. Most freestanding tubs come with the option of either a footed or “skirted” (concealed) bottom. These are the most common and popular styles:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Floor-set</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Available in a range of profiles from oval or rectangular to round or square, these <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-historic-brownstone-bath-remodel-stays-true-to-its-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tubs sit directly on the floor</a>, with the base covered by a “skirt.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Slipper</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaped like the footwear the name describes, this classic tub shape is higher on one side to encourage reclining. Some versions have equally high sides at either end. To enhance the slipper shape, this tub is most commonly specified with feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Soaking</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This style came into vogue in the ‘90s with the emergence of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/an-l-a-bath-remodel-reveals-wet-room-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at-home spa</a> movement and feng shui. The sides rise as high as the shoulders or neck of an average-size person, so the body is submerged in water. The circumference tends to be smaller than other tubs, so it doesn’t take an entire lake to fill with water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Footed</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You probably know it as the clawfoot tub; this bathing beauty conjures the ambiance of another era, minus the chore of filling it with water from a wooden bucket! Manufacturers make a variety of foot styles to lend the tub either a vintage or contemporary effect. Innovations include exterior surfaces that can take customized finishes, including paint in the color of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Extras</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with overall bath trends, you can find a few enhancements in some freestanding tubs, including removable pillows, chromotherapy, and air jets.</p>
<h3>Consider the material</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s tubs are made to take daily use and exposure to all types of water and chemicals from soaps as well as cleansers. Still, you need to carefully consider your choice of materials, which affect durability and weight, and the tub’s installation. For instance, a lighter-weight tub, one that’s made of acrylic as opposed to cast iron, will be easier to maneuver during installation, and less likely to require additional support for the floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Acrylic</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A type of plastic, this material is appreciated for its many attributes: lightweight with a high gloss, deep-color finish that allows most scratches to be buffed out. Acrylic also allows the water to keep its heat more readily than metals such as cast iron. Because it is a plastic that can be formed, it lends itself well to tubs with molded armrests or other detailing. Fiberglass reinforces the acrylic to help prevent cracking and chipping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Metal</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a metal look interests you, you’re most likely to find it in the soaking tubs category, in copper or stainless steel. Be forewarned: This metal transmits heat, so your bathwater will quickly cool down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Enameled cast iron</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This classic, extremely durable material conveys a smooth, glossy finish. It transmits heat but it also holds heat, so it may take some finagling to get the bathwater the temperature you desire. Cast iron bathtubs are best used on ground floors. Homeowners should check with their plumber to see if additional structural support may be needed.</p>
<h3>Measure properly</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must get accurate dimensions for your space and for the tub you are considering. In addition to the manufacturer’s dimensions, look in a showroom and take the measurement from the distance at the longest point of the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most freestanding tubs average about 5 feet by 2 ½ feet. Their luxurious reputation might cause you to think this type of tub only fits in a large bath. Since they don’t require an alcove or a platform, they can fit in many smaller bathrooms.</p>
<h3>Plan before installation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation goes much like it does for any tub, with a few precautions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Weight</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When researching or shopping for tubs, find out how much the tub weighs, empty as well as full of water. Then consult with your contractor to determine if additional structural support is necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pipes</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before settling on your selection, locate the room’s water pipes and where you want to place the drain. Make sure you have enough floor space to position the tub. Check the width of doorways, hallways, and staircases by which the tub will be moved. You don’t want to suddenly discover you have to break through a wall to install that luxurious tub. Be aware that pipes that go from the wall to the tub may show. Consult with your contractor to find a version you can stand to look at day in and day out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Faucet</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the tub standing alone on the floor, you may be wondering where the faucet goes. The most common solution is a floor-mounted fitting centered on the long or short side of the tub. This allows placement of the tub under a window or centered in a space; pretty much anywhere the plumbing lines will allow. If the tub can be installed close to the wall, particularly in a small bath, then a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-weekend-home-in-amagansett-remodels-in-minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wall-mount tub filler</a> will work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some manufacturers make tubs that permit a deck mount of the faucet and its handles. Ask to see all the configurations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drains are positioned either in the center or on the left or right. Consider the location of the plumbing in the bath before choosing or you will have to pay to have the pipes extended or rerouted.</p>
<h3>Tips on maintenance</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow your regular cleaning routine but only use manufacturer-recommended products. Not all cleansers work well on all surfaces. A lotion-like cleanser that is suitable for porcelain or enameled cast iron may scratch an acrylic tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thoroughly rinse the surface after bathing and again after cleaning. Leaving cleanser on the tub can permanently harm the finish. Avoid wearing jewelry in the tub or anything else that might scratch acrylic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tub is one of the biggest expenditures you will make in your bath, so invest in quality. The manufacturer should offer a limited lifetime warranty. Follow the instructions for care, using only recommended products. Then breathe a sigh of true relaxation as you settle into the serenity of your beautiful freestanding tub.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to begin your bathroom renovation, securing the expertise of an experienced and <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified general contractor</a> should be at the top of your list. Make sure they are licensed, insured, and have extensive knowledge working in your area. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work with Sweeten</a> to connect with the best contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b><b></b>A hex tile bathroom provides a new look, plus a West Elm side table moonlights as a vanity</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we took a peek at Amy and Nick’s sparkling new <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>. This week, we’re exploring their new bathroom, which takes a style cue from a previous Sweeten story.</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-hex-tile-bathroom"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49234 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Amy-BathKitchen-04.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black hex tile along with sink and vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Refresh an outdated bath in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After purchasing their 2-bed, 1-bath condo, it became clear to Amy and Nick that the old bathroom needed to be given new life. The layout worked, but the tile and fixtures were tired and out-of-style, and a low ceiling made the space feel cramped.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had successfully renovated their kitchen (and who they’d found on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with general contractors after </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posting their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) got to work on the bathroom remodel. The layout was preserved but the footprint was expanded; one wall was moved and the ceiling was raised to make the space feel larger. The old tile was ripped up and replaced with a hex tile bathroom floor paired with high-contrast white grout. White subway tile was installed in the shower, along the side of the tub, and across the lower half of the walls. All new fixtures in polished chrome gave the space a bright boost. A new sink and vanity with a Calacatta gold <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> countertop was placed center stage (the marble was also added to the windowsill and threshold), while a wall-mounted faucet provides a sleek, contemporary look. It took a couple of tries for Amy and Nick to find the right <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> that would work with their piping; Amy explained, &#8220;W</span>e knew from the beginning we needed a horizontal connection—just not all the horizontally piped toilets we bought worked for our specific connection. Eventually, we just had our contractor pick one out for us and switched the handle so it was more in line aesthetically with what we&#8217;d originally picked out.&#8221; A large, recessed medicine cabinet was added above the sink in addition to customized storage; &#8220;I like the two built-in nooks (in the shower)—it makes it easy to separate bath products by person and height. We&#8217;re also both really pleased with the way the side table/vanity turned out,&#8221; said Amy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The vanity was fashioned from a West Elm side table customized to fit a countertop and pedestal sink. Amy was inspired by Sweeten homeowners </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who created their own custom vanity in a similar way.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Hex floor tile in a matte finish: </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Metro-Hex-2-in-Matte-11-1-8-in-x12-5-8-in-Black-Porcelain-Mosaic-9-64-sq-ft-case-FXLM2HMB/203684370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Depot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years after Kelly purchased her studio apartment in a lovely Brooklyn Heights co-op, she was ready to take on a major overhaul of the old appliances and cheap cabinets in the kitchen and bath.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly had come to realize that living in a studio apartment meant that the kitchen would forever be the focal point—it “needed to rock”, as she put it. With old appliances and “cheap” cabinets and counters, the kitchen lacked a ton of functionality. An earlier attempt at open shelving left all sorts of things exposed, the cabinets extended just halfway to the ceiling, bar seating offered zero storage topped with a thin strip of counter prep space, and the stove and fridge were both miniature-sized. Kelly wanted to find an interior designer whose imagination wasn’t limited by tight spaces. She </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched her with Sweeten Expert Courtney</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pro at bringing ambitious texture and color to spaces large and small. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Kelly wasn’t yet set on any specific style choices for her kitchen, Courtney was able to provide plenty of inspiration to get the renovation process started. The plans called for a few big fixes: Kelly’s team would extend the kitchen cabinets to ceiling height for more storage and finish the cabinetry with a variety of classic doors and transparent glass panes. The bar counter was significantly enlarged, granting more prep and dining space and doubling the kitchen’s drawer storage. And to accommodate a full-sized stove and fridge, Kelly moved the fridge out of the galley altogether.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly appreciated Courtney’s talent for mixing affordable items with the right amount of higher-end items for a polished look. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous flooring consisted of brick-colored tiles that dragged the room into darkness. Kelly chose eye-catching cement tiles in a white and soft black mosaic, evoking a sense of Moroccan-inspired decor. Kelly bid adieu to the old, sagging cabinets and selected a dove gray IKEA set for the bottom base with a matte white finish for the uppers, plus elegant chrome hardware for all. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her newly-enlarged bar counter, Courtney helped Kelly pick butcher block for its warmth and price point, offsetting that material with a natural stone for the opposite counter. Ready to pack a lot of texture into the small space, Kelly added another pop of personality with a subway-style backsplash of luminous blue hand-glazed ceramic tiles. This detail, along with new undercabinet lighting was the key to unlocking all of that brightness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rickety oven range was replaced with a sleek stainless stove and Kelly scored a matching microwave stationed directly above it. A new dishwasher now resides where the old fridge once stood, and Kelly had new storage and pantry cabinets constructed along the opposite wall, framing the fridge perfectly. Kelly did away with the harsh ceiling light and opted for low-profile recessed lighting instead, complementing her new space gorgeously.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-17844 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg" alt="dove gray ikea cabinets" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Kelly_Kitchen_Bathroom-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renovation plan grew to include the bathroom as well as the secret to the success of any great NYC studio: a highly organized walk-in closet! Without changing the footprint of the bath, Kelly carried several of the design choices from the kitchen over for continuity and coherence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went with the same marbled stone look for the floors and shower walls while replacing the tub with a new white porcelain upgrade. In other splash-prone areas surrounding the sink and shower, Kelly decided on a pale gray glass tile stacked in clean, contemporary lines. The old vanity was replaced with a dark wood cabinet boasting deep storage drawers and a large rectangular sink basin, crowned with a simple mirror and a soft-glow lighting strip. Two chrome shower heads were installed, one flexible and the other stationary, creating an elegant spa oasis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last perk of this smart renovation came in the form of customizing the studio’s remaining closet, including shelving, section dividers, and a full-length mirror. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly’s lovely, revamped studio is proof that no space is too small for showcasing personal taste and imagination. We’re thrilled to hear that Courtney’s eye for design and hustle helped Kelly re-create this beautiful space!</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> You would think that keeping the existing footprint of your bathroom during a renovation wouldn&#8217;t result in much of a difference, but Pallavi and Keyur&#8217;s remodel proves that anything is possible. This post, which originally ran in mid-2015, reveals an absolutely stunning transformation from an outdated washroom coated in a thick layer of grime to a luxurious bath with clean lines, sleek tile, and high-end fixtures. Don&#8217;t believe us? Keep reading and see the change for yourself.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate a bathroom with a small footprint in Murray Hill in Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Pallavi, a sustainability consultant, and Keyur, a software engineer, came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> after a few failed attempts at finding contractors through online directories for their Murray Hill apartment renovation. Initially, they planned to leave the bathroom in its original state, but as the project progressed, they decided to work with their Sweeten general contractor on a complete bathroom remodel to parallel the space-efficient, clean-lined haven they were creating elsewhere in their home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-with-bathtub-and-white-subway-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48994 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pallavi-KitchenBath-Before-1.jpg" alt="White bathroom with bathtub and shower curtain and white subway tiles and vanity mirror before renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pallavi-KitchenBath-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pallavi-KitchenBath-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Pallavi-KitchenBath-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Pallavi had a traditional black-and-white color palette in mind, playing on the bathroom&#8217;s original uniform tile and natural wood elements. She sourced and layered materials in different shapes and sizes and accented the geometric white and black contrast with warm wood features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While all of the fixture footprints were kept in place, the contractor&#8217;s team ripped out the worn floor tiles—remnants of the building’s earliest residents—and replaced them with oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black floor tiles</a>. As an accent, small, square-shaped tiles now line the tub wall and shower niches and also found their way over to the window, creating a wraparound effect for the bath. To outfit the narrow space (so typical of so many NYC bathrooms), Pallavi opted for the Duravit Starck tub and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toto toilet</a>. Both offered slender profiles and simple footprints to keep the space as efficient as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor installed a custom-built wood <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with a Duravit Bacino sink and Kohler Purist wall-mounted faucets to save counter space. He also hung red Kontextur Hanging Lines in lieu of a standard towel rack and toilet paper stand and replaced the rickety shower rod with a ceiling-mounted shower rod.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The balance of modern, minimalist materials against the natural wooden door is a perfect combination that highlights the contrast of colors and textures. Black is still the new black and is surprisingly stunning paired with original and new wooden touches.</p>
