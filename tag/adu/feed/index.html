			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior accessory dwelling unit (JADU) vs. ADU: What&#8217;s the difference? Should you have one&#8230;or both?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide.jpg" alt="Junior accessory dwelling unit with kitchenette" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52779" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JADU_Guide-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ADUs, or accessory dwelling units, have been an ad-hoc housing option forever. They are also known as granny flats, laneway homes, and carriage houses. Accessory dwelling units typically solve one or two challenges for homeowners: money and family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ADU can help a family member, such as a senior parent or a young adult, with a decent place to live. The structure is not subject to the normal rental market of a senior-care facility or living with multiple roommates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, the budgetary bump from rental income could make living in certain properties affordable. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADU can also be an asset at the time of resale</a> if the unit is code-approved and permitted. Now, the JADU, or junior accessory dwelling unit, can be a consideration. Here, we break down what you need to know about JADUs. </span></p>
<h3><strong>What is a JADU?</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to California’s legislation, a JADU is officially designated as a separate dwelling unit of up to 500 square feet. It must have a separate entrance, distinct from the main home. An ADU, in comparison, can be up to 1500 square feet in some locales. Read about building an <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-build-a-chicago-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADU in Chicago here</a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Junior accessory dwelling units as affordable housing</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent years, JADUs have become more recognized and acknowledged as a benefit in places with expensive housing. They’re now built using formalized processes for their construction. In the past, it would have been a garage makeover, for example. In another trend toward affordable housing options, California has recognized the JADU. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Occupancy requirements are defined s</span><span class="s1">pecifically in the local building code. JADUs cannot be used for short-term rentals—fewer than 30 days—and one of the units must be owner-occupied. The only exception is if the owner is “a governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where can a JADU be built?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A JADU must be located within the walls of a proposed or existing space. You cannot put up a small shed and call it a JADU. In fact, you cannot build any new space for the JADU. The JADU can be located within a converted garage, but that will trigger a parking requirement, meaning you will have to replace any converted parking spaces on a 1:1 basis. Just adding a JADU to your existing home, however, does not trigger a parking requirement, so that’s good news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beyond that, the details can change in each municipality. If you’re interested in a JADU project, you’ll need to think hyper-local to ensure that you meet the requirements for permitting. Yes, that means you’ll need to meet the state code at a minimum, and then comply with the local ordinances that apply. You’ll go through a specific permitting process for this project, so an experienced professional would be an invaluable resource.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">JADU requirements and features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One surprising bonus that makes everything easier is that the JADU may share the bathroom with the main house. Considering that plumbing and sanitation modifications are among the most complex and expensive projects, this is welcome! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kitchen space requirements are fairly reasonable. California code may be further restricted by local ordinance. A basic kitchenette is required, which will include something for cooking, a refrigerator, and a sink. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of all the requirements, the separate entrance could be tricky based on the structure and framing of the main home. In addition, getting plumbing pipes and drain pipes to the JADU space will often be the most challenging part of the whole project. But that’s where professionals shine.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Current limitations for JADUs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some municipalities do not allow 220-volt appliances in the kitchenette, for example, so you cannot install a standard range. It appears that some municipalities don’t allow full-size refrigerators, either. In this case, the JADU will be more like a rec room than a true independent apartment, especially if the occupants share the main bathroom. There are many instances where this will not be a problem, such as for tenants who travel and use the JADU as an infrequent home base, or for a college student. A stereotypical “granny flat” may work perfectly as well for a single senior who eats dinner with you often anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And considering that the minimum requirements for a JADU are so low, with just a separate entrance and a kitchenette, this option has the potential to be a fast and simple solution to needing more space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It could feel restrictive, however, when it’s time to rent the space to someone else who may want a more complete kitchen and/or a dedicated bathroom. Many people will undoubtedly feel the JADU is a compromise but at least it’s now an option.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Local ordinances for JADU: A work in progress</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another relevant benefit: you can have both an ADU and a JADU! Yes, you can technically have a sort of triplex on your property. That will certainly boost affordability! From a legal standpoint, a properly permitted JADU does require a deed restriction, which means it’s a legal part of your home property and cannot be sold separately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re interested in this path, remember that the JADU is not simply a smaller ADU. Some requirements differ and you’ll have to nail them all to get approval. An ADU will have to have a separate bathroom, may or may not need a separate entrance, and may not have a parking requirement. There are some details to sort out, clearly. Requirements such as the separate entrance and separate bathrooms, not to mention the parking requirements, demand attention case by case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">California’s legislation, for example, was finalized in late 2021 and some language is still being interpreted. Yes, that does mean that people can come to different conclusions about some of the language in the legislation as they work through the process month after month. Also, local ordinances will continue to crop up and result in a change in requirements and/or process. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is fine-tuning, though, on legislation that is now law, so you can proceed on a new project that helps you get the space you need! In addition to keeping good vibes with building officials, working with a skilled contractor will pay off hugely on a project like this.</span></p>

			<h2 class="p1">Creating an ADU in Chicago is possible with existing structures or building new</h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" title="white-open-kitchen-in-an-adu" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover.jpg" alt="White open kitchen overlooking the living area in an ADU after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51232" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chicago-ADU-Cover-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to a decision by the City Council, accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, are now allowed in five areas of the city of Chicago. The new <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/doh/provdrs/homeowners/svcs/adu-ordinance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Chicago ADU pilot program</span></a> removes the ADU ban in place since 1957. The benefits of Chicago ADUs include creating more affordable housing units while providing income for homeowners. They also offer space for family members at different life stages, also known as multi-generational housing. In this guide, we review how<span> to build ADUs in Chicago</span> and how they could be an asset for homeowners.</p>
<h3 class="p1">What are ADUs?</h3>
<p class="p1">An ADU is not one type of structure, but a variety of types. They can be unattached, as with a carriage house located in the alley or at the back of the lot. They can also be new construction in an existing space in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main residence</a> on the property. Chicago’s ordinance calls these “conversion units.”</p>
<p class="p1">A crucial consideration is the planned use of the unit. If the plan is for rentable living space (thus the term “dwelling unit”), it will need a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. These are the most expensive spaces per square foot, with toilets, sinks, and electrical.</p>
<p class="p1">An ADU without a kitchen or bathroom could be a home office, studio, or a personal retreat outside of the main residence. These are simpler and cheaper than living space, as they’re not dwelling spaces. An ADU, by definition, will also have a separate entrance from the main home, even if attached to or part of the main home.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Why were Chicago ADUs banned?</h3>
<p class="p1">Restrictions on ADUs in Chicago often followed complaints from homeowners who wanted to prevent “undesirable” change in their neighborhoods. Overcrowding and parking issues are still cited, but a nationwide housing crunch has affected many Americans. As a result, more homeowners want a rental unit on their property for income. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/grannie-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Multi-generational housing</span></a> is also seen as an efficient solution financially and for caregiving. More city governments view ADUs as a way to alleviate a very tight housing market.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to get a legal Chicago ADU on your property</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Renovate an existing building into an ADU</h4>
<p class="p1">First, is an ADU <span class="s1">legally allowed</span> on your property? If so, do you have an <span class="s2">existing building? </span>Some remodels to consider include a granny flat or in-law space or rental.</p>
<p class="p1">If there’s existing space, what is it currently used for? Is it a good candidate for renovation for housing? Some older buildings would require a good deal of renovation work that it would be cheaper and faster to remove and replace. A crumbling foundation is a good example of this type of hurdle.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Build a new Chicago ADU</h4>
<p class="p1">Does your lot have sufficient space for <span class="s2">new construction</span>? New space that’s attached to or part of the existing home can involve some complex planning. For example, consider the interface between new electrical, plumbing, foundation, roof, and the existing components. Fortunately, that can all be figured out but requires careful planning.</p>
<p class="p1">When you&#8217;re ready to consider either type of project, it’s wise to consult with a licensed <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in Chicago</a> who has experience with these complexities. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> can help connect you with local contracting firms in your area. Whatever one you build will have to meet all applicable codes. In other words, you don’t get a free pass on anything. The exception is the parking minimum. The pilot program doesn’t require new parking for an ADU. The benefits: new useful space; may increase your property value; and you’ll have a legal, income-producing space.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Chicago ADU pilot program</h3>
<p class="p1">Chicago’s ADU pilot program delineates some regulations by area. For example, under the Chicago ADU pilot program, you cannot remove existing parking to make way for ADUs. Additionally, some areas are limited to two ADU permits per block per year. Some properties are required to meet affordable housing requirements with rent restrictions. Coach houses are limited to a maximum of 700 square feet and a height of 22 feet above grade.</p>
<p class="p1">You might be able to build more than one ADU, as well. Here’s what the program says:</p>
<p class="p5">“The number of ADUs allowed depends on the number of existing legal units on a property:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">For properties with 1 to 4 units, the property owner can add one coach house unit to any property, or one conversion unit to properties that are at least 20 years old</li>
<li class="li5">For properties with 5 or more units, coach houses are not permitted, but the property owner can create up to 33 percent more units as conversion units.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Short-term rentals</h3>
<p class="p1">That brings us to “short-term rentals,” Airbnb, or VRBO. In some locales, ADUs are a flashpoint, as owners can make substantially more money from vacation rentals than traditional rentals. As a result, homeowners with ADUs are switching to short-term rentals. This has caused the supply of traditional rentals to plummet, and that’s led to many restrictions on the number of short-term rentals permitted. Since this is a local issue, you’ll want to do your own research to see what’s happening where you live. At this point, Chicago’s ADU pilot program specifically prohibits short-term rentals permitted under the pilot program.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How much does an ADU cost?</h3>
<p class="p1">A major factor on the cost of a Chicago ADU will be based on what you have to work with. For example, are you <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converting a garage</a> with a good roof that is close to electrical and plumbing hookups? Do you have an already empty space available, or need to remove trees to make space?</p>
<p class="p1">These factors make ADUs more complex than you realize, considering they tend to be small spaces. In fact, in places where they’re legally allowed the maximum square footage is usually limited to a fixed percentage of the square footage of the main house, as mentioned above.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, the cost will depend on multiple things: your existing property, the general <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor you hire</a>, plus options like hiring an architect. Your best bet is to work with an experienced professional to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build your new Chicago ADU</a>.</p>

Either type of project will require an experienced <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/chicago-renovations/">licensed general contractor in Chicago</a> and possibly an architect to navigate the DOB, applicable local code, and careful planning. Older structures may require a great deal of complex planning and renovation. New structures attached to a main home will have electrical, plumbing, foundation, roof, and other existing components integrated between the two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></div>

Through Chicago’s ADU pilot program, homeowners can renovate an existing building into an ADU on the property of the main residence. A new structure can also be built. ADUs can be turned into rentable living spaces, or “dwelling units,” that will need a kitchen and bathroom. If built without a kitchen or bathroom, it can function as a home office or studio outside of the main house. These will cost less to create than living spaces. The pilot program does impose some regulations. For example, an existing parking space cannot be turned into an ADU, while some areas have affordable housing requirements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></div>

			<h2 class="p1">From efficient ADUs to spa-like bathrooms, home interior design in Los Angeles points to simplicity, utility, and going traditional</h2>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46811 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg" alt="bedroom remodel for actress Jaime Ray Newman los angeles" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2">Diversity is king when it comes to home interior design in Los Angeles. The city has a sense of history, with styles spanning Spanish Colonial to Mission Revival, Beaux-Arts to Art Deco, Hollywood Regency to streamline 1930s modern. The desire to preserve those design styles is strong, as is the need to make homes liveable for today. H<span>ome renovation design trends in Los Angeles</span> and what rooms and features are important have shifted nationwide. Fortunately, for LA contractors and designers, remodeling has not missed a beat.</p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Top photo</em>) Sweeten renovators and actor Jaime Ray Newman and Guy Nattiv&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles home renovation</a></span></p>
<h3>Changes and challenges: Home interior design in Los Angeles</h3>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t really see much of a change,” said Sweeten <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5968#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA general contractor Trevor</a>. “It&#8217;s just a redirect.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The challenge is more about materials shortages, delays, and rising costs</span><span class="s2">.</span> “The cost of lumber is affecting building,” said Trevor. Sheet plywood, for example, has jumped from $18 to around $50, he said. “People are asking for alternatives to lumber, like tin framing used in commercial.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">A renewed focus on outdoor living</h3>
<p class="p2">“A lot more people are fixing their exterior,” said Trevor. “People want to spend money on outdoor hardscapes, swimming pools. In LA, that’s where you spend 60 percent of your time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.cozystylishchic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA-based designer Jeanne Chung</a> agreed. “It’s all about indoor-outdoor living,” she said. NanaWalls, which fold in and extend the indoor space out to patios, are very popular. “They double the square footage of eating and entertaining areas,” said Jeanne.</p>
<p class="p2">The bonus of adding windows, especially large ones to foster the indoor/outdoor connection is gaining more natural light.</p>
<p class="p2">Homeowners are also investing in <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/outdoor-space/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outdoor rooms</a>. Pools, water features, outdoor kitchens, firepits, and extensive seating and dining areas are high on wish lists. Materials are more organic, “definitely going back to nature.” Trevor is using a lot of textured cement, stamped, and honed finishes. “A salt finish really is big. With mid-century design, there’s a lot of tile work. We do ipe wood outdoors and a type of red hardwood that is slightly less hard than ipe, but about half the price.”</p>
<h3 class="p5">ADUs and additions for more square footage</h3>
<p class="p2">One rising trend for home interior design in Los Angeles is remodeling ADUs (accessory dwelling units). “It’s generating the <span style="color: #333333;">biggest buzz,” said <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractor Trevor. </span>These detached structures, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often garages</a>, are repurposed as guest houses, rentals, or home offices.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of her clients are adding to the existing footprint. “They’re knocking out walls to create a little extra space, as in bathrooms, for example.”</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg" alt="Modern living room with glass walls and modern gray fireplace" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kirsty-House-06-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirsty and David&#8217;s</a> Mid-City/Miracle Mile home in LA</span></p>
<p class="p2">“You can build a second story,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s contingent on the footprint of the existing structure. A lot are pushed outside of the setback, so they go high vertically. People are going for the max. It’s getting a lot of value on the price for square foot.” If you&#8217;re planning on expanding or remodeling a kitchen or bathroom (more on them below), look for a vetted general contractor that is licensed. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor in LA</a> with experience will guide you through the process.</p>
<h3>Keeping kitchens fresh and updated</h3>
<p class="p6">“It’s where you get the most <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bang for the buck</a>,” said Trevor. The remodel here may happen more frequently than in other parts of the country. Apparently, design fatigue sets in earlier. He has <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned to kitchens</a> remodeled just two years before for a refresh. “It’s like changing wardrobes.”</p>
<p class="p2">LA kitchens tend to be large, mostly open plan, and gourmet with top-of-the-line professional appliances. But there’s not as much carving, ornate moldings, over-the-top use of stones. Instead, there’s more of a creative mix of materials. At the same time, the goal is more making it your own with custom looks—tile backsplashes, bold color ranges, and stove hoods.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="geometric-pattern-black-white-backsplash-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-50846 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg" alt="peninsula island in kitchen with white marble countertop and undermount sink with gold faucet and fixtures and pendant lights and black kitchen cabinets and geometric pattern black white backsplash tiles and vent over cooking range after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-Jeanne-touch-of-gold_brass-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h4>Top kitchen materials to watch</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Cabinets. Simple clean-lined styles are flat-panel and frameless. Hardware is modern, sculptural, or jewelry-like. Otherwise, there are hidden touch latches. Wood is finding competition in painted finishes, mostly in soothing livable shades.</li>
<li class="p2">Island culture. Some islands are getting bigger, some are multi-level for different functions. Waterfall sides on islands are popular.</li>
<li class="p2">Appliances. Pro-style ranges favor stylish brands like cooktops and ovens from Wolf, Monogram by GE, LaCornue, and Lacanche. The desire to cook healthy promotes features like special burners for woks, steam cooking. Some ranges even have an integrated sous vide. The slow cooking in a vacuum-sealed bag retains more nutrients, uses less oil, fat, and salt.</li>
<li class="p2">Porcelain and quartz are gaining in popularity because of the similar looks to stone without the maintenance. Large slabs and large format tiles offer a seamless installation with no grout lines to break up the design. Matte finishes have overtaken shiny ones.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">“Here in LA, my clients don’t want polished,” said Jeanne. “I am using concrete-looking porcelain slabs and cement tiles.” Jeanne seals her concrete to guard against staining because it’s pretty porous.</p>
<h4>Finishes lead the way</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Color is taking a turn. Moody, dark colors—black, deep blues, and bottle greens—are ramping up, said Sweeten contractor Trevor. They pair well with burnished or brushed gold. “I do a lot of antiqued blue—like a muted denim—with brass pulls,” he said.</li>
<li class="p2">Lighter woods seem to suit the lighter mood of interiors. That goes for cabinets as well as flooring. Wide plank wood floors are on trend—with an average of 7&#8243;—and in French oak whitewashed finishes, cappuccino, some with a hint of gray.</li>
<li class="p2">Gold touch. LA homeowners are opting more for burnished and brushed gold finishes in cabinet hardware, faucets, and lighting. Some appliance manufacturers now include brass pulls as options. But mixing gold, especially with black matte, is very chic. Mixing metals adds interest to the design, especially in kitchens, where there is a lot of cabinetry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2">The spa bath is redefined</h3>
<p class="p2">In Los Angeles, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrading the whole bathroom</a> means incorporating a level of comfort. Freestanding tubs provide a visual <i>tour de force</i>. Most often they are made of stone, porcelain, quartz, or resin, so the shape lends a sculptural note. Large curbless walk-in showers are distinguished with surface materials. Linear drains are trending because they are more aesthetically pleasing. Rain showers are favored, but you won’t find multiple showerheads due to water restrictions. Floors often are radiant heated.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" title="gray-vanity-marble-countertop-hanging-mirror" class="alignnone wp-image-50847 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg" alt="large gray single vanity with white marble countertop and brushed nickel hardware and gold faucet and fixtures and hanging circular mirror infront of window after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-Jeanne-2918-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Variations of brass finishes in this LA renovation by designer Jeanne Chung. Photos by Peter Christiansen Valli. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The divide—choosing between tub and shower—is more about personal preferences. Many see the sculptural artistry of the tub as adding to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return on investment</a>. Radiant heat is also a value-added. An alternative to slab stone walls is large-format porcelain tile. These tiles, with a range of looks that mimic various stones, come in similar slab formats.</p>
<p class="p2">More than ever, the bath is <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered an oasis</a>. The overall style may be elegant, but again, the overall look is simplified, with cleaner, more modern lines.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ensuite bedrooms are preferred to mega-size closets</h3>
<p class="p2">Jeanne said her clients would rather have larger bedrooms with sitting areas than supersized closets. Still, walk-in closets are on remodeling wish lists.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Storage is key</h3>
<p class="p2">Unseen compartments in drawers or cubbies in cabinetry and built-in benches corral stuff to keep spaces visually clean.</p>
<p class="p2"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="Modern kitchen with exposed beams and stacked washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Sweeten renovators <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Westchester home in LA</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Mudrooms are still going strong</h3>
<p class="p2">Although some trend forecasters suggest the demise of these transitional spaces for hanging coats and dropping gear, Jeanne said not so in LA. “Especially with the pandemic,” she said, “There’s a desire for bigger mudrooms. It’s like a decontamination area—coming into the home, taking off all your grimy stuff.” Typical layouts include hanging storage behind doors, cubbies, and benches for putting on shoes or boots. Some incorporate pet stations.</p>
<h3 class="p2">There’s an uptick in requests for libraries</h3>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very popular room right now,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “It’s only going to get more popular. I’ve had three customers recently tell me they want libraries—real traditional, with everything built in.”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Home offices are making a comeback</h3>
<p class="p2">The Zoom fatigue is real, but so is the realization that the backdrop for those visual calls needs to step up. Jeanne recently had a request from a wife to make her husband’s office more fashionable—because of his frequent video calls.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Ongoing remodeling trends consistent in LA</h3>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li class="p2">Going green and sustainability is much more in demand with a more conscious effort to utilize eco-friendly materials as well as those that save energy.</li>
<li class="p2">Smart home. Automation adjusts to temperature, lighting, and security. Smart devices even monitor cooking.</li>
<li class="p2">A few things to consider when remodeling in LA: <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seismic codes</a> that require tall stem walls, slab on grade with thick foundations in order to guard against earthquake damage. Also, water restriction dictates the kinds of showers allowed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Find a contractor</span></a></p>
<h3 class="p2">Classic and traditional design emerges</h3>
<p>For home interior design in Los Angeles, Trevor also said that there appears to be a return to more traditional design.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">“Mid-century modern has always been huge like ranch home designs,” he said. &#8220;But traditional design is coming back—I would call it a mix between mid-century, Dutch, and American traditional. Recently I’ve been seeing yellow and some of the 70s colors coming back.”</li>
<li class="p2">Statement decorating is hot. It’s part of the remodel plan. It could be a feature wall, a painted mural, or wallcovering. It could be a pop of color in a professional range or a graphic patterned tile on a backsplash. Outdoors, it might be a pergola, water, or fire feature.</li>
<li class="p2">There’s an appreciation for artisanal looks. Handmade tiles, handcrafted hardware lend personality to interiors. Some renovation inspiration comes from restaurant and hotel design.</li>
<li class="p2">“Simplicity—we’re definitely going in that direction,” said Sweeten contractor Trevor. “Not so much baroque-style with lots of moldings. People are going functional. They want hip and stylish.” There’s a minimalist sensibility, but not in the spare extreme.</li>
<li class="p2">California style—with a modern or rustic refined look—still is strong, with lighter bleached look woods and ceiling beams.</li>
</ul>

Creating a budget for that planned remodel is unique to every project. The materials you choose, changes in layout, or moving plumbing or gas lines, all factor into the equation.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU): Starting at <b>$50,000 </b>for a conversion and <b>$125,000+</b> for ground-up construction.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that every professional contractor will want to have a detailed conversation with you. They will also inspect your home before developing an estimate specific to your needs and wants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pro tip:</b> Do not wait! Some sectors are experiencing a backlog in the supply of materials. For L.A. homeowners interested in renovating, it’s smart to schedule and sign with a contractor to lock in your material prices. Additionally, you’ll want to book a start date on the contractor’s schedule. If you do wait, prices will only continue to go up, and your material order starts at the back of a long queue.</span></p>
<h3>Remodeling costs per square foot in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that Los Angeles is one of the pricier real estate markets in the United States. However, the housing stock in the area is fairly new. As a result, L.A. homes won’t experience behind-the-wall issues that are often found in older structures. Kitchens and baths are the most popular renovation types. Exterior upgrades and garage conversions are also on the rise to create additional living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process in a whole house</a>, on average, many of our projects can range from </span><b>$100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$400+</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf. Typically, dry rooms (i.e., living rooms and bedrooms) are cheaper to renovate than wet rooms (i.e., kitchen and baths), and is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated that while <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updating living rooms or bedrooms</a>—dry rooms—are at the lower end of the range, the wet rooms are closer to </span><b>$400</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. The prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>
<h3>Interior designer costs in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also checked in with L.A.-based</span><a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interior designer Haley Weidenbaum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how interior designers calculate fees. She explains, “Typically for renovation projects, I will charge a flat fee. This is beneficial for both designer and client. It allows the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designer to work</a> more freely and offers more transparency between the designer and the client. However, it is important for both parties to agree on a scope of work. Everyone should be on the same page and understand what is included under this flat fee.”</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles kitchen remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing for a kitchen remodel</a>, remember that California banned the running of new gas lines to any new construction—which means no gas stoves. This move is essential in the lowering of the carbon footprint. Even though buildings with existing gas lines aren’t affected, be sure to check the latest codes. If you’re looking to renovate for resale, you don’t want to invest in appliances that aren’t in compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics of storage and delivery make the cost of cabinets in L.A. less expensive than more densely populated urban areas. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a>: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><b>$24,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 200 square feet. The finishes would be budget-friendly from retailers such as Home Depot. This budget includes budget finishes, energy-efficient appliances, laminate countertops, and mid-grade sink and faucet finishes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade kitchen remodeling costs: We have seen Sweeten project costs come in at </span><b>$37,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this budget, <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refreshing a kitchen</a> can include new stock or semi-custom cabinets, appliances, and manufactured or quartz countertops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end kitchen: Projects on the higher end of the scale can start at <strong>$76,000</strong>. A large part of that cost can be in custom cabinetry. </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5589#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimate that a high-end renovation averages upwards of </span><b>$100,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles bathroom remodel costs per square foot</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget bathroom: A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget bathroom renovation</a> at 35 square feet, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, starts at </span><b>$18,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can reach </span><b>$25,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Sweeten contractors. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom in Los Angeles</a> will cost on average between </span><b>$28,500</b><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to the Cost vs. Value Report, the cost is </span><b>$849</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or <strong>$29,744</strong> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. All fixtures are replaced featuring solid-surface vanity and integrated sink, recessed medicine cabinet with light, ceramic tile floor, and a 30” x 60” tub.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end bathroom: The average cost Sweeten contractors report working on for upscale bathrooms start around </span><b>$40,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Cost vs Value Report puts a high-end bathroom renovation and expansion at </span><b>$88,491. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is based on a bathroom expanded from 35 to 100 square feet. It worked out to be </span><b>$770</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the highest budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost </span><b>$2,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per piece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. As a result, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good general contractor can work</a> with a reasonable budget and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for the bath remodel</a>.</span></p>
<h3>How much a Los Angeles master suite addition costs</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-grade master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$503</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf or </span><b>$193,390</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can build a 24’ x 16’ master suite including a walk-in closet, dressing area, freestanding tub, separate shower, and double vanity over an existing crawl space, according to Cost v. Value Report. This pricing includes carpeting in the bedroom and tile on the bathroom floor, lighting throughout, and an exhaust fan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crawl space and a raised foundation make it easier for the crew to crawl underneath the subfloor to access the rough connections. It becomes more challenging and expensive when working on a renovation with a house on a slab on grade. If fixtures are being relocated or saw cuts, trenching, and backfill are required, then these can add to the cost of the renovation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upscale master suite addition: For approximately </span><b>$606</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> psf, or </span><b>$388,427</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s possible to create a 32’ x 20’ master suite with a separate sitting area and a large master bath, also over crawl space, according to the Cost v. Value Report. This includes custom shelving and built-in storage, as well as a walk-in closet and dressing area with windows. The bath has everything that is included in a mid-grade remodel, along with stone counters and a partitioned space for a toilet. The suite also features a wet bar with microwave, sink, and refrigerator for this budget range.</span></li>

<h3>How much do Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) cost in Los Angeles?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ADU is a secondary housing unit on a single-family residential lot. They tend to be adjacent to a primary housing unit, and are usually much smaller than the average home. You can learn more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building ADUs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as the numerous new laws passed in 2016 and 2019 that are encouraging their proliferation in California by making them faster, easier, and more efficient to build.</span></p>
<h4>Existing electrical and plumbing</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractors</a> have worked on projects that range from about <strong>$50,000</strong> to over <strong>$200,000</strong>, depending on whether they are conversions or ground-up constructions. There are numerous other factors that come into play. Importantly, what you have to work with is key—are you converting an existing structure that has electrical and/or plumbing? If so, it could be a relatively affordable proposition. Sweeten contractors Anna &amp; Vahik tell us that in Los Angeles County, conversions average about <strong>$75,000</strong> while ground-up constructions start at a range between <strong>$125,000</strong> to <strong>$150,000</strong>.</span></p>
<h4>Converting garages</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specifics of an ADU conversion will cause a wide variance in the costs associated with bringing it to compliance. Some Sweeten contractors have been able to convert garages to ADUs with a <strong>$58,000 </strong>budget, which already had plumbing (sewer) and its own electrical service. Another old garage was completely converted costing about <strong>$196,000</strong>. </span></p>
<h3>Costs for remodeling permits in Los Angeles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Los Angeles. However, typically the cost will be determined by your budget and require a bit of high school math to figure out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sweeten contractors in L.A., this number varies between an estimated </span><b>$750</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$2,500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the specific scope of work for each project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik explains, “Permit costs vary for different neighborhoods. Average kitchen and bath remodels (“express permits”) with no structural changes or layout changes cost around </span><b>$500</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><b>$1,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bigger projects such as additions, remodels with structural changes, or exterior work that need plan changes start at </span><b>$5,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can go up to </span><b>$20,000</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in cities like Santa Monica.”</span></p>

<p>At Sweeten, we’re here to help you flip that underutilized garage into one of the best rooms in the house or perhaps an income-generating unit. Before you take on turning a garage into living space, like a home gym or guest house, there are things to consider. Does the space have proper insulation?</p>

<h3>Garage remodel ideas</h3>
<p>Anything. Really! Garages have been converted into gyms, personal getaway space, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-contained studio apartments</a>, and home bars, according to Sweeten general contractor Michael. “It’s found space, so get creative,” Michael said.</p>

<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) With Sweeten&#8217;s help, a 150-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-connecticut-garage-renovation-creates-an-art-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage remodel</a> in Connecticut became a ceramics studio</span></p>
<h3>Should you trade in car storage space for a garage remodel?</h3>
<p class="p3">While some people are giving up their car’s indoor space altogether, others are slicing their garage in half, said Michael. This leaves room for at least one car, and the rest of the space becomes something else. “That way you can still have a garage when you sell your house,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">Michael believes the jury is still out on if the property value increases whether the garage is converted or not. Some Sweeten contractors believe a garage is much more valuable as a living space for the homeowner and for resale purposes. <a href="https://budgeting.thenest.com/making-room-garage-affect-home-value-31778.html"><span class="s2">Reports indicate that a home&#8217;s</span></a> value could increase by as much as six percent, but that’s only if the area has ample street parking. Taking away your garage and off-street parking in a high-density area could bring that value down.</p>
<p class="p3">However, some towns might require at least one car space on your property and potentially two in some areas, Michael said. This could mean slotting your car into an outdoor area somewhere else in your front yard. “Do your homework,” Michael said. More on zoning and permits below.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to convert a garage into living space?</h3>
<p class="p3">Budgets for a garage renovation can vary greatly depending on many factors including the state of your garage, your intended use, and the types of materials you want to use. To get an accurate read on your budgets, it’s always best to sit down with a general contractor who can tailor a quote for your situation.</p>
<p class="p3">Converting a garage is a good-value strategy to add living space to your home, costing <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/money/real-estate/2017/02/10/renovating-garage-less-costly-option-than-addition/97742930/"><span class="s2">$30 a square foot</span></a> which is less than an extension, according to NorthJersey.com. Sweeten contractor Michael puts the average range of a garage conversion in the tri-state area between $35,000 and $60,000. “But I’ve seen upwards of $100,000,” he said.</p>
<p class="p3">The fit-out for a garage conversion shouldn’t cost more than $45,000 to make the space comfortable, Michael said. That includes plumbing for a toilet, insulation, and heating. However, “A lot of people are putting in bars and fridges, some cooking equipment, or cool decorative wall paneling,” he said. These are just a few examples of what can bump up the price tag.</p>
<p class="p3">A basic garage conversion project that another Sweeten contractor has worked on came in at $25,000. The homeowner wanted an art studio. To handle the new 25 lighting fixtures—art studios need a lot of light—the space required an electrical upgrade including a new breaker box. Insulation was also required so it was comfortable during the fall, spring, and summer. A heater was added for the winter.</p>
<p class="p3">For a $60,000 project in rural New Jersey, a homeowner wanted to add a fully self-contained apartment to the second story of their garage. That meant adding a kitchen and bathroom, which pushes up a budget substantially. Plumbing, electrical, an interior and exterior overhaul as well as reinforcing the exterior stairs were part of the remodel.</p>
<p class="p3">The budget might seem big, but it was an income-generating investment bringing in rental income at $1,400 a month.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg" alt="Garage remodel in los angeles with sofa and office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52349 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/45772-Saima-Garage-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Saima and Tom&#8217;s Sweeten contractor completed their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage conversion in Los Angeles</a></span></p>
<h3>What are the conditions of the garage?</h3>
<p class="p3">Sometimes, you&#8217;ll need to clear those spaces out from junk and any animal tenants. Many underutilized garages, especially standalone structures, may have experienced neglect for a period of time.</p>
<p class="p3">Whether a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/derelict-garage-finds-purpose-she-shed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stand-alone garage is structurally sound</a> will also be a question. This will take on additional importance if you’re renovating or adding a second story.</p>
<p class="p3">Garages can also have random and awkwardly placed columns disrupting the open space, or a ceiling height that isn’t conducive to taller guests. And most floors will be on a pitch so water can run right off it, according to Michael. These are the types of problems that might require a creative solution if you’re going to convert your garage into a living space.</p>
<h3>Consider: Insulation and heating a garage remodel</h3>
<p class="p3">Most garages lack insulation. Consequently, it probably won&#8217;t have heating; so consider what you want to use the space for. If it will be used just for the summer, adding some fans can offer a budget-conscious idea.</p>
<p class="p3">If you’re intending to use it all or most of the year, you will likely need to add insulation and heating in your garage conversion. Typically, garages are made of concrete blocks, so they tend to be very cold. However, a garage that is within your home might have some insulation on any wall or part of the ceiling that connects to the main house.</p>
<p class="p3">Giving the room its own heat source will cost up to $6,000. Keep in mind that a heat pump might require an electrical upgrade. “You can take an existing heat system in the house and blow it into the garage,” said Michael, of one possible solution.</p>
<p class="p3">The floor of a garage is typically concrete and a big source of heat loss. Adding insulation might be necessary. If that’s the case, you will need to dig down or elevate the floor if your ceiling height allows for that, Michael said.</p>
<h3>Zoning and permits needed to convert a garage into living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Unfortunately, zoning rules can get in the way of a garage conversion. This is because changing the use of your garage can be a big deal for some building departments. “Some zoning codes prohibit adding a loft or a second story,” said Michael. The best way forward is to talk with your general contractor to find out what rules your local area might have.</p>
<p class="p3">According to Sweeten contractors, the cost of permits will also change from area to area with a range from a few hundred dollars up to <span class="s2">$1,500</span> if you need permits for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3">“Home Owners Associations often frown on these conversions,” Michael added. That’s because you will be taking away a car (or two) which might have been a vital part of that development’s original approval he said. If your home comes under an HOA, make sure to check their rules! It&#8217;s also wise to check the zoning and permitting restrictions in your area.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask when turning a garage into a living space</h3>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, homeowners interested in turning a garage into a living space should do some soul searching first. How much will it improve your quality of life? Will you rent it? How will it impact your property’s value? For many, a garage is worth more as a living space than it is as car storage. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to get started on your garage or home remodel, work with Sweeten to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">renovate with the best contractors</span></a>.</span></p>

<h3>Deciding to renovate during COVID</h3>
<p>What do you do when a global pandemic hits in the middle of your home remodel—just as you’ve moved out of your house, with two babies under two years old in tow, to make way for the construction crew? Jaime Ray Newman washed her hands and pushed on.</p>
<div></div>

<p>“We were juggling a lot,” said the actor and producer, who had posted her project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> in 2019 for the dream redo of her 1936 ranch home. “We were expecting our second baby. It was now or never to blow open and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redo the house</a>.” The Sweeten post stated a desire to “convert our old 1930s two-car <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage to ADU</a>,” also known as an accessory dwelling unit, (also known as a working studio, guest apartment, or multitasking hybrid.)</p>
<p>Jaime also hoped to do a space-reclaiming opening of her family’s living space. She shares it with her life and business partner Guy Nattiv, a filmmaker (they co-founded New Native Pictures and won an Academy for &#8220;SKIN&#8221;), their daughters Alma and soon-to-be Mila, and their dog, Kiwi. The project had been on her To-Do list forever.</p>

<p>“We’d been wanting to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert our garage since day one</a>,” Jaime said, “but had struggled with the permitting situation.” The area where they live in L.A. required single-family homes to have two-space covered parking. When the law changed, Jaime recalled, “We said, Let’s do this.” They decided to renovate the house at the same time. “We realized that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan, and a real closet and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary bath</a> for ourselves,” she said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46473 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg" alt="Jaime Newman" width="1000" height="1374" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-218x300.jpg 218w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-16-600x824.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The home &amp; garage renovation team takes shape</h3>
<p>Jaime, whose work includes winning an Oscar as a producer, playing a recurring character Elizabeth Manwill in Hulu’s <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> miniseries, as well as an essential district attorney role in Fox&#8217;s <em>Deputy</em>, had already gathered a reno dream team. “I bribed our dear friend Marcos Ferraez, a total visionary when it comes to imagining and reconfiguring a space, to come over and walk through the house,” she said. “We thought we needed to blow out the back of the house and add square footage, but we didn’t have the budget. I was stumped. Marcos completely reimagined our home within our current square footage.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going. But we were in desperate need of an office&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/what-to-know-when-building-an-adu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garage space</a> was next. Jaime hired <a href="https://www.haleyweidenbaum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designer Haley Weidenbaum</a> to conceive of the layout and was stunned by Haley’s ability to maximize every square inch of the available 350 square feet. Haley also had a vision for the main living space, designing the primary bedroom and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. “Her talent and advice were invaluable,” Jaime said. From there she got on Sweeten and found her general contractor.</p>

<h3>Keeping family together during COVID</h3>
<p>Jaime was pretty clear on what she wanted. “I met with <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple contractors</a>. What I liked most about the one we hired was that he had style. His taste was always on point,” she said. “He was also <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very reasonable, and confident</a>.”</p>
<p>Like most of the world, the family had no idea of the uncertainty that lay ahead. For Jaime, in particular, early 2020 packed a punch. The COVID-19 threat loomed over the U.S. and then, she said, “my dad passed away in February.” Jaime wanted to support her mother and stay close by. It added up to difficult timing. “Everyone thought I was crazy to keep going,” she said. “But we were in desperate need of an office, and a separate space away from the kids so we could get work done,” Jaime said.</p>
<h3>Two designers for a Los Angeles garage remodel</h3>
<p>The project seemed to thrive on flux and change. “I realized at one point that much of our furniture no longer worked with the space, so we sold a lot of stuff on Facebook Marketplace to make room for new things,” she said. When Haley, who had started EVERHEM, a window-treatment company, got too busy and had to step away from the project, they brought in another designer.</p>

<p>“I have always had an Instagram crush on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelynnfurlong/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design consultant Madelynn Furlong</a>,” Jaime said. “I asked if she’d be game to take us to the finish line and re-think the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design of the house</a>. Her aesthetic is unique and she finds the most interesting pieces.” Through Madelynn, Jaime discovered amazing companies like Muuto, Industry West, Lulu and Georgia, Constance Guisset, and Hudson Valley Lighting, among others. And the designer knew how to find one-of-a-kinds.</p>
<p>“Madelynn sent me a link to a giant, vintage burl wood dining table on Chairish for a terrific price, and said “BUY THIS NOW,” Jaime remembers. “It weighs 600 pounds. When it arrived, the household was blown away. This work of art will be passed down to my kids!”</p>

<p>Collaborating with two designers with very different feels was the most fun and satisfying part of the process, according to Jaime. Through them (and Pinterest), she found the original pieces and touches she wanted to make the space her own. Especially bath and kitchen design ideas. “I wanted something fun for our kitchen backsplash and I’m obsessed with Fireclay Tile, so that was easy! The bathroom floor needed to be non-slip, so we picked a slate from Clé Tile that we loved. I also fell head over heels for a hexagon tile from Popham Design.</p>

<h3>What does renovating feel like?</h3>
<p>Asked about a renovator’s most important virtue, Jaime chose patience. The process is long, she said, but your memory is short once you are settled in. “It’s kind of like after having your first baby!” the actor jokes. Confidence is also key, she said. These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts. And <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a contractor</a> whose aesthetic you love.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad we lived in the house for years before renovating it, so we understood our needs and how best to accommodate them within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our budget</a>,” Jaime said. Especially now, during COVID, she says, “We are in pure bliss here. The house is unique, but warm and inviting, a family compound and a comfortable respite. I cannot wait until we can have guests over!”</p>

			<h2>The case for Accessory Dwelling Units, how to build one, and how much it will cost in Los Angeles</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41232 size-full" title="ADU" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2.jpg" alt="ADU" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ADU-Image-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the hottest properties in Los Angeles real estate right now is the ADU (or Accessory Dwelling Unit). These small and often self-contained units on lots with single-family homes, whether built from scratch or transforming an <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/garage/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underused garage</a>, are reimagined as in-law spaces (aka the granny flat), short-term rental units, home offices, private yoga studios, and more. Here&#8217;s our <span>guide to building ADUs in Los Angeles</span> with insight from <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten’s</a> L.A. general contractors.</p>
<h3>An ADU’s wide-ranging potential</h3>
<p>Additionally, ADUs have the potential to increase property values and generate income for homeowners while providing a solution to L.A.’s housing shortage. “If you’re thinking about a long-term strategy to offset the cost of your house or renovation,” says Sweeten founder and CEO Jean Brownhill. “ADUs can provide a potential revenue stream in terms of rental space.”</p>
<p>While many Angelenos are incorporating <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchens into their ADUs</a>, others don&#8217;t include them to keep the project simple. A minimum price tag can build a private gym or office. “More people are working from home, so having a workspace that is separate from the home is a big advantage,” said Sweeten architect Jordan.</p>
<p>These units can either be attached to the main residence by adding a self-contained unit and another entrance or detached, as a completely separate structure to the house. Homeowners have <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/adu-and-garage-renovations/a-los-angeles-garage-remodel-with-loft-like-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converted their garages</a> or pool houses into ADUs or built a second story on the garage to accommodate an ADU. In other words, there are many ways to interpret what an ADU can look like for your property.</p>
<h3>Who can build an ADU on their property?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In LA, many homes have spacious lots that could easily accommodate another small structure. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill #9, aka SB-9, removes the density and zoning restrictions that previously prevented Angelinos from adding an ADU to their property.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, an ADU project was permitted on a case-by-case basis, so not every Angelino qualified. Now, each lot automatically qualifies unless there is a specific issue with the lot that prevents building, like a flood plain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB-9 allows qualifying single-family residences to contain two separate residences on a lot zoned for single-family homes as long as the minimum setbacks are observed. However, to be certain, it is best to consult with an architect and general contractor who are familiar with your area. They should also be </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up-to-date on the codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regulations for ADUs. If you need the services of an architect, they can design and help optimize the use of your ADU. Your Sweeten general contractor will execute the architect’s plan. Your renovation team will help you obtain the necessary permits and approvals.</span></p>

<h3>How do I finance an ADU in Los Angeles?</h3>
<p>Due to the popularity of ADUs in LA, financing options have evolved. Before SB-9, most ADU projects were financed using traditional financing like a HELOC or home equity loan. These options often required a substantial downpayment, often 20% or more.</p>
<p>Today, innovative strategies like home share agreements are widely available if your property qualifies. By design, these financing options are more flexible than traditional financing sources. Some allow you to sell a percentage of your ownership in the property while you remain in the home. In some agreements, you only repay the funds when you sell the property.</p>
<p>If you have the resources, another option is to fund the project with cash and then refinance the entire property with a new first mortgage.</p>
<h3>How does an ADU receive water and electricity services?</h3>
<p>If your ADU will be detached from the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main home</a>, you may still be able to share services like electrical connections and the water supply. However, the connections will need to be resized to accommodate the additional demands from the ADU.</p>
<p>Water, HVAC, and electrical infrastructure usually represent about half of the total cost of a remodel. Adding to these existing systems is often less expensive than starting from scratch, but they will require modification.</p>
<p>You can also have new services installed if you need to keep expenses separate, like for a rental property. This option will be the most expensive on the front end because new meters are installed and new trenches dug.</p>
<h4>Building around earthquakes and hillsides</h4>
<p>And even though ADUs are small, Title 24, which covers energy conservation and green design, still applies as does seismic standards for earthquakes, architect Jordan said. It is possible to build an Accessory Dwelling Unit on a hillside in Los Angeles, but it may be subject to additional regulations and requirements. Hillside areas in Los Angeles are typically subject to more stringent zoning and building regulations.</p>
<h3>How much does an ADU cost?</h3>
<p>Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractors</a> have worked on projects that range from about $50,000 to over $200,000, with plenty in between. A major factor of how much your ADU will cost will be based on what you have to work with. For example, are you converting a garage that is close to electrical and plumbing hookups? The cost increases with additional bells and whistles you may want.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5716#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten LA contractor Netanel</a> worked on a garage conversion costing $50,000 and was completed in less than three months. “The owners used the existing floor so they didn’t need to do as much to the interior,” he said, adding that the connection for the plumbing was close by, further lowering the cost.</p>
<p>If you are planning a garage conversion, the state of your garage will play a big factor in project cost. Is there drywall? Are there any utilities? If there are, do they need to be upgraded to support a fully-contained unit? Does the roof need replacing? “A garage isn’t always something that homeowners focus on because it housed their car,” explained Jordan.</p>
<p>Another client of Netanel’s went for a higher-end ADU, which cost well over $100,000. The walls needed to be fully insulated with plumbing and electrical connected. It also had some luxe elements like marble floors and walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, a free-standing tub, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> for the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the style and finish of the original home on the property. “If the original house is a high-end property, then the ADU has to correspond,”  said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5589#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractors Anna and Vahik</a>, who are based in Los Angeles.</p>

<h3>An ADU cost breakdown​​</h3>
<p>Here’s an estimate for an ADU project in Los Angeles for $88,560. The goal was to convert an attached garage into a living space for a relative. Note that the mechanical (HVAC), electrical, and plumbing work represents about 40% of the total project cost. This is why controlling the size and scope of your project is important to staying on budget.</p>
<p>We’ve separated the project expenses into the main categories. The ADU’s systems and drywall were the largest expenses, followed by framing, flooring, and doors/windows. The miscellaneous expenses accounted for about 15% of the total.</p>
<h3>Plumbing ($20,000)</h3>
<p>This project required new underground plumbing for the ADU. New trenches, pipes, and rough-in plumbing were required. New rough-in connections were included for the existing <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen</a> as well. The price included <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing new fixtures</a>, sinks, and toilets.</p>
<h3>Electrical and Lighting ($10,340)</h3>
<p>The ADU required a 100 amp subpanel, as well as Arc-fault circuit breakers. New lighting and outlet circuits were also included. A new circuit was provided for a new water heater and another one was added for a new dryer.</p>
<h3>HVAC ($15,000)</h3>
<p>The ADU required its own 2-ton HVAC package unit and six new registers. The addition of the new registers affected the framing, so the estimate included a 10% buffer to cover any necessary framing changes.</p>
<h3>Drywall and Insulation ($11,500 + $2,647 = $14,147)</h3>
<p>The remodel required R-38 insulation in the ceiling and R-13 insulation ($2,647) in the walls. The drywall ($11,500) was hung, taped, and finished with a Sante Fe-style texture. The windows and outside corners were finished with square corner bead, which is an upgrade.</p>
<h3>Flooring ($4,000)</h3>
<p>This was the price to refinish an existing concrete floor. The floor was scraped and sanded, then finished with a stain and sealer.</p>
<h3>Doors and Windows ($4,500)</h3>
<p>An existing exterior patio door opening was enlarged to install a new French door. All of the other interior doors were replaced as well. All of the original aluminum windows were exchanged with low-e vinyl replacement windows.</p>
<p>In this case, there will be monthly energy savings because the existing doors and windows were upgraded to energy-efficient models.</p>
<h3>Framing ($7,175)</h3>
<p>The interior support framing was changed to allow for the installation of new fixtures. The framing and foundation were also modified to accept the new wider French door.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parking &amp; ADUs</span></h4>
<p>Rules governing mandatory off-street parking, a major hurdle for potential ADUs, were also relaxed. Now, on-site parking is not required if the property is within a half-mile of a bus or train station, or if it is located within one block of a car-share vehicle, according to <em>CityLab</em>’s <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58e4e9705016e194dd5cdc43/t/59b33bc749fc2b50d07ec8ed/1504918476849/09-05+_+ADU+Booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> to building an ADU.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making older ADUs legal</span></h4>
<p>At the beginning of 2019, the state of California passed another ADU-friendly law. Those homeowners who illegally built ADUs without permits now have the opportunity to make it right without penalty. As an added bonus, the illegal ADU will be measured against the building standards that were in effect at the time the structure was built. These statewide laws were either adopted by L.A. counties or modified by certain municipalities, so make sure you check out what it means for your property.</p>
<p>“The state made a mandate that every building department had to come up with their own streamlined process for approving these projects,” Jordan said. “It needed to be easier than permits for building a new house or a major addition.”</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions about ADUs</h3>
<h4><b>What does ADU stand for?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADU stands for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessory Dwelling Unit. This is a housing or living unit separate from the house, but it is on the same property as the single-family home. </span></p>
<h4><b>What is an ADU?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADUs are single-space structures that are often used as an office space, an extra bedroom, or a living area. Some ADUs are used as in-law suites, others are unused garages. ADUs can also be built from scratch. ADUs can be used as rentals for people looking for a long-term or short-term stay, which provides the homeowners with bonus income, and can increase property value.</span></p>
<h4><b>How much does it cost to build an ADU?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten projects involving renovating or adding an ADU have ranged from $50,000-$200,000. General contractors have noted that the cost all depends on the changes or additions that are being made. For example, if plumbing work is being done, it will increase your costs significantly. Plus, all of the shiny features that homeowners may want will make the price higher as well. </span></p>
