<h3 class="p3">Purchasing the right Brooklyn brownstone</h3>
<p>Isis, a brand and experiential marketing specialist, and Stephano, a nurse anesthetist, closed on their brownstone home at the end of 2018. It was a fixer-upper, with four floors comprising of a 3-story apartment for the family and a garden-level rental unit. Renovating the bathroom topped their priority list at first, but had to be postponed. “We’d gutted it but weren’t able to immediately redo it,” Isis said, “because we had to prioritize repairs to the roof and work on the downstairs unit.” With two kids and a third on the way, they were not excited about putting off the bathroom—a job that included expanding it to accommodate their growing family and a new laundry space.</p>
<div><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-05" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50864" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-05.jpg" alt="Double sink vanity with the view of the barn door and shower area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<h3 class="p3">How much, and how long?</h3>
<p class="p3">During the nearly two years that followed, the family muddled through. “We had everyone sharing one bathroom,” Stephano said—including, at times, Isis’s dad. When they finally had the time and resources to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undertake the bathroom remodel</a>, they posted it on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and were quickly introduced to several <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified Brooklyn contractors</a>.</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-08" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08.jpg" alt="Large white double sink with bathroom mirror and closed vanity after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50871" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12.jpg" alt="White hexogan wall tiles with vanity and sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p3">“The biggest questions we had were how much and how long,” Isis recalled, explaining that they’d heard horror stories of inflamed budgets and endless timeline extensions. They also tried to ascertain how well each of the candidates could communicate. “We hoped to work with a team that could convey all key info that might affect the timeline,&#8221; Isis said, &#8220;so that we could collaborate on workarounds.”</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="black-faucets-fixtures-in-white-bathroom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50870" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11.jpg" alt="white honeycomb or hexagon wall tiles and white marble on vanity with black faucet and fixtures after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-11-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p3">Isis was relieved that Sweeten could smooth the process. “The company helped us gut-check our initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget based on the market</a> for our area,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They presented solid contractors for us to meet, and then checked in to make sure we felt pleased with our selection. I felt good about the consultant who supported us and the insights she shared.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">Measure twice, cut once</h3>
<p class="p3">Once they had made their contractor choice, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process for the bathroom</a> began—haltingly. Isis and Stephano had hired an independent designer, and brought the resulting plans to the table when discussing the project with their contractor. “The designer had measured, provided renderings, and even put us in touch with vendors,” Stephano said. They ordered many of the materials for the bathroom, included a barn door for the washer/dryer, a vanity, and stone for the two-sink top. Then—a hard stop. “Our contractor realized that many of the measurements didn’t jibe,” Stephano said.</p>

<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-07" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50866" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07.jpg" alt="All black shower area with built in wall shelf and black bathroom fitting after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>The original washer and dryer, left behind by the previous owners, wouldn’t fit in the space the designer had planned for it. The vanity size was also off, and the door from the recommended vendor was too heavy to be installed as intended. “It wasn’t the best experience,” Isis said. But the couple persisted, fueled by their vision: a  <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional space for laundry</a>, and a shower lit by the morning sun through a skylight. And their Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor found solutions</a> to each of the problems created by the ill-chosen designer. Stephano offered his own solution to the barn door problem: he&#8217;d use his skills to build his own custom design, and worked with the contractor to incorporate it.</p>
<h3>Borrowing space to get a bigger bathroom</h3>
<p>To accommodate the whole family, and the laundry area, they knocked down an adjacent wall and annexed a pair of closets. One closet was <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/washer-dryer-bathroom-renovation-dumbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuilt to house the washer and dryer</a>—a pair of 24-inch stacking units to replace the original ones that didn&#8217;t match the designer&#8217;s drawings. Finding a creative way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporate the units into the bathroom</a>, Stephano said, “took amazing Tetris skills” on the part of their contractor. The enlarged space helped with other layout and storage challenges. “The shower is spacious! We added a custom cabinet that can hold all of our toiletry needs and were able to obtain a larger, double-sink vanity,” Isis said.</p>
<p>For finishes they chose a combination of black, white, and natural wood, with contrasting hex tiles and subway tiles. “Subway tile felt very NYC to us, so we led with that, but also liked hexagon tile for the floor,” Isis said. “In the shower, we opted for all black, which we totally love, and we’re happy with the custom walnut shelving, too.”</p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-09" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50868" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09.jpg" alt="Open natural wood cabinet with toiletry and white hexogan wall tiles after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><img decoding="async" title="69496-Isis-Bath-10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50869" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-10.jpg" alt="Walnut shelving cabinet with black knobs and toiletry after renovation" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-10.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/69496-Isis-Bath-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<h3 class="p6">Their general contractor was a great fit</h3>
<p class="p3">Both partners feel proud of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting their bathroom project</a> and the final outcome. “We took what we’d learned from other projects,” Isis said, “and used that knowledge to work really well with our Sweeten contractor and his team.” Stephano appreciated that their contractor was always available, “and was invested in both getting the work done and making sure we were satisfied.”</p>
<p class="p3">“I love the design, and how functional it is for all of our needs, including storage,” Isis said. &#8220;Thanks to the skylight, the bathroom has great natural light. She added, “I love the custom door Stephano made for us!” Perfectly weighted, and smooth-rolling.</p>

<h3>Learning to navigate a New York renovation</h3>
<p>A first—and obvious—lesson in renovating: it really is harder in New York. When my husband Chris and I embarked on this adventure, we thought we knew what we were doing. After all, we’d undertaken a remodel of our 1914 Seattle condo before. But that was all before we decamped to New York for work—and learned what a reno here really takes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our real estate agent brought us to a 1929 building we would have never come to on our own, smack next to the construction zone that is Hudson Yards. I was hesitant, but Chris saw a decent amount of space and a good layout in a developing neighborhood.</span></p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving in, we wanted to redo the kitchen, but the most urgent fix was the bathroom. An old leak from above had unmoored a section of tile, and the previous owner refused to repair it as a condition of closing. This was our first lesson in how different a Seattle and New York renovation could be.</span></p>
<h3>Deciding to do the larger renovation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foray into a standalone bathroom remodel ended early—we got as far as finishing the design when the co-op came back with a series of unexpected plumbing requirements, chock full of things we’d never heard of like water hammer arrestors and Laticrete. The price nearly doubled, and if we were going to spend much more on a remodel, we decided we should save up and do the larger apartment renovation we had hoped to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regular re-spackling, we figured we could buy time while we saved up. That folly ended a year and a half later when, hours before leaving for vacation, a precarious section of tile came crashing down. Our super covered the crumbling wall with a plastic tarp, but it was clear: it was time to begin bidding.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right general contractor with multiple skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t sure exactly what we needed—walls weren’t moving, but our co-op required an architect. So while we asked the initial bathroom contractor to bid, we also thankfully posted our project on Sweeten. To complete our renovation, Sweeten paired us with a design-build firm with architecture training. They also did custom millwork, making it the perfect fit for our project. Not only did the general contractor immediately understand our aesthetic, but we also had a great rapport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="lead-gray-kitchen-cabinet-hardwood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48627" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-21.gif" alt="Lead gray kitchen cabinet and open refrigerator and hardwood floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In planning the remodel, we knew we wanted to play off the building’s modest Art Deco bones, but in a way that wasn’t slavish or theme-y. We also both brought mild obsessions to the mix—for me, an inexplicable passion for English cabinetry, for Chris, a desire to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">put a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/banquettes-seating-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen banquette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in every possible corner.</span></p>
<h3>Reworking the kitchen layout</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first big choice was how to manage the kitchen layout. The room was spacious enough—designed as an eat-in when 24” of counter space seemed ample—but the two doorways weren’t in an ideal location. One opened onto the foyer and the other onto a back hallway by the bedroom. It had also been poorly updated in the intervening years: half of the footprint was wasted, with a lonely refrigerator in one corner and an errant desk in another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="gray-kitchen-cabinets-wood-floor" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48614" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg" alt="Custom gray kitchen cabinets on dark oak wood flooring and foyer with bookcase after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the gas riser dashed our hopes of moving the entry to adjoin the living room, so our contractor suggested closing the smaller opening to create a wide galley with room for a banquette. This would extend the cabinetry the length of the room on one side, doubling the counter space and creating room for a wine fridge and pantry to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we played with centering the sink and range on the counter runs, our Sweeten contractor advised against it to preserve prep space. In hindsight, we were happy to have lived in the space before renovating: symmetry looked better on paper, but from experience cooking in the space, we knew her recommendation would be more functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the room from feeling enclosed, we substituted upper cabinets for extra-long open shelves on one side, then tucked in under-cabinet lighting for function. The banquette capped off the space, creating both more storage and a place for friends to hang out while cooking.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Giving the foyer a purpose </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our foyer situation was a classic New York City conundrum: too small to do much of anything useful but large enough to be wasted if empty. We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8” deep and it holds loads more than we expected. On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar. There’s just enough depth to squeeze in double rows of liquor bottles and glasses, saving precious room in the kitchen. We ran new electrical to hang art lights over tall mirrors—the goal was to make the whole space pull triple duty as an entryway, a library, and a bar—then painted the foyer and kitchen cabinetry the same deep gray so that the two spaces relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-ceiling-white-subway-tiles" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48619 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg" alt="Black ceiling with white subway tiles in bathroom with white tub and shower glass and white hex floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">A renewed bathroom in classic black-and-white</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the bathroom, we preserved and refinished an original tub and stuck to a classic black-and-white New York-inspired scheme with updated finishes. Given the narrow layout, the primary play here would be with subtle geometries—and taking advantage of our building’s extra thick walls. A hex marble floor worked well with the warmer white subway tile and porcelain. Our contractor recommended extending the floor tile onto the base of the walls to stretch the visual plane of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hexagon echoed in new shower controls that help tame the notorious temperature fluctuations that come with living in an old building. In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite thing of all is the towel warmer which took forever to source but that I deeply love for its hex bars and Anglophilic appeal. The contractor placed it in a deep niche so that the warm rails wouldn’t risk singeing passersby. We decided to paint the walls and ceiling in a black high sheen that makes the ceiling recede and the white surfaces gleam. Strangely, of all the things in the apartment, the shower glass proved one of the most frustrating: it wasn’t installed until five months after everything else wrapped up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="black-white-kitchen-wall-sconces" class="alignnone wp-image-48624 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg" alt="Black and white kitchen with wall sconces and shower glass after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Finding the budget for hardwood floors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New wood floors were the most unexpected part of the reno. We had only budgeted for the kitchen alone. But the more floor options we looked at—and after our contractor dissuaded us from several temptations like Moroccan Bejmat tile—the more we wanted hardwood in the kitchen. That meant either putting down maple boards to match the rest of the apartment—despite disliking their color—or redoing everything. Our contractor’s opinion was that changing the kitchen floors would make one of the biggest impacts in the space. So a month into the renovation, after all the other demo was done, we raided a savings account and scrambled to add herringbone floors to the scope. The late choice delayed the project by a month, but it was one of the best decisions we made.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;">Becoming comfortable with flexibility </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping back from it now, our major lesson was in developing a deep comfort with flexibility. We found that we could be much more controlling of our remodel in Seattle than here. New York’s interminable series of permits, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-op requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and engineering reports—paired with the inelasticity of old spaces—meant we had to take a go-with-the-flow approach that made trust and an ability to laugh key. Also, best to know exactly what you’re looking for before you start to remodel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractor taught us the biggest lesson of all: do it all at once if you can. It’s not the disruption that’s the problem, really, or that rework ends up costing more—it’s that few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite learn this last lesson in time. During our reno, our bedroom became the storage unit for our furniture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than anything else, we were lucky to have a real partnership with our Sweeten general contractor to see us through the changes and warn us off of bad choices. We feel a bit like we’ve earned our honorary New Yorker stripes: we chose a space that we thought was a diamond in the rough and hoped we could turn it into a classic city respite. We feel like—at least to our taste—we got there, and now we have this lovely, large-living one-bedroom to come home to in one of the most dynamic parts of Manhattan.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thinking of designing a black and white bathroom? Here&#8217;s proof they’re not all same.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to bathroom design, there’s no combination more iconic than black and white. The traditional pairing can be executed in many ways, from tile to fixtures, in a range of textures and patterns. While a black and white bathroom is a common choice, renovators can take many approaches to reflect their personal tastes. See how these homeowners, who worked with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, got the black and white bathroom of their dreams.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Tile and Grout</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33913 size-full" title="white-bathroom-subway-tiles-deep-tub" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg" alt="white bathroom with subway tiles and deep tub and shower curtains after renovation" width="1000" height="1499" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN_PallaviKitchenBath-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-pallavi-keyurs-murray-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pallavi and Keyur</a> had a black and white palette in mind when they envisioned their renovation. The final execution is on point, thanks to a thoughtful mix of tile and grout colors. The shower-bath wall features long white tiles offset with a darker grout. On the other hand, the bath siding provides a welcome inverse effect. The siding features smaller black ceramic with white grout. The natural-wood vanity brings warmth and contrast to the black and white bathroom.</p>
<h3>2. Statement floor tile in a black and white bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25234 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="black and white bathroom, renovation, home, design, construction" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>A last-minute addition proved a good decision in <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/75-year-old-hall-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Ann and Frank’s renovation</a>. Their hallway guest bath took a traditional route with the old-fashioned sink, glass walk-in shower, and subway-tile bath. It was the fun graphic floor tile that brought an unexpected contemporary touch.</p>
<h3>3. Classic Color Blocking</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02.webp" alt="This bathroom uses black and white tile to create a classic, yet modern bathroom design" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-57238 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9735-Lindsay-Apt-02-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you didn’t know it was renovated, you’d think <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/art-deco-apartment-washing-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay and Nicholas’ bathroom</a> is all original. The quintessential black and white bathroom features full-tiled white walls with slim black chair-rail accent tiles. The flooring is visually anchored with matte black hexagonal tile.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Pops of Black</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24012 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="This mostly white bathroom uses black accents to create a clean, bright and modern design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A leak made <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/bathroom-remodel-uber-chic-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie and Lance’s</a> bathroom remodel an urgent matter. As a result, their focus leaned toward function over aesthetics. They pared down their original vision of intricate floor tiles and a teak vanity. However, the final result looked like anything but an afterthought. The couple chose to create a mostly-white bathroom with small pops of black from hardware and accessories. The result feels completely effortless and relaxing.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5. Fun Florals</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27199 size-full" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="This bathroom also features a pop of light pink to create a unique design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-01-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy and Aram</a> were required to stick with the existing footprint of their bathroom. As a result, they opted to change all their fixtures and room details. For the tile, they mingled textures. The couple chose a circular dark gray-and-white tile for the shower, a floral-like motif for the floor, and a standard white subway wall tile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen and Ben, first time buyers in Brooklyn&#8217;s Kensington neighborhood, came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> with their renovation sights set on the kitchen of their 1963 co-op. They bought the two bed, two bath apartment in 2014 and were all geared up to re-do the kitchen when a week away on vacation gave them pause. They thought about how the kitchen was central to the apartment&#8217;s flow, how it would be a big project to take on, and how much pressure they felt to get everything right in such a hard-working room. Maybe they needed a little more time to live in the new place and decide what they really wanted? Maybe the bathrooms would be a more manageable starting point?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="bathroom-with-contemporary-vanity-and-toilet" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47839" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-4.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with recessed shelves and half glass wall and vanity with round vessel sink and mirrored medicine cabinet and contemporary toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;Our Sweeten contractor has been amazing &#8211; he has a daughter who is the same age as ours, and he just got it. The quality of the work is phenomenal, and he was very patient and helpful with our decisions.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em><strong>&#8212; Ellen, Kensington homeowner</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-13453"></span>Ellen, a graphic designer, and Ben, who works in software for the financial services industry, came back to update their project with a new focus: modernize the dated and uninspiring master bath. Ellen added an extra flourish to give us a sense of their urgency &#8211; in her otherwise succinct <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project post</a>, she noted that &#8220;the toothbrush holder in each bathroom has holes for 5 brushes &#8212; that&#8217;s 10 total in a two-bedroom apartment and our brushes don&#8217;t even fit!&#8221; While that particular complaint may not have been the driving force behind the decision to renovate, if there is one thing a New York apartment doesn&#8217;t need, it is room for 10 toothbrushes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We sent three contractors their way and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a> immediately clicked with the family, guiding them on first-time renovation questions and helping them sequence the work to take advantage of the space they had. Above all else, Ellen and Ben wanted to open up the space, make the room feel brighter, and incorporate features that would use water more conservatively. Out with the industrial-flush toilet, bland beige vanity, and tetris tile! In the master bath, the stand-up shower was unnecessarily tight and penned in by a dropped ceiling, but keeping the overall layout in place let Ellen focus on the fun of the hunt for just the right materials and fixtures and feel.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stand-in-shower-and-vanity-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47840 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-Before.jpg" alt="bathroom with single sink vanity and stand-in shower and white square tiles on half walls and toilet before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-Before-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ellen and Ben decided to stick with a simple black and white contrast in the master bath. Large-format matte black hex tiles found on Amazon are lined with a light gray grout and provide an anchor for the new wall tile. Ellen went with classic subway wall tile laid in a straight grid &#8211; the unstaggered approach is a more modern and linear take on a perennial design choice. Ellen&#8217;s pièce de résistance is the wooden vanity. We assumed that beauty was a custom piece &#8211; nope &#8211; Ellen took a <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a> side table and worked with their contractor to customize it for plumbing, adding a marble topper and <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Vox-Round-Vessels-above-counter-bathroom-sink/productDetail/Above-counter-Sinks/427975.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> vessel above-counter sink to shield the wood from water exposure. A wall-mounted faucet by California Faucets keeps the sink counter clear and adds simplicity with a single handle. Ellen should definitely get a cut of any future side-table-as-sink West Elm sales&#8230;!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-hexagon-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47841 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-1.jpg" alt="bathroom with black hexagon floor tiles and single sink vanity with legs and ceramic vessel round sink and mirrored medicine cabinets and walk-in shower after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ellen_Ben-Bathroom-After-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> medicine cabinets were installed side-by-side for tons of concealed storage and added under cabinet lighting that illuminates the black and white tiles and warm wood console. Despite lots of in-wall plumbing, the contractor was able to carve out three marble niches in the shower and lined the shower step with an extra slab of marble. The new shower is partially enclosed with a frameless glass door that visually doubles the size of the room, and stands opposite a new white entry door with a modern frosted-glass feature that lets light in from the adjacent room without compromising privacy. To reduce water usage and minimize cleaning and upkeep needs, Ellen chose a minimalist <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Dual-Flush-Toilets/article/CNT123600001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dual-flush Kohler toilet</a>, skirted to conceal piping, and finished the bathroom&#8217;s new &#8216;do with striking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brizo-T60280-BL-Siderna-Tempassure-Themostatic/dp/B00B0EVKGS/?pebp=1423009653024&amp;pebp=1423009653032&amp;ref=sr_1_17&amp;qid=1423009650&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=matte+black+shower+fixtures&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;peasin=B00B0EVKGS&amp;peasin=B00B0EVKGS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brizo</a> matte black fixtures for the shower.</p>
