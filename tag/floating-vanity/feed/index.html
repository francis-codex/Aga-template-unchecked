										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">These 7 modern bathroom designs by Sweeten homeowners show off a wide range of inspiration</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with white marble and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #76808f;">Modern bathroom designs can be sleek or warm. (<em>Above</em>) Sweeten homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;"><span class="s3">Lexi&#8217;s minimalist bathroom renovation</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3>A fresh version of modern</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you think of a modern classic bathroom, images of white tile accented with contemporary fixtures come to mind. This vision is true but the design palette can also stretch beyond that. Texture, tone, shape, and color all contribute to the look for an updated definition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern can fit in a variety of styles, including traditional, minimalist, or farmhouse. </span><span class="s1">Here, a look at seven different Sweeten renovations proving a modern classic bathroom is in the eye of the beholder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Sweeten</span><span class="s1"> matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—for free.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tactile finishes deliver a modern bathroom design</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46812 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Actress Jaime Ray Newman and partner Guy Nattiv worked with two designers and their Sweeten contractor to form a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-of-a-kind look for their remodel</a>. In their master bathroom, they chose multiple unique handmade tiles for the walls and floors. Also, a light wood vanity was a natural material that anchored the whole space. As a result, the couple’s choices proved that light-color tile with texture and shape could bring just the right amount of subtle drama to a modern bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Modern bathroom with mixed finishes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" title="black-and-white-bathroom-floor-tiles" class="alignnone wp-image-41691 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Designing <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their bathroom remodel</a> with floor-to-ceiling white subway tile gave Tina and Andrew a classic base to build on. What they added to it brought personality and dimension. A vintage-style exposed shower fixture shows what’s old is new again. The mixing of finishes—brass and chrome—is a popular trend. For extra storage, a double-wide medicine cabinet extends past the custom blue vanity for some asymmetry. Lastly, a shower curtain textile with a pattern and tassel trim is the final soft touch.</p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">A soft side to modern</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" title="subway-tiles-blue-paint-bathroom-walls" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg" alt="wood veneer custom cabinets with glass shower door and white vessel sink on floating cabinet after renovation " width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-33433 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-MelissaMideaker-KitchenBathCloset18-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1">Melissa’s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/this-couples-built-ins-just-keep-on-giving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500-square-foot apartment</a> went through clever design changes for her and her partner to live comfortably. Their bathroom, which barely had room to turn around in, borrowed square footage from the bedroom next door. The couple’s design plan demonstrates that a modern vibe can have a softer side. The cool stone-look tile pulls you in with help from natural light streaming in. Also, soft curves in the drop-in sink and fixtures add to the ambiance. Wood tones always bring in warmth when a space needs it. Here&#8217;s one more modern idea: a built-in cabinet inside the shower is tucked between a beam and shower wall for covered storage!</p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A clean<span>—</span>but not overly simple<span>—</span>aesthetic</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="A modern bathroom design of Moroccan tile floor and subway tile shower" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone wp-image-48734 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sisters <span class="s3">Nicole and Missy</span> turned to Sweeten to begin their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-sibling-duo-renovates-an-arlington-basement-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arlington bathroom renovation</a>. Nicole originally thought she wanted a simple and clean white bathroom. However, as the project unfolded, she realized she wanted more personality in the design thanks to her Sweeten contractor&#8217;s suggestions. The sliding barn shower door and white-washed oak vanity came in to complete this modern bathroom design. </span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Black matte finish on a clean canvas</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-47426 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg" alt="A modern loft bathroom with marble stone and black fixtures" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lexi-Bathroom-23-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This Manhattan couple went with a minimalist white color scheme for <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-loft-renovation-realizes-new-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Greenwich Village</a> modern <span class="s3">bathroom design.</span> Their Sweeten contractor installed a sleek vanity characterized by linear silhouettes and a geometric shower niche. A black matte faucet was installed on the wall, which boosts the contemporary factor. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Gray grout offsets modern gold touches</span></h3>

<div><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg" alt="A modern bathroom with white walls, gray tile and wooden vanity" width="666" height="1000" class="alignnone wp-image-49439 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg 666w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For <span class="s3">Amy and Kevin’s </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">LA bathroom renovation,</span></a> they, like many other renovators, chose classic subway tile. However, they tweaked the look by using gray grout. (Gray is a great choice as it is both classic and contemporary at the same time.) They also selected a large-format gray tile for the floor, which grounded the room. To pull in a traditional aesthetic, the couple put in a 30-inch vanity in a natural wood tone. </span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">A modern bathroom design mixes in classic fixtures</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46861 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg" alt="A modern Chicago bathroom with gray walls, stone tile and double vanity sink" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Brian-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><span class="s2">Leah and Brian</span><span class="s1"> worked with a Sweeten contractor to update their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago loft’s bathroom</a>. They went with antique brass for the finishes—as seen in the pendant light, shower head, and faucet—to give it a classic look. To add in a modern vibe, they chose porcelain tile in a gloss finish for the walls. Matte finish tiles laid in a herringbone pattern on the shower floor complete the look.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Chris and Lisa bought a two-bedroom apartment in Kew Gardens, Queens, because they needed more space for their family, including their daughter Mackenzie and their dog Porkchop. Even though the apartment already felt like home, they wanted to renovate to make it even more suitable to their needs and lifestyle, with more storage topping the priority list. Plus, from a design standpoint, “there was little to be excited about,” the couple shared.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with a Sweeten general contractor </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-becomes-a-workflow-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to renovate their kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the couple decided to tackle their bathroom about a year and a half later and </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their new project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matched with the same general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were completely happy with the renovation work that he had done for us and decided to work with him again for our bathroom,” they shared.</span></p>

We wanted clean lines and a more modern feel with just a pop of color, with sleeker finishes that were easy to keep clean especially with a child at home,” they shared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a full demolition of the old fixtures and materials, the couple started to reimagine the space. The footprint largely remained the same, but fresh tile, a new vanity, and a large, mirrored medicine cabinet had a big impact on the functionality and look. Fun fact: The medicine cabinet is equipped with an electric outlet, defogger, lights, and a digital clock!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They did take space from an unused closet in their bedroom adjacent to the bathroom, which they used to build shelving (made from custom cut butcher block) and created a permanent home for towels—a much more convenient option than going out of the bathroom into a linen closet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple opted for an environmentally-and-budget-friendly glass tile for the walls. They loved the wood-look floor tiles (with a non-slip texture) installed in the kitchen, so they used the same ones for the bathroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, Chris and Lisa had a great experience working with their Sweeten general contractor. “One of the best things about working with him is that we were able to just get the fixtures and not worry about anything. His team was professional and worked with what we gave them. For the shower, we bought the wrong diverter, and they just went out and found the correct one to fit in, no big deal. In fact, there wasn’t much worrying done on our part because we knew we were in good hands,” they shared.</span></p>

Lisa took their daughter and dog to her sister’s house upstate during the renovation, while Chris lived in the space during construction (the building has a basement bathroom he could access and friends offered their showers for him to use too).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their advice to future renovators? “Don’t be afraid to invest in items that will give you what you need in the long run. Even with all the price shopping we did, we went slightly over our budget going with fixtures that worked for our lifestyle, but we knew remodeling is also an investment into our comfort, so we’re okay with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A new pocket door is a major space-saver!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tackling a bigger bathroom renovation project—six ways to make the most of the space you have</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a too-small bathroom?  While some renovators choose to expand the space or reimagine the footprint, those types of changes can <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the budget</a>. So how can you make a bathroom appear larger with the space you already have? Read on to learn how Sweeten general contractors undertook bigger bathroom renovation projects. Here&#8217;s how they updated homeowners&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small bathrooms to feel bigger—without changing the overall square footage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>1.) Install a floating vanity<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25453 size-full" title="floating vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="floating vanity" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nancy_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>If having a closet in or next to your bathroom isn&#8217;t an option, consider a vanity with drawers or doors. Some vanities are freestanding, but floating vanities are attached to the wall and do not “sit” on the ground. That extra space means the flooring can extend to the wall, which actually makes the room look larger. Nancy&#8217;s bathroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/head-turner-bathroom-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectly demonstrates that idea</a>, showing off the ornate black and white tile. Since she couldn&#8217;t change the layout of the space due to code compliance, this offered a great alternative in the overall vision of opening up the bathroom.</p>
<h2><b>2.) Or if you have enough storage, try a pedestal sink</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38077 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="black-hexagon-bathroom-floor-tiles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg" alt="pedastal sink with black faucet and fixtures and wooden shelves above toilet and black hexagon floor tiles and medicine cabinet with mirror after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Saira-Zia-Bathrooms-02-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">If storage isn’t an issue, a classic space-saving option is a pedestal sink. In Saira and her husband’s East Village apartment, they had two small bathrooms they needed to update to accommodate their family of four. In the powder room, they opted for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/guest-full-bathroom-renovation-east-village/"><span class="s1">classic, white porcelain pedestal sink.</span></a> They used shelving above the toilet and a mirrored vanity for their storage needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp" alt="Black and white bathroom remodel" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-57267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-200x300.webp 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6292-Jeremy-KitchenBath-17-600x900.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy and Chris chose a</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pedestal sink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with console legs that show off the tiled walls and floors, and give this classic NYC bathroom a more spacious feel. &#8220;In such a small space, we took a cue from hotel bathrooms and put a pedestal sink atop console legs to keep the space open. An extra-tall recessed medicine cabinet provides both storage and electrical outlets,&#8221; Jeremy shared.</span></p>
<h2><b>3) Stick with neutrals or go tone-on-tone</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33805 size-full" title="glass-shower-door-vanity-mirror" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="white farmhouse sink near glass shower door to walk in shower and vanity mirror over marble countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Jessica-Kaplan-Bathroom-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Too much color can be hard to get right in a small space. A safe bet to opening up a small bathroom? Choose neutrals that don’t compete for attention. Jessica and Kevin swapped out pink marble for a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bathroom-goes-from-clunky-to-classy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white and gray color palette</a> that lent their space a more spa-like feel.</p>
<h2><b>4.) Opt for a larger mirror</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36996 size-full" title="small bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg" alt="small bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Christina-Kilijan-Apt-18-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina had wanted to renovate her 550-square-foot studio in Murray Hill since she moved in. She knew exactly what she wanted—including tons of bathroom storage space. To achieve this, she </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/alcove-studio-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installed a large, mirrored medicine cabinet.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The mirror takes up most of the wall, automatically giving the room the illusion of more space, without changing the layout at all.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5.) Take advantage of wall space</b><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22407 mt-24 mb-0 size-full" title="recessed storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="Scandinavian white bathroom with storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></h2>
<p class="p1">Even if your bathroom has a small footprint, you can always build onto the wall, or in Maria and Eric&#8217;s case <i>into</i> the walls. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/"><span class="s1">recessed shelving</span></a> unit tucks in just behind their bathroom door. This minimalist solution boasts more storage without adding bulk.</p>
<h2><b>6.) Ditch the tub &amp; shower curtain for a bigger bathroom</b></h2>

In one of Tara and Mike&#8217;s bathrooms, they did just that, while leaving the rest of the floorplan as-is.</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A glass bathroom door is even more effective when used in an </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open shower style</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like in Charon and Lex’s bathroom. Removing the tub altogether opened up the space, making it more comfortable for two people (especially since Lex is 6&#8217;2&#8243;)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another factor that worked in their favor: the use of one color (in different shades). </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14780#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rip-and-replace bathroom</a> in Yorkville, Manhattan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Deborah purchased this 1-bed, 1-bath co-op apartment and within a year, she could no longer live with the old, grimy tiles and outdated look, so she turned to Sweeten. Her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3531#references" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten design-build firm</a> went to work freshening up the space (she redid her kitchen as well; see results <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-pretty-entry-for-a-classic-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). The goal was to modernize the small space with new fixtures and finishes while retaining the original footprint. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t allowed to expand the existing footprint,&#8221; says Deborah, &#8220;because my co-op wouldn&#8217;t allow a &#8216;wet space-over-dry-space&#8217; rule.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they went to demo the bathroom, the contractor discovered that the waste lines were all sunk into the floor, rather than the walls, where they are usually found. They had to redo them all, which added an additional week to the project for inspections and approvals and an extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="off-white-bathroom-with-glass-door" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49097 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="Off white bathroom with glass door to tub and white vanity with oval sink after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deborah-BathKitchen-Before-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: A calm color palette provides a serene spot to get ready for the day. White subway tile and a subtle gray paint on the walls are paired with a modern white floating <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> with custom pull-out drawers, which provides more accessible and usable space than traditional doors. The vanity, with ample storage, was a suggestion by her contractor and &#8220;meant I didn&#8217;t need a bulky medicine cabinet,&#8221; said Deborah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A metal grille cover was created for the radiator. A combination of white-plank <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelving-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open shelving</a> and a glass shelf above the toilet provide plenty of display space for small toiletries. The Sweeten contractor also came up with the idea to add the paneling on the side of the bathtub for a classic look, as well as framing the window in white Thassos marble molding. Topped off with a frameless shower enclosure, the space is functional and beautiful, a major improvement from its predecessor. &#8220;My contractor was excellent with design,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am thrilled with my new bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Everyone loves a window in the bathroom, and the Sweeten contractor was sure to frame this one with a waterproof application that would keep the space watertight for years to come.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Modernize a bath in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Older apartments often come with quirks, especially with plumbing. In Lori’s 1930 co-op apartment in Brooklyn, one of those quirks materialized as a two-foot square platform that elevated the toilet by three inches. “It was protruding into the small room,” said Lori. To make the space more open, the platform needed to go. As did the dark blue faux marble tiles, which made the bathroom seem heavy. A vanity also needed to be retired. “It was an awful, dark, scratched up wood that we temporarily painted,” said Lori. Plus, it didn’t provide much storage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: She decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/18406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post her project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects renovators with vetted general contractors. Of course, solving an old plumbing issue is easier said than done. Lori’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> discovered the toilet’s waste pipe was crucial to the apartment floors above (her apartment is on the first floor). The toilet plumbing required additional room, hence the platform. However, her contractor figured out a workaround by cutting a stack of plywood into the shape of the new toilet base. He then stacked them under the new toilet, which was lower than the old one, to give the plumbing the additional space it needed. “The plywood was covered with a small mosaic tile that blends into the floor tile,” said Lori. “It’s barely noticeable now.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The newly renovated look leaned on bright whites with a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patterned floor tile</a> to add some excitement. The floating wooden <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> offers a warm pop of color as well as storage, but when Lori first saw it in the new space, it looked bigger than she had hoped. Her Sweeten contractor had another practical fix for that, moving it two inches lower down the wall. “That made it much less obtrusive and we were really happy with it after,” she said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Lori had not decided on a general contractor yet when she spoke with Miranda in client services at Sweeten about who would be a good match for her project. Miranda described the previous projects of the Sweeten contractor Lori ultimately picked. She also saw a Sweeten blog post on a previous project. “It was great to have someone to talk to behind an online service,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A Manhattan bath gets new fixtures and finishes nearly 15 years later than planned</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Nancy and Aram purchased their 1-bed, 2-bath, 1,500-square-foot loft apartment in 2000 and made updates throughout the space soon after moving in. A few years down the road, they realized the work in their Chelsea bathroom was not up to standard: the subfloor wasn’t stable and as a result, the penny tile kept popping up. The wall tiles fared only slightly better, and other finishes were showing their age. The pedestal sink proved to be inadequate for their needs, with no countertop space or storage beneath. A tub, original to the home purchase, was unnecessary since neither Nancy nor Aram enjoyed baths. But one of the original bathroom renovation ideas they kept was the cabinet that they had installed during the first remodel, with its custom cut-out for their cat, Floyd, to access his kitty litter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With grand visions of a wide, spacious shower and a reconfigured floor plan, Nancy and Aram <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a><span class="s1">, a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors </span>and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose this Sweeten contractor</a> to execute their plans. Unfortunately, they discovered early on through a walkthrough with an architect that the Sweeten contractor recommended that their dreams were not code-compliant. Specifically, their desired layout would not provide the required clearance in front of the toilet, as specified by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They regrouped and proceeded with the project, opting to keep the old footprint and changing out all the fixtures and finishes. Nancy had wanted a patterned terrazzo or cement tile for the new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and pored over dozens of virtual and physical samples. Ultimately, it was Aram who chose the new floor, spotting it just as they were heading out of the tile store: a black-and-white ceramic tile made to resemble the Moroccan-inspired cement options that Nancy had liked. (Fun tidbit: the couple hauled hundreds of pounds of tile in their car to NYC from the tile store in Hillsdale, NY, where they had previously renovated several baths in their second home. They were, shall we say, very committed to their upstate tile lady.) With the centerpiece flooring picked out, they chose a beveled white subway tile to complement it. A 1/3-offset installation gave the traditional tile a nice sense of flow. In place of the old tub, their contractor installed a shower with glass walls and a sliding glass door (a smaller version of what they had originally envisioned). For walls and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetry</a>, they chose <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/887/pink-cloud?color=887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this shade</a> of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/why-millennial-pink-refuses-to-go-away.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">millennial pink</a> while in a state of distress the day after the presidential election—but were surprised to discover that they still loved the color, even after the shock subsided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Nancy agonized over the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a>, given that space required unusual dimensions. A custom-ordered Duravit vanity with an integrated sink and countertop fit the bill, coordinating perfectly with their overall bathroom renovation ideas—it didn’t block Floyd’s kitty litter access and was shallow enough while providing <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> for small items that Nancy wanted within easy reach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Black-and-white ceramic floor tile, white beveled subway wall tile, penny shower tile: Country Town Marble &amp; Tile (Hillsdale, NY).

<p>Since it&#8217;s practically invisible, a glass shower enclosure is a one of our favorite bathroom renovation ideas for a smaller bathroom. In Mary Ann&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/88-year-old-master-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master bath</a>, the glass shower makes the space to feel open and bright.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renovate an outdated</a> brown and beige bathroom</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Meredith and Jason knew when they bought their Chelsea home in 2015 that a bathroom renovation was in order. “Everything about it was old and ugly,” Meredith said. The plumbing was malfunctioning, the tub was worn, and the original designer hadn’t configured the layout to maximize the room. A bulky medicine cabinet and vanity gobbled up space. “The drawers would hit the radiator when you pulled them out,” Meredith remembers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: They turned to <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to implement a </span>few key elements in the design that really helped make a small space behave like a big one. The couple’s <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> made a custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medicine cabinet</a> that wrapped around some problem pipes behind the wall, enabling it to be recessed. A smaller <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/12-bathroom-sink-vanity-ideas-from-nyc-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> allowed the doors to open all the way, providing more functional storage space, while a new wall-hung <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> worked wonders: “You basically gained six to seven inches more by putting the tank into the wall,” Meredith said. The aesthetic needed to match the rest of the apartment, which was clean and current without being too modern. Against a bright background, the faucets and shower fixtures really popped with a black matte finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The Sweeten contractor suggested some floor tiles that the couple say they would never have considered on their own. The result tied together the black matte of the fixtures and the rest of the bathroom’s design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Floor and wall tiles: <a href="https://www.artistictile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artistic Tile</a>.

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Carroll Gardens homeowner Kim Solop </span></i></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After ten years of living in our Carroll Gardens condo, we really needed a change. We contemplated a move to the suburbs or upgrading to a bigger place in a less popular Brooklyn neighborhood. After almost a year of looking and being priced out in our current neighborhood, we decided to renovate our current place, a two-bed, two-bath, 1,200 square-foot condo that we bought in 2006. We loved our current neighborhood with its proximity to our workplaces, lots of cute restaurants, shops, and our two sons’ schools. The problems were in the apartment itself: I was unhappy with the dark kitchen—I always had been. I love taking baths but hated the jet tub that was installed over a decade ago. Lastly, our laundry closet had a lot of wasted space and I wanted to add a walk-in pantry!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a big fan of home decor blogs, I had been stalking the Sweeten site for a while, and really loved seeing the transformations that the contractors could do with space. I was excited for the chance to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our renovation</a>. I met with a couple of them, and decided on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten contractor</a>. I really clicked with the project managers and could see that we would have a good partnership.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main objective for the kitchen was to brighten it up and eliminate the space between the cabinets and the ceiling. I hated how this wasted space looked and the amount of dust it collected. After a few weeks of sourcing materials, we were ready to go! I knew from the get-go that I wanted a white kitchen, as well as shaker-style cabinets with quartz countertops that were marble look-alikes. Other than that, I was pretty open to ideas. Our contractor came over with a wealth of ideas for how we could open the kitchen up to maximize light. (Unfortunately, there are no windows in the kitchen, so there was only so much we could do.) I debated another set of cabinets on top of the current ones, but eventually decided against it. I switched gears a bit on the white color palette, choosing instead a dual-tone kitchen with white uppers and gray lower cabinets. After living with long pulls, I decided to go with smaller handles on all the cabinetry. Quartz countertops were also a must, for the durability factor! With two kids and a husband who are not always the neatest, I knew that we needed a tough work surface. I was adamant about getting a wine fridge. As members of a few wine clubs, we struggled to find space to keep our wine at the right temperatures.</p>

<p>Our microwave above the range was replaced with a microwave drawer, and a hood was installed above the stovetop instead. With the new wine fridge taking up precious cabinet space, I did lose a place for pots and pans. Our contractor was able to give me deep drawers in the pantry to make up for this lost storage. My other kitchen must-haves were a deep, white porcelain sink, and an under-counter pull-out garbage can.</p>

<p>Across the kitchen was a room that held just the washer and dryer with inaccessible space that was wasted. When we extended the wall, there was room for a customized pantry with countertops, shelving, and cabinetry that matched the kitchen. After not having a pantry for so long, it’s amazing to have one, and the additional space has really been a lifesaver. I had envisioned barn doors, but there was not enough wall space for it. The double doors we ended up hanging looked so plain and boring. I had some wallpaper left over from the hallway&#8211;so I went for it and covered the doors too. I think it turned out nicely.</p>

<p>For the bathroom, I wanted a totally new look that was modern and clean. We went with dark floors, a deep soaking tub, and a floating vanity. Our contractor showed me a picture of another bathroom he did, and I loved it so much, we copied it almost exactly. It came out perfectly and I am fighting my older son almost daily for baths! The tub is divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We actually lived in the space during the whole renovation, which lasted about seven weeks. It was definitely challenging and required a lot of patience. The contractor and his crew were great about cleaning up, however, and we made the best of it with lots of takeout dinners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading the Sweeten blog for so many years, it was exciting to embark on my own renovation. I realized that renovating is messy and dirty, and almost always takes longer than you had originally anticipated. You learn to roll with the punches, and realize that things happen. We had a few hiccups along the way, such as wanting the barn door on the pantry that wasn’t going to work, so I learned to compromise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoyed working with our Sweeten contractor,  who made himself available at all hours. He was in constant communication and has remained a friend to this day. We love our new kitchen and other improvements, and are planning on staying to enjoy them for many years to come!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a Manhattan couple purchased a Classic Six in a pre-war co-op on the Upper West Side, they envisioned turning the extra powder room into a full bath. They would need to move both the toilet and the vanity to make it work, but with a few streamlined fixtures, it looked like there might be just enough room to get a full shower in there. The couple </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their bathroom renovation project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and were matched with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Aleks</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who helped them navigate through the City’s plumbing regulations and the building board requirements &#8211; no small feat! Here’s how it all came together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/new-life-half-bath-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16848 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/marjorie-bathroom.jpg" alt="half bath converted to full bath renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/marjorie-bathroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/marjorie-bathroom-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><span id="more-16844"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on systems hidden behind the walls (plumbing lines, gas lines, electrical wiring, vertical piping, or ventilation ducts) is inherently more extensive (and expensive) than a typical home renovation. In order to turn this half bath into a full bath, this project required re-designing the room’s footprint entirely: moving the toilet placement to the adjacent corner under the window, rotating the sink’s location, and sliding it over to make room for a spa shower. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">City regulations are very cautious about plumbing alterations, and co-op and condo boards want to minimize situations where residents might be exposed to damage from renovations in adjacent units. This often means that building boards do not permit residents to move “wet” spaces (like kitchens and baths) over “dry” spaces (like a downstairs neighbor’s living room or bedroom). A building’s pipe stacks run vertically up and down the height of the structure, so moving plumbing lines is generally not an option for urban residents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the water lines in this building already supported the half bath, stepping up to a full bath was possible here, though it did involve plumbing permits and work by a licensed master plumber &#8212; both expenses that might not be required in a more conventional bathroom renovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16853" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-11-12.gif" alt="sliding pocket glass door" width="600" height="899" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16849" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation uws" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16850" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="sleek bathroom renovation with walk-in shower" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the layout changes planned, Aleks and team replaced all of the finishes from the ground up, bringing in a serene white and soft gray marble stone tile, installed from floor to ceiling in and around all wet areas. The new shower is encased in glass and three (!) shower heads&#8211;large rain, hand-held, and steam&#8211;pack a serious punch in the slim, walk-in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old sink was moved and replaced with a minimal-footprint floating vanity in a dark wood finish with two drawers for storage, supporting a white porcelain basin, adding a touch of drama to the neutral decor. The toilet was also replaced with a narrow, tank-less version with a traditional lever. All hardware throughout was finished in shiny chrome metal, complimenting the clean, polished aesthetic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the small space clear, the team built a sliding pocket entry door with frosted glass and silver framing for privacy and modern appeal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The documentation and services needed for this kind of project are important to understand. Major renovations involving layout changes typically start in the range of $150 – $250 per square foot, and include an additional ~20-35% for design fees and permit / inspection fees that an architect, engineer, or expediter will charge, on top of your budget for materials and labor. And any plumbing work beyond the direct replacement of a fixture or a simple repair requires a licensed plumber, resulting in higher hourly labor costs and fees where layout changes are occurring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16851" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg" alt="enclosed walk-in glass shower" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-09-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16852" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="sleek showerheads and marble tiles" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SWEETEN_Marjorie_Bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The added cost can have a serious pay-off: an extra full bathroom in a city apartment is a huge upgrade for the current residents, and re-sale value between a half bath and a full-bath can approach or exceed the original investment.
