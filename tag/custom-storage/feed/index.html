<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Freshen up a worn-out bathroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After renting an alcove studio in Park Slope for about two years, Matt, a software engineer, purchased his first home in July 2013. The 360-square-foot apartment in a neighboring co-op, built in 1950, would also become the future home of a cat named Josie, adopted in the months following the renovation. Four years passed while Matt lived in the space and saved up some money to update the outdated and decrepit bathroom. “Random pieces of tile were missing, my old sink was missing one of its support legs, and parts of the ceiling showed weakening,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I wanted a complete renovation not only to feel better about the space, but also as an investment.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.</p></blockquote>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Not knowing where to begin the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>, Matt found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with his contractor</a>. He imagined a clean and refreshing space, one with an inoffensive style that wouldn’t deter a future buyer or sublet tenant. “I love subway tile, so selecting that for the walls was an easy decision,” said Matt. Large-format charcoal gray square floor tile completes the simple backdrop for the space. A floating wood vanity injects a modern sensibility. For additional storage, a matching <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wooden cabinet</a> sits in a recessed spot on the wall opposite the vanity. And to make sure the cabinet didn’t protrude too far out, its depth was halved.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="floating-wood-vanity-under-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49151 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Floating wood vanity under a white sink in a white bathroom with walk in shower and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-sink-brown-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49153 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White sink with brushed nickel bathroom fixtures and a dark brown vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Matt intended to install a new bathtub, a tricky plumbing situation would have affected nearby apartments, so the installation was a no-go. Instead, the existing tub was transformed into a spacious walk-in shower, complete with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner shelves</a>, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a>, and subtly patterned floor tile. “Despite the scope change, I couldn’t be happier with the result,&#8221; he reports. &#8220;The shower is huge!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge? Living through the renovation. “For about seven weeks, my bed became my apartment. It’s where I slept, ate, read, and watched Netflix.” And while his bathroom was out of commission, Matt took advantage of the full bathroom in the building’s basement, which was newly renovated. “Each day I waddled down there with flip-flops and a shower caddy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt like I was back in college using the dorm’s community bathrooms.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-walk-in-shower-area" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49154 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="White walk in shower area with large nickel shower head and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><img decoding="async" title="large-nickel-showerhead-in-walk-in-shower" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49155 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Large nickel showerhead and open shelves in a white walk in shower area with subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges aside, Matt worked with Sweeten every step of the way, from project posting to completion. “Sweeten’s client services team was engaged throughout the project and made sure I had everything I needed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They were really specific in their communication; during the bidding process I was asked how one contractor compared to another, and other questions that helped guide my decision-making.” Heading into the project, he states, &#8220;Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matt’s advice for future first-time renovators: “Do your best to limit options for each decision, using your theme as guidance. It’s far easier to select the color of stone shower shelves from three colors instead of 10.” He also found his contractor’s input incredibly valuable, “My contractor’s best contribution was providing thoughtful, targeted material and fixture options,” which he said saved him from decision fatigue.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Match an entire apartment to a previous renovation and build dream shoe storage in Hell’s Kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Matthew, the managing director of a fashion advertising agency, bought his apartment in 2012, only half of it had gone through a renovation. A few elements, such as the kitchen, bathroom, and floors, were in the present. Everything else stood sadly in the past. The old radiators stuck out like sore thumbs. So did the sliding doors of the storage closets. Then Matthew had the sartorial problem of 87 pairs of shoes stacked up against a wall in the one-bedroom co-op.  “I really wanted to bring the entire apartment up to a modern, minimalist, clutter-free design,” said Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Much of the design was done from scratch, so Matthew <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4676#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> on Sweeten and worked with his design/build <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. “We literally went through twenty design options for the shoe closet alone,” Matthew said. But the outcome was worth it. The shoe storage is designed to Matthew’s shoe size, which is a nine. There is room for 90 pairs, including his favorites, Common Projects Blush sneakers and black Gucci loafers. The radiator in the living space is hidden under a desk where Matthew can sit for breakfast by the window. In the bedroom, a dressing bench, flanked by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom storage</a>, covers up the other radiator. The remaining closet doors were replaced to match the wood veneer of the shoe storage. Each door has hidden hardware and pops open when it is pushed, eliminating the need for handles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the renovation evolved, the Sweeten contractor also installed a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden storage unit</a> next to the laundry to utilize every inch of space in the 790-square-foot apartment. They also encouraged Matthew to replace the window trimmings to match the custom carpentry. “We did one window first and I loved it, so we just did every window,” Matthew said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matthew has a strong affection for the color orange. Its presence in his renovation was a must. “I wanted it in there but didn’t want it to be obnoxious,” he said. After bouncing around various options of visibility, Matthew settled on adding it to the inside of his shoe closet. “You have to open the closet and pull out a drawer, but I see it every day,” he said.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Custom desk (in mirror reflection): <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/catalog/office/desks/parsons-desks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a>.

			<h2>Want to cut down on prep steps? Need more space for guests? These Thanksgiving-ready kitchens by Sweeten do it all.</h2>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49065 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-20-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Thanksgiving is a time people look forward to seeing friends and family and being thankful. But those things aside, big gatherings can be stressful on homeowners. The biggest challenge is kitchen organization; cooking and prepping food, along with needing space to serve. The right kitchen features can help ease the frustrations caused by clutter. Sweeten has helped homeowners design Thanksgiving-ready kitchens to ease the holiday strain. We selected these specific kitchens for their unique characteristics that will make any get-together easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sweeten</span></a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Roomy kitchen countertops produce Thanksgiving meals with ease</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg" alt="chef in his kitchen" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone wp-image-42806 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Arnish-kitchen-Arnish-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">With friends and family gathering, Thanksgiving calls for generous kitchen counters. Yet, many kitchens lack the counter space it takes to host. Adding more work surface area creates more room and less clutter. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">As a chef, </a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/chef-remodels-belltell-loft-kitchen-brooklyn/">Arnish</a> </span>decided that a huge kitchen peninsula would solve many of his troubles. “Sometimes we have up to 80 people in the space.” Their renovation also included a wine fridge, which makes for less traffic in the kitchen when cooking and preparing.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>With large food prep, cooking, or spreading out platters, a considerable surface space is a must.</p>
<h3><strong>A small kitchen island comes with big advantages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ursula_Kitchen-08-09.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" class="alignnone wp-image-24678 size-full" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Small spaces can hold untapped potential. When <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/teacher-writes-lesson-kitchen-island/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ursula remodeled her kitchen with Sweeten</a>, she added a small kitchen island. The &#8220;dresser-style&#8221; island is a storage workhorse, providing three drawers for silverware, cutlery, dishes, and pots and pans. It&#8217;s ideal for food-forward holidays and dinner parties since it doubles as a serving station.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;"><strong>A deep and wide sink helps with dreaded dinner cleanup</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" title="white-countertop-with-farmhouse-sink"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg" alt="kitchen with white overhead cabinets and white countertop with farmhouse sink and backsplash with white subway tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-39860 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Aaron-Cummings-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">For dishes that can’t fit in the dishwasher and squeeze into a regular basin, deep and wide sinks don’t disappoint. Brooklyn brownstone owners <span>Christina and </span>Aaron, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/brownstone-kitchen-renovation-prospect-lefferts-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who renovated their kitchen with Sweeten</a>, chose a large volume farmhouse sink. The uniquely deep design is great for soaking extra-sticky dishes and accommodating baking trays or sauté pans.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Pass-throughs become conversation stations</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="all-white-kitchen-pass-through-window"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with stainless steel appliances and flush mounted ceiling light and pass through window bar with white countertop and white walls after renovation" width="2560" height="1707" class="alignnone wp-image-50990 size-full" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/White-Kitchen-Pass-Through-Bar-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Adding barstools to the kitchen island makes conversation during Thanksgiving more enjoyable. Guests eager to lend a helping hand can prepare food and chat with the host without being in the way. In this Sweeten kitchen renovation, homeowner <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-living-room-renovation-puts-a-pool-table-in-the-spotlight/">Dan found having barstools</a> at the pass-through offered seating and a more open feel to the space.</p>
<h3><strong>Built-in pot fillers let you work smarter, not harder during Thanksgiving</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Romuald_Kitchen-13-14.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-23867 size-full" style="color: #333333;" /></span></a>Installing a pot-filler above the stove eliminates a step from cooking. Romauld, an avid cook, included one in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/loft-apartment-inside-house/">his Elmhurst, Queens kitchen renovation.</a> No longer carrying a heavy pot from the sink to the stove allows him to save time and steps. This handy feature will make mashed potato duty at Thanksgiving (or corn on the cob, or pasta-making) much simpler.</p>
<h3><strong>The right kitchen appliances are a must for any Thanksgiving feast</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone wp-image-49067 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Kitchen-22-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /> </span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">When planning a kitchen remodel, updating old appliances bring energy efficiency, increase functionalities, and a modern clean look. Homeowner Katy, who renovated her Hamptons kitchen with Sweeten, called in help to pick new appliances. &#8220;<span>I let my mother-in-law—a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/">holiday-entertaining superwoman choose</a>.&#8221; Among her selections was a single oven &#8220;with the largest cubic heating space she could find.&#8221; </span></p>
<h3><strong>A walk-in pantry makes storage more accessible</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-25562 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Walk-in pantries keep the main kitchen area uncluttered (a difficult task during the holidays!) The extra storage allows food staples, beverages, and canned goods to stay organized. Whether the pantry has a door or an open entry, it adds to the character of the kitchen. <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/">Nazli painted her new kitchen pantry</a> a darker shade than the kitchen so the contents blended into the surrounding, seeming to disappear. If you&#8217;re an amateur home chef, consider adding a walk-in pantry for your larger kitchen appliances, pans, and bulk ingredients or spices.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="1 1 &#091;&#093;">Multifaceted kitchen island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="yellow kitchen tile" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-33846 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Dawn-Kikel-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span>Sweeten homeowners Dawn and David added a huge island kitchen in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/moroccan-tile-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Park Slope kitchen renovation with Sweeten</a>. “People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner.”</span><span>  There is room to prepare food <em>and</em> lay it out beautifully at the same time. (We&#8217;re also huge fans of the yellow Moroccan tile, sure to be a conversation piece with dinner guests!)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While a basic internet search brings up a lot of information on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen remodeling costs</a> or <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom renovation costs</a>, rates for built-in cabinets are harder to find. </span><span class="s1">This is due in part to the uniqueness of these projects—no two are the same! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That said, many millworkers rely on a linear footage model as a basis for calculating pricing, with various factors affecting overall cost. In urban areas like New York City, the range starts between $800 to $1,000 per linear foot for basic open shelving.</span></p>
<h4>Why are custom bookshelves so expensive?</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The number one misconception is the expected cost. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experienced GCs will guide you</a> on the several important factors that will attribute to creating your custom built-in bookshelves, according to NYC-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractors Nina and Ilya</a>.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Materials – “Lumber is expensive,” said Nina. “It may not look like it but there’s a lot of wood involved in turning the raw material into the finished product.” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Labor – This cost includes “preplanning, labor, studio, and shop work to prefabricate the product,” they said. “It then gets delivered to the site for installation.”</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Site condition – The existing condition of the space will determine if additional time and attention is required in designing or installing the project. Are the walls bowed or the floors uneven? Are there finishes that need to be matched to existing furniture or flooring? Other site variations can affect the price. Read more about site conditions below.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Custom built-ins result in a one-of-a-kind piece made to your exact specifications that fit precisely into your space. The work that goes into a custom built-in piece often extends beyond what homeowners can imagine: Skilled experts source the materials, design, build, and perfect the unit before transporting it from the workshop to your home.</p>
<p>In the end, you are paying for both service and craftsmanship, elements that are usually missing from an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; experience.</p>

<p>(<em>Above</em>) Deeksha and Joe wanted an old-style <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-interior-wall-of-windows-brings-light-to-this-guest-alcove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NYC built-in bookcase</a></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A note on material delays</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The contractors note that markets have been experiencing a </span><span class="s2">backlog in the supply of materials in many sectors. </span><span class="s1">“We’ve been experiencing some shortages in wood, lacquer, and paint,” said Ilya.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For NYC homeowners interested in renovating, consider <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/new-york-city-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s3">finding a licensed general contractor</span></a>, scheduling, and signing them to lock in material prices. Your contractor will be able to get your material orders in the queue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">They suggest building the delays into your timeline. “It’s taking 12–16 weeks for cabinets and built-ins from start to install,” said Ilya. “Stock cabinets deliver the fastest,” he said. “The more customized the design, the more it will add to the delivery time.”</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Custom bookshelves: Materials, installation, other features</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get an accurate estimate, you’ll need to take a few other variables into account. For example, the average range of</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">$800 to $1,000 per linear foot usually assumes that the unit will be no taller than eight feet.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">Excess height will translate into higher costs. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are other factors that can impact the budget of built-ins:</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s3">Materials for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multitude of options includes solid woods, plywood, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), veneers, high-pressure laminate, and melamine. The good news is you’ll definitely find a style to suit your style and needs. Some points to think about:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid wood</b> is the gold standard because it is both classic and timeless. While solid wood is usually strong and sturdy, some types may crack, buckle, or shrink when subject to heat and humidity.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>MDF</b> is a good option when you’re on a budget or if you plan on painting the shelves. It is composed of dried, pressed recycled wood fibers and resin. It withstands temperature changes better than many kinds of wood. It also acts as an excellent substrate for veneers.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Plywood</b> is an engineered wood like MDF but essentially made of pressed sheets of wood veneer, which is why layers are visible along the edges. Higher grades of plywood are used for cabinets and shelving, while lower grades are what you might see in housing construction and subfloors. As with solid woods, you can choose different types of plywood such as maple, pine, or birch.</span></li>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Finishes for custom bookshelves</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">After choosing the materials, decide how you’d like your shelves finished. Options to consider:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Paint</b> is the go-to option. With this route, there may be a price difference based on the method of application (brush, roller, or spray), and the quality and brand of the paint you choose.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Solid</b> <b>lacquer </b>is a popular choice, which provides hard, glossy finishes that range in the level of sheen from clear to colored. Lacquer produces an extremely damage-resistant finish. It’s ideal for projects that see a lot of traffic, such as low shelving in a child’s room.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Varnish</b> is usually transparent but also comes in a range of glossy to satin finishes. Like lacquer, it produces a durable finish.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s2"><b><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Unfinished</b> shelving creates a more industrial contemporary look.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">A lot of labor goes into producing a high-quality painted finish. (For a case study, read about the time and labor spent on <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-architect-couple-turn-a-small-fixer-upper-into-a-gem/"><span class="s3">Kate and Arthur’s DIY cabinets</span></a>.) The entire process can take up to five days and include up to four coats of primer and finish. Compared to two to three coats of a high-quality clear lacquer that can be applied in as little as one day. The additional labor costs easily offset the savings of less expensive, “paint-grade” materials.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Site conditions</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The type of building structure you live in—house, apartment, walk-up, or elevator—contributes to pricing differentials when it comes to built-ins. Projects in apartments often take longer to deliver and install than those in houses. “Labor costs increase when materials need to be maneuvered in a walk-up building,” Ilya said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In addition to the logistics of parking and unloading on a busy city street, some apartment buildings have strict work hours for contractors. This can limit the amount of work that they can finish in one day, stretching a one-day installation into two.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Features and components of custom bookshelves</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Simple open shelving is the least expensive built-in option. Most experts don’t calculate costs per additional drawer or door. However, the more features you include, the higher the overall cost. Glass doors or shelves, a floating desk, and lighting all add cost in time and materials.</span></p>
<p>Custom built-ins may conjure up visions of grand homes but, in fact, are great space-savers in smaller homes. These cabinets are the touch of millwork to up your storage game in any room. <span class="s4">When you’re ready to get started on your home remodel, work with us to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/"><span class="s5">renovate with the best contractors in NYC</span></a>.</span></p>
