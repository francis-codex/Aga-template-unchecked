<h3>Wrestling with the idea of renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We moved to Clinton Hill over a decade ago, and always loved the neighborhood with its history of housing for returning servicemen who worked in the Navy Yard. On a total whim, we went to an open house in the Clinton Hill Co-ops and made an offer on the first apartment we saw: an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom that had been converted into a junior two-bedroom.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was frighteningly familiar with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span class="s2">Clinton Hill Co-op section</span></a> of the Sweeten website. Our neighbor also used <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to renovate her kitchen, and it looked fantastic. It seemed like a simple concept, but Jim and I were just completely overwhelmed with the idea of a renovation. Because our <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apartment</a> really felt like it was falling down around us, we knew that we would need to change almost everything.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to look for a place upstate, hoping that more room and a home for weekend getaways would help alleviate the stress of our overcrowded and dark apartment. We made an offer on a house, had it approved, started to negotiate, and realized we needed to feel good in our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary residence</a> before we took on a second space.</p>

<h3>Finding our general contractor</h3>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We headed straight to </span>Sweeten<span style="text-align: justify;">, were <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with threeÂ general contractors</a> right away, and within a week </span>picked our contractor<span style="text-align: justify;">. He was incredibly responsive and patient with us as we walked through our apartment over and over again, thinking about the best way to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open our kitchen</a>, update the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>, reconfigure our bedroom, shore up our pockmarked walls and ceiling, refinish our floors, and add storage everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">We were absolutely giddy with the concept of overhead lighting! We were wired for several fixtures in the living room and kitchen, as well as recessed lights in the hallways and <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a>. Because our apartment had been dark and crowded for so long, we gravitated toward a simple, minimalist design with white and gray paint to brighten the space and give it a clean look.</span></p>
<h3>Personalizing the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jim grew up with visions of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island where everyone could gather</a> to eat and socializeâthat became our only non-negotiable. It helped us focus our <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning on the kitchen first</a>. We knew we wanted custom cabinets, so our contractor brought in his cabinet maker to meet with us and walk through the layout.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a week, they had sent us a 3D rendering of our new kitchen, with Jimâs dream island, plus an extended butcher block counter ideal for our boys to sit and finish homework while we cook. Our contractor suggested the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/sophisticated-chalkboard-paint-ideas-4582330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chalkboard paintânow a huge hit with the kids</a>. He created a lot of extra storage under the island, including drawers for our pots and pans, plus a pantry along the extended counter. We have a dishwasher for the first time ever and love the kitchen tile.</p>

<h3>Storage reimagined</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor had the genius idea to extend our bedroom two feet into the living room, which allowed him to build a closet (we used to store our clothes in the boysâ room). It was worth the minimal loss of space to gain more storage. We also hired a closet company to build a shoe closet for us. Since our room has two windows, we decided on an <span>opaque</span> glass door to maintain some privacy, but also take advantage of the natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36112 " srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-07-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor came through on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the boys&#8217;<span style="color: #333333;"> bedroom</span>, our only <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-renovation-kensington-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directive was storage</a>, storage, storage. We wanted to find a way to keep all of their things in the bedroom, instead of spilling out into our common living areas. Once again, <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our contractor came through</a> on the extra storage front and found a way to build a second closet in their room, ensuring we lost very little floor space. Weâre not falling all over stuff anymore!</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36200 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-13-1.gif" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, custom closets, kids' bedroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></h3>
<p>In the <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span>, we needed to keep a bathtub because we have young boys, and I insisted on a large piece of custom glass as our partial shower door. He warned me it might be difficult to reach around for the water control, but I insisted. It looks lovely, but he was rightâitâs a bit of a struggle to help with bathtime.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, bathroom, shower, toilet, home, design" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-36116 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Moving out during the renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biggest challenge was realizing that, because we were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovating the entire space</a>, we would have to move out for an extended period of time. We didnât initially budget to live somewhere else, so the added cost was a bit of a shock. After three months, we were scheduled to move back in and had left the rental, when our contractor told us he was about a week behind. Much of this delay was due to some delayed deliveries of things I had ordered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We had no place to go and had to live in the apartment while there were still tools and supplies everywhere, with no appliances or kitchen counters. It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Sweeten made us wonder what we had waited for. We were matched so quickly with a contractor, we were able to use the website to see examples of his work, we could reach out with questions and concerns. Another upside was the Sweeten blog, a huge source of inspiration! Our new apartment is <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what we had hoped for</a>: simple, comfortable, bright, and uncluttered. It feels like home.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter,Â </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartmentâs finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. Iâve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry rÃ©sumÃ©); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tightâwe were looking to renovate during our kidsâ summer break and move back in before school resumedâand when we werenât excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some whoâd worked in our co-ops. That sold us.Â </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Iâm a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while Iâm in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day.Â </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories Iâd collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents.Â </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldnât be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughtersâ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they werenât soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girlsâ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying weâll wake them.Â </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. Iâve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldnât <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other roomsâwe updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art weâve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love.Â </span></p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Dara</em></p>
<h3>Figuring out the best layout for the apartment</h3>
<p>Our building was originally constructed in 1930, possibly for officers of the Navy Yard located several blocks north. Like many buildings in NYC, it turned into a co-op in the &#8217;80s. The overall layout of the apartment was great, with a lot of natural light, but the configuration of the space in both bathrooms, as well as the kitchen, was awkward.</p>
<p>Mauricio, an architect, and I wanted to open up the kitchen so that all four of us, including our 5-year-old twins, could move around it comfortably while adding counter space and enlarging the existing island. But solving that problem was really challenging. We must have gone through at least ten different layouts.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We discussed everything from a standard galley kitchen layout, to relocating the gas line and stove,</span><span class="s2"> but nothing felt quite right. Then we said, &#8220;W</span><span class="s1">hat if we extend the kitchen by taking a bit of space away from the adjacent</span><span class="s2"> dining room?&#8221; Ultimately, we realized that by </span><span class="s1">moving the fridge and aligning it with an enlarged island,</span><span class="s2"> we could seamlessly expand the kitchen </span><span class="s1">without sacrificing room for our dining table</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p>The kitchen remodel worked, and now we have a much bigger kitchen with a lot more storage and prep space. We even have huge cabinets underneath our island. Most importantly, our dining room is still perfectly roomy.</p>

<h3>Renovation tip to help save time</h3>
<p>We planned for minimal construction and maximum impact.Â  The access point <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to the washer and dryer</a> was moved from the master bedroom to the third bedroom by easily rotating it in its existing space, rather than relocating it.Â That way, you donât need to walk through the master to do a load of laundry. It also allowed us a larger shower.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We opened up the âdenâ off the living room</span><span class="s2"> by removing built-ins along three walls </span><span class="s1">to create a more flexible space as a TV room and an office</span><span class="s2">. We saved money and time tailoring modular closets to our needs rather than building out new closets. </span>Non-layout items we needed to address included fixing the electric panel and installing new hardwood floors since the original wood was as thin as the veneer.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, we kept in mind our 3 R&#8217;s mantra: Things needed to be easily <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repairable, replaceable, or recyclable</a>. Most of our purchases were made from local stores that had minimum to no lead time. We chose not to do anything custom until our kids stopped sharing a bedroom when they get older; we might need to rethink some of the spaces.</p>

<h3>Compromising on style</h3>
<p>In terms of style, we tried to reach a middle ground between our preferences. I chose a more eclectic style in the second bathroom: gray-and-blue patterned tiles on the floor and shower wall mixed with large white subway tiles. In the master bathroom, Mauricio preferred a more streamlined and minimalist look with grays and whites with a floating white glossy vanity.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the kitchen cabinets, we went with Ikea, that we could upgrade to semi-custom later on. We wanted solid hardwood that was reminiscent in the color of the original floor, but more modern looking. We chose a white oak in wide planks.</p>
<h3>A good-working Sweeten reno team</h3>
<p>Our Sweeten contractor and his dad made a great team. He was very easy to talk to, and his dad was quite resourceful, with many solutions for various problems we encountered along the way. We had a lot of opinions and ideas, and we were thankful that our contractor took the time to talk things through. We could debate different ideas with him, but he was never pushy or non-communicative.</p>
<h3>Avoiding subcontractor issues</h3>
<p>One thing we would do differently is to put all of the renovation items (except finishes) under the contractor umbrella. We bought our countertop slabs from a local store, which encouraged us to use their fabricator rather than using our contractor to oversee the subcontractors. At installation, there were problems with sizing and fit. The fabricator blamed the contractor for moving the kitchen cabinets. Meanwhile, the contractor blamed the fabricator for cutting a countertop that didnât fit. If the fabricator had been a subcontractor of our contractor, and under his supervision, that would have all been avoided.</p>

<p>Finally, weâre extremely happy with our home. After the full renovation of our apartment, all four of us can have breakfast at the kitchen island with room to spare. Plus, with all of the closets plus the kitchen storage, we finally have enough space to store everything. It all makes us happy on a daily basis. <span class="s1">Now we are gearing up for renovating our rooftop, to create an outdoor space for our family that rivals the interior.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Erica</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâs hard to believe a wall can have such a profound impact on how two people share space. Our kitchen, once barely big enough for one person, was transformed into what kitchens are meant to be: the heart of the home. Our 800-square-foot Clinton Hill apartment was a loved space, in every sense of the word. My then-fiancÃ©, Joshua, moved in and we decided to renovate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before Joshua joined me, I imagined what would happen if the wall between the living room and kitchen came down. Now that it was two of us, changes seemed necessary. Along with the wall, Joshua also dreamed of replacing the parquet floors with hardwood. (I much preferred parquet so those conversations often ended in agreeing to disagree.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apartment and all its quirks and beauties were familiar. We knew how we used the space, and which areas needed to become a better fit. We had a<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> budget for the kitchen</a>Â and vision. But who could we trust to help us move forward with our ideas? Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.Â </span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just choosing the right paint color felt overwhelming, so finding the right designer was a challenge.</span></i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten.com, and selected a firm with design/build services. The general contractor was familiar with the</span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clinton Hill Co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the complexities that exist in these apartments, which were originally constructed in the early 1940s. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44832 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Kitchen-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that first warm fall evening, she sat in our living room and listened carefully as we described what we hoped our home would be. We knew we wanted to remove a wall, upgrade the contractor-grade cabinetry, replace the appliances, and install under-cabinet lighting. But we were unsure of the process and the things we could not see. After talking, she immediately popped up and put her superhero design tools to workâher x-ray vision which saw through walls, and her tape measure.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial sketches removed the wall between the kitchen and the dining area completely, as well as part of the wall between the kitchen and the living room. We were seeking to strike a balance between Joshuaâs partiality to completely open spaces and my desire to keep some visual privacy. Receptive to our decision to keep the entire wall between the living room and kitchen intact, the plan removed only the wall between the kitchen and the dining area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our contractorâs keen eye helped us ask so many more questions about the space. I never noticed that the sightlines of our parquet floors were uneven and misaligned. (Joshua was right. We needed to replace the floors.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22219" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Erica_Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that the space would be transformed in ways I was not expecting the moment she began to speak of light from the kitchen window spilling into the back corner of the living room. With the wall down, of course, the kitchen window would be visible as you enter the apartment. The decision to move the refrigerator out of the original kitchen footprint into what was once a hallway closet provided more options on where the sink and dishwasher could be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that our Sweeten contractor had expertise in millwork. Our kitchen, filled with unexpected nooks and crannies, was a design dilemma that custom cabinetry could solve. I envisioned white cabinetry to brighten up the kitchen, and we trusted our contractorâs desire to include natural wood via open shelving and some cabinetry with a walnut finish. The shelving she created is the perfect platform for us to display our spices, cookbooks, vases, and the all-important pilon for grinding plantains.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. âIâm so nervous,â I admitted.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a designer, she not only considered ways to bring more storage and surface area into the kitchen, but also a new hue. One afternoon we perused our choices at their warehouse in Queens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every tile seemed to fall shortâwrong tint, incorrect size, too dominating, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Joshuaâs eye caught a simple hexagonal tile of soft turquoise blue. This 3D recycled glass tile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complemented the cabinetry color, the wood finish, and it was the right size. The result is a beautiful canvas that pulls the white cabinetry and quartz countertops together. Last, but certainly not least, it serves as a surprising showcase for my favorite red cast iron Dutch oven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making decisions was easy. Rather than ask us to look at every iteration of countertop or knob, our contractor presented us with a few options, and the design sensibility connected across the space. The nickel handles on the cabinet doors pick up the subtle specks of silver accents in the quartz countertops coordinating well with the steel appliances.Â  I only noticed it once the kitchen was complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to come up with secondary plans for overhead lighting since the ceiling was made of concrete. The</span><a href="https://www.cb2.com/">Â </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor lamp now illuminates our favorite round dining table. The gooseneck sconce creates the perfect corner for working on a laptop at our <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/">kitchen peninsula</a>, which can now accommodate someone cooking at the same time. The peninsula also has generous storage on two sidesâfour very deep drawers and a small cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when you walk into our apartment, three things jump out at you: the welcoming natural light that flows in from the windows, rich wood elements on the cabinetry and shelving, and the turquoise tile of the backsplash.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44834" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erica-Portrait-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The builders and carpenters of our design-build firm are true craftspeople. The care with which they handled each task was notable. They produced perfectly mitered corners, laid the floor with precision, and cleaned up at the end of each day. We felt like we were in good hands the entire way through. Iâd notice an imperfection, and before I could say anything, they had fixed it. Truly top-notch workmanship. They were so thoughtful about the space that it made our decision to stay in the apartment throughout the renovation easy. âJust think of it like camping,â Joshua said one night as we dined in our bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend before demolition day, our contractor came by to finalize things. âIâm so nervous,â I admitted. &#8220;Donât worry,&#8221; she warmly replied. &#8220;Youâre gonna love it.âÂ  Debris and concrete walls filled much of the living area after the first demolition day, but we felt the homeyness of the space. The light from the newly visible window greeted us as we entered in a way we never expected. I looked at Joshua and said, âI didnât realize how much of me was in this place. Now we get to create this space together.â We couldnât relish it more!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When avid entertainers embark on an apartment renovation, itâs sure to lead to greatness in the kitchen. That was the case in this 1940s Brooklyn co-op that Jessica, a brand strategist from London, and Jesse, a filmmaker and content producer from Queens, bought together soon after getting married.

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Guest blog post by Sweeten homeowner Jessica</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our story begins when we started looking for a home, and specifically a kitchen<i>,</i> we could love. We were living happily in Brooklyn in a one-bedroom rental, but after we got married, investing in an apartment for the long-term was our goal. We noticed that well-renovated places coming on the market were triggering bidding wars and started thinking about buying an apartment to redo. Being big foodies, we got excited to build a beautiful kitchen to cook in.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We came across a cluster of buildings called the Clinton Hill Co-ops and were attracted by the generous square footage of the apartments, which were built in the mid-20th century. When a two-bedroom needing updates became available, we snapped it up.Â </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Weâd hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30715" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a>, along with our team from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amyblumenthal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blumenthal Architecture and Interiors</a>. We planned to open up the kitchen to the living room and add a peninsula where we could prepare food or just hang out. Plumbing would be relocated for a better cooking layout. However, a partition surrounding the existing refrigerator closed off the kitchen, disrupting flow.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution: Demo the partition and move the fridge, thereby creating space for a six-foot peninsula. It was designed with full-length drawers for pans and dinnerware, built-in shelves at the end of the peninsula for cookbooks, and toe-level kick-drawers, which let us utilize every inch. It also has a wine fridge! We went for under-cabinet lighting and pull-out components: a pantry, spice rack, and garbage bin.Â </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/colourfulstef/"><span class="s5">Stef Steen,</span></a> a color specialist based in the UK, helped us make minimalist palettes with touches of strong color for soul. Our cabinets are custom, the uppers in white and lowers in dark royal blue. People say not to mix shaker and flat-front cabinets, but we liked the flat style for the drawers, where protruding pulls can be annoying. Weâre not disappointed. We settled on brushed brass cabinet hardwareâafter ordering three different styles. One of our favorite aspects of the kitchen is a graphic tile with dark grouting for the backsplash.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stef made a booklet with Pantone numbers for matching paint, tile, and accessories. We pulled our kitchen colors to other rooms, adding accents in green and yellow.</span><span class="s1">Â </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though we hadn&#8217;t lived in the apartment yet, we thought hard about how weâd use every space. Their contractor took some square footage from the kitchen to widen the hallway making room for a long built-in bookshelf.Â </span><span class="s1">For storage in both bedrooms, separate closets were merged together as a single built-in with full-height doors and shelving.</span></p>
<p>To reach optimal electrical aspirations, layouts and furniture placement were carefully planned for overhead lighting installations in the bedrooms and living rooms. Phone chargers were also built into kitchen drawers and outlets were tucked away for electric toothbrushes and hairdryers in the bathroom.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We rolled with the geometrics, doing graphic tile in the bathroom, too, and pairing it with less expensive, easier-to-clean porcelain. (Itâs no joke when your general contractor says everything must be in stock when purchased. After we were promised timely shipping on the bathroom wall tiles by a retailer, the day came and they werenât there; I spent a stressful morning trying to find something similar.) The tile contrasts nicely with the simple brass fixtures and wood vanity.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the expertise of our construction and design teams, our goals came together in a vibrant space. Our contractor met with us weeklyâor moreâto check on progress and we felt supported knowing we could turn to Sweeten if something went wrong. Jesse and I asked our contractor to copy us both on communications, which worked for us.Â </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeing our space transform and our vision come to life was so thrilling. We love our kitchen and take such pleasure in cooking and entertaining in it.Â </span></p>

<h3>A closed-off Brooklyn kitchen with potential</h3>
<p>A beautiful neighborhood, an optimal layout, and a lot of natural light led Melissa to purchase her corner apartment in Brooklynâs Clinton Hill Co-ops. The literary agent planned to renovate the kitchen and remove walls to take advantage of the light from the living area. Melissa also wanted to reflect the buildingâs mid-century style in her own space. âI wanted mid-century-Scandi-style-kitchen-meets-â70s-Italian-modern with warmer accents in the textiles and color,â she shared. Nearly 14 years after she bought her apartment, Melissa postedÂ her renovation project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. She was <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/brooklyn-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a contractor</a> who helped her bring her kitchen dreams to life. The wait was worth it. (Even <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/scandinavian-white-ikea-kitchen-design-remodel-photos-266002">Apartment Therapy </a>thought so, as they covered the transformation as well!)</p>

<h3>Removing walls to create space in the kitchen</h3>
<div class="desc simple-text tt-content">
<p>Melissa worked with her interior designer, Danielle Herman of Persephoneâs Spring, and a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establish a kitchen plan</a> and open up the space. The walls blocking the kitchen off from the living area were the first to go. Fortunately, the impact was instant: the room immediately brightened up. To take advantage of the newfound light, she chose a mix of materials, including matte <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concrete floor and counters</a>, to balance out the stainless steel appliances. âThe goal was to reflect and refract the natural light,â Melissa shared. White Ikea cabinets and floating shelves contribute to the airy and spacious look.</p>
<p>A new peninsula offers additional seating while a built-in nook holds mugs, trinkets, and books. The location of the appliances remained as-is, but without the walls, the cook space <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a better flow</a>.</p>

<h3>The team brings a Scandi-style kitchen to life</h3>
<p>Melissaâs designer worked hand-in-hand with her Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor executing the vision</a> and selecting finishes, paint colors, and other details. Her contractor also had worked on many apartments in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a>, so he knew what to expect in terms of plumbing and support walls. âHe knew ahead of time where the bodies were buried, so to speak,â Melissa said. He provided a detailed breakdown of the job, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget</a>, and timeline, and &#8220;stuck to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her only regret of the project? <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not doing it sooner</a>. Melissa wakes up every day excited âand delighted to return to cook dinner.â</p>

<h3>Storage space with a Japanese vibe</h3>
<p>Joseph, an immigration lawyer and painter, and Sunghee, a curator and former director of Art Space Pool, a non-profit art space in South Korea, rented their mid-century Clinton Hill co-op in Brooklyn for several years before purchasing it from the owner. They were lucky the 606-square-foot apartment had been modernized before they moved in with new white oak floors, kitchen upgrades, and bath updates with Ikea products. When it became their own, they wanted the home to reflect their modern Japanese aesthetic and to have additional storage space.</p>
<div></div>
<p>They turned to architect Brett Masterson of <a href="https://masterson.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masterson Architecture &amp; Design Co.</a>, who had renovated his own one-bedroom in their building. They were impressed by how he had maximized his even smaller space and created custom storage solutions that disappeared when not in use.</p>

<h3>Integrating lifestyle and function</h3>
<p>The coupleâs main objective for the 44-square-foot area was to open up the closed-off kitchen to the rest of the apartment and, ideally, double their storage space. The marriage of the Japanese aestheticâminimal hardware, natural and warm materialsâwith <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/7-kitchen-storage-solutions-small-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clever organizational solutions</a> drove their vision.Â &#8220;The project was like a renovation version of author Marie KondoâsÂ <a href="https://konmari.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KonMari Method</a><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="â¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for tidying up,&#8221; the architect said.</p>
<p>Brett spent a lot of time understanding how the couple used the space: their lifestyle patterns, what they had for breakfast, and how they spent their evenings. He wanted the renovation to adapt to Sunghee and Joseph&#8217;s routines, while also streamlining their day-to-day through purposeful design and space planning.</p>

<h3>Built-ins and organizational systems</h3>
<p>They faced challenges right away: First, it took a long time for the co-op board to approve the project. Then, the co-op board wouldn&#8217;t allow the wall where the electrical panel and intercom were located to be removed. That limited how open they could make the kitchen on one side. They still were able to open the wall that faced the large living room windows, which meant they could have a direct sightline to the outdoors and add to the open feel. They also flipped the electrical panel to the inside of the kitchen so it wasnât as visible. A base cabinet at the wallâs cut-out that Brett calls âthe landing stripâ is a place to kick off shoes, store keys, wallets, etc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37011 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-07-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The small kitchen didn&#8217;t have enough working space for two people to comfortably prepare a meal together. The compact fridge took up a quarter of the kitchen, so they relocated it to a new adjacent storage wall across the entry hallway. That was aÂ game-changer since it increased the amount of prep space by 200 percent.</p>
<p>The existing storage situation also made the room feel cluttered as well. The couple was storing things in the space between the tops of the cabinets and the ceiling and were keeping things out on the counter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37012 size-full" title="utensil storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction, 44 square foot kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37567" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-15.gif" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>Utilitarian needs and modern looks</h3>
<p>The architect placed a pegboard panel on the outside face of a six-inch deep cabinet (used as a pantry to hold mason jars and cooking ingredients). The board, which holds regularly used items such as a knife block, cooking utensils, a basket of onions, cast iron pans, is only visible when someone is standing by the stove. After things are washed, items can be hung to dry, which skips a stop at the drying rack and helps eliminate clutter. They also separated the cooktop and oven so cooking and baking could be done at the same timeâa benefit they were not expecting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-37540 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14.gif" alt="hidden, refrigerator, kitchen, remodel, renovation, design, construction" width="723" height="1083" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The most important part of the storage solution design was the wall of book-matched white oak cabinets in the entryway. The cabinets look the same from the outside, but each was designed for a specific need: Cabinet one is an entry storage wall with space for shoes, vacuum, dustbin, and microwave; Cabinet two is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel-ready refrigerator</a>; Cabinets three and four are a double-door unit that houses a modular ELFA shelving system that Joseph and Sunghee already owned.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-14-1.gif" alt="Brooklyn, New York City, renovation, remodel, kitchen, 44 square foot kitchen" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>Brett also discovered an unused pocket behind the cabinet wall where they were able to hide a cabinet that is flush with (and blends into) the sheetrock wall. The cabinet opens on the living room side and houses the coupleâs luggage for easy access since Sunghee travels to Korea regularly.</p>
<h3>A limited and complementary palette</h3>
<p>A limited materials palette helped unify the renovated kitchen with the rest of the apartment and complemented the coupleâs furniture and art collection. They primarily used rift-cut white oak for the cabinets and shelving because the flooring, dining table, and bench were white oak. They also chose to paint all the upper cabinets white to lighten the mass of storage cabinets above the sink and blend into the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37017 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg" alt="portrait, homeowner" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Brett-Masterson-apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em>Â Sweeten homeowner, Joseph</span></p>
<p>Brett, Sunghee, and Joseph are all pleased with the way things turned out. The architect had shown the couple plans in 3D to help them visualize how their kitchen would meet their needs and look the way they wanted it to. Ultimately they created âa spot for everything they needed and nothing they didnât,â he said.</p>
<p>They enjoyed selecting lighting and tiles, and Sunghee, in particular, loved seeing the contractor work. (She felt like she was apprenticing at times because she spent so much time watching the construction team.) The architect says that he was excited to try some new, well-made high-end materials, such as Heath ceramic handmade floor tiles (set in a herringbone pattern) and custom lighting.</p>
<h3>Architectural experience</h3>
<p>While this project was a first for Sunghee and Joseph, Brett has renovated more than 20 homes (three of them his own). He offers this advice: âBe prepared to spend 20 percent more and for projects to take 20 percent longer, and don&#8217;t live in the space while work is being done.â But itâs not all cautionary. âYou can splurge on nice things in small spaces without too much of a financial impact on the project.â</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Sunghee, Joseph, and Brett for sharing this beautifulâand smartâspace!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill home gains flexible space with sliding doors</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33864 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02a-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, open shelving, bar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two decades ago, native New Yorkers Margery and Jim Fields worked inÂ Manhattan and lived just outside the city. In 1996, the family relocated to Philadelphia when Jim was transferred for a job. The couple always had a special place in their hearts for New York, and when their kids grew up, they decided it was the right time to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33866 size-chrono" title="Margery and Jim" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-16-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34597 size-chrono" title="view" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NYC-Skyline-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34566 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Floorplan-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they began their search for an NYC home, they wanted something a bit unique. They looked at many listings, but it was theÂ view from their apartment at theÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (a Brooklyn complex near and dear to us here at Sweeten, after renovating so many homes there!) that sold them on the one-bedroomÂ place they ended up purchasing. They loved the sweeping view of Manhattanâthe island that drew them back to the five boroughs.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33868 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33875 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-07-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33867 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, spot lighting, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment itself was a different story. It hadnât beenÂ updated in 40 years and had been chopped up with too many walls. Despite this, they decided that the incredible views were worth the trade-off of having to renovate. After a remodeling of their Philadelphia kitchen several years ago, they had a good idea of a wishlist forÂ their next project. They wisely decided to live in the space for six months before starting the design process to get a feel for how they would use itâand to understand the light&#8217;s effect in the apartment atÂ various times of the day. They heard about <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, from their neighbors, and it kept coming up in conversation. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted their project</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose this Sweeten contractor</a>,Â who had previously done several projects in the Clinton Hill Co-ops.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34564 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-05-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33869 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34108 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-05a-723x484.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, subway tile, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="484" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once discussions got underway, they made some decisions with the help of their Sweeten contractor; prior work in the building meant he knew what was behind the walls and what to anticipate, so was able to guide Margery and Jim on what actions would need to come next in the process. He knew the bathroom ceiling was a drop ceiling and would be able to install the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/kitchen-lighting-101-basics-on-lighting-your-cookspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotlighting</a> they wanted. Their contractor was also familiar with the building&#8217;s wiring and informed them it would not support an induction cooktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The coupleâs design vision was an industrial-yet-modern aesthetic. They wanted to take down the walls boxing in the kitchen and allow as much light into the space as possible. The full scope included a new kitchen and bath as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33873 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-04-723x933.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33872 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-02.gif" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, kitchen, hardwood floors, sliding door, french door, open shelving, stainless steel appliances" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, Margery and Jim planned to convert the dining nook beside the kitchen into a second bedroom but ultimately decided on a flex-space solution made possible by sliding doors. When they didnât need the second bedroom, the doors could remain open to take full advantage of the two large windows in the nook. The contractor created aÂ custom solution by fusing two estate-sale-find French doors that Margery and JimÂ had found to make a sliding pocket door. The renovated nook is now a seating area that can be closed off from the living room to createÂ a guest sleeping area that feels like aÂ âstudio within the apartment,â explained Margery. It is also a cozy spot for guests to perch when the pair entertain and are preparing food in the kitchen. (Given that Jim has seven brothers who are all married, they definitely need the seating for guests!)</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33876 mb-0 size-chrono" title="long-blue-kitchen-cabinet-peninsula" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-03.gif" alt="long blue kitchen cabinet with knob and white kitchen peninsula with cabinets after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the kitchen revamp, Jim and Margery decided on dark gray cabinets paired with a light quartz countertop and glass subway tile. The contractor suggested a full-lengthÂ <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pantry</a> next to the refrigerator on the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, providing unexpected bonus storage. On the other side of the fridge, open shelving is built onto a mirrored backsplash for maximum light reflection into the kitchen. Corner shelving was added, with a Lazy Susan to maximize under-counter spaceÂ leaving enough room for a full-size dishwasher.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple intended to add a kitchen island at first. But when they saw how open the space felt without it, theyÂ chose to leave it as is. Similarly, the original design called for stainless steel shelving to be added to the back wall above the sink but decided to leave it open for an airier feel overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33882 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-Before-06-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33881 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33879 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-JimFields_Kitchen-Bath-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, clinton hill co-op, bathroom, large-format tiles, vinyl tub, bronze penny floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Margery and Jim were able to make use of another estate sale findâthe black large-format tiles, which cost a dollar a piece. They pairedÂ those tiles with an unusual bronzeÂ <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny tile</a> Margery had once seen and admired in a restaurant.Â A cast-iron tub was swapped out for a vinyl one that allowed the contractor to bring the wall tile around the front to tie the space together. Modern Brizo fixtures helped toÂ finish the clean, streamlined look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that their project is complete, Margery and Jim have a few words of wisdom for would-be renovators. They stress the importance of selecting the right contractorâone with whom you can have a good âcommunication cadence,â said Margery. âWe would text or talk to our contractor multiple times a week, or multiple times a day as things came up. That ability to instantly communicate would keep things from being delayed or misinterpreted.â They love the openness of the new layout, &#8220;while keeping some separation between the kitchen and main living space,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad we didn&#8217;t take out the bar/pantry wall.&#8221; Check out their Behind-The-Reno video below:</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26201 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation ideas" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Cartier_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Bringing a dilapidated <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bath</a> into the 21stÂ century in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Last week, we saw how Natalie and Cartier transformed the <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/perfect-custom-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen and living room</a>Â of their one-bedroom apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops. Their bathroom was in a similar state of disrepairÂ from a rust-stained bathtub and matching sinkÂ to the peeling, flowery wallpaper and lavender tiles that were not to the coupleâs taste at all. With the help of theirÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten contractor</a>, they implemented a set of bathroom renovation ideas that contrasted white tiles with dark grout for a look thatâs thoroughly modern.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: As in the rest of the apartment, Natalie and Cartier created a clean, streamlined look by combining white tile, flat-front cabinetry in a dark wood finish, and chrome Grohe fixtures. The choice of a 4â x 12â subway tile for the walls gave the bath a more contemporary look than the traditional 3â x 6â subway tile. The couple chose a dark grout for contrast and paired it with charcoal <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a> in porcelain tile. Sleek bar <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a> and recessed lights maintained the unfussy look. The space was a typical NYC bathroom, which meant that they had to maximize <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage space</a> without it feeling too cramped. Another one of their bathroom renovation ideas involved two niches built into the wall of the shower to provide a convenient area for storing bath products. An <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA sink and vanity</a> helped to keep the cost down while the pair splurged on a thermostatic <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower system</a> that includes a rain shower, a handheld showerhead, as well as a faucet. They decided on the thermostatic shower valves because of bad experiences in past apartments with drastic changes in shower temperature, and this technology addressed that problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: CartierÂ hated the way that shower curtains got dingy over time (no matter how diligent you were about airing them out!). As a result, he was particularly excited about the glass partition between the tub and the sink which simplifies the task of cleaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Porcelain floor tile, PT 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; Basaltina Linosa (cut into squares): <a href="https://www.arizonatile.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Tile</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A closed-in footprint cracksÂ wide open with a floor plan change, a dramatic tile backsplash, and a new dining area</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25802 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen with tile backsplash" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Matthieu_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="tile backsplash" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Project</b></span>: Modernizing and improving flow in an awkward kitchen in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Before</b></span>: This Sweeten homeowner purchased a two-bedroom co-op apartment in Clinton Hill about a year and a half before posting his project to Sweeten. Although the kitchen was functional, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layout</a> was not ideal. There was a mishmash of storage, none of which was adequate, and walls lacked definition without a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/5-tile-trends-every-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile backsplash</a>. Only a small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peninsula</a> provided the bulk of the work surface. He also wanted to add built-in <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinetry</a> for additional storage. With all of this in mind, the homeownerâa first-time renovatorâenlisted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten contractor</a> to convert his vision into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>After</b></span>: A bright, contemporary kitchen in subtle tones pairs perfectly with a coral accent wall that runs along one side of the kitchen and through the living room. A glass tile backsplash in a mosaic of gray shades is the star of the show. By choosing stainless steel appliances, white cabinets, silver hardware, and a medium gray quartz countertop, the homeowner created a clean backdrop for both the tile backsplash as well as for it to coordinate with the home&#8217;s open plan. Given that the new base cabinetryâwith many deep drawersâprovide plenty of hidden storage, chunky white shelving was installed instead ofÂ upper cabinets for a feeling of openness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Bonus</b></span>: By reconfiguring the kitchen from a U-shape to a galley setup, the Sweeten contractor made way for a dining space with an ample-sized table that easily seats 6 (or more!), and is directly in front of the kitchenâs large window to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Style finds</b></span>:Â Glass mosaic backsplash,Â white flat-front cabinets, gray quartz countertops, silverÂ cabinet hardware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A Clinton Hill renovation brings upgrades from the kitchen to a tough wood flooring decision</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British expat Sam and her American husband, Sean, had been living in Park Slope for several years when they made the decision to find a place to buy. While they casually searched in Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods, they also prepared their finances and readied themselves for when it came time to make an offer. A fortuitous series of events led them to bid onâand win!âthe first apartment they visited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten <span class="s1">shares</span> their (enviably easy) search and how they transformed a long-empty, rundown apartment into a beautiful home for a growing family.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and supportâfor free.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Having heard horror stories from friends who suffered through multiple failed bids, Sam and Sean anticipated a difficult process. They imagined that they might also face rejection, so they jumped into the process with an offer after their first open house visit in the nearby Clinton Hill neighborhood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They realized that the space was old and hadnât been lived in for quite some time, but were able to see past the grimy kitchen and bath, as well as the worn floors and peeling paint in this two-bedroom apartment in the famed Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weâre big fans</a>, as you know). The large bedrooms were a big plus, while the generous common area could open up even further by removing walls separating the kitchen from the dining and living rooms. Otherwise, the size and layout were exactly right for their family of four, and they would remain within commuting distance to their daycare. The listed price also left room in their budget forÂ the renovation the apartment so desperately needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When the discussion came around to renovation at the Open House, the listing agent, <span style="color: #000000;">Tom Stuart</span>Â (who coincidentally also lived in the CHCs), mentioned that Sweeten would be an option for their project, given the ever-growing list of Sweeten alumni in the complex. So as they went into contract, SamÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> and requested bids from contractors. A Sweeten contractor fit the bill, and they got to work updating the apartment after a slight delay in obtaining approval from the board and managing agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create a feeling of spaciousness, walls were knocked down to open sight lines between all of the common areas. (With two kids under five, this was especially important.) Sam wanted the kitchen to feel as large as possible by New York City standards, since the couple cooks frequently. The contractor closed off one of the openings between the hallway and the kitchen, so that a pantry and refrigerator could be installed in that space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the opposite side of the kitchen, in place of the old walls framing the dining area, a peninsula was installed for additional counter space and storage. The sink was moved out of a cramped corner, and placed alongside the dishwasher for ease of access. Sam chose to go with stock cabinets for the affordability factor. (Also, by this point, they learned that Sam was pregnant with their third child, meaning that this was unlikely to be their forever home!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the palette, soothing neutrals provided a subtle backdrop to the inevitable and colorful chaos that always accompanies kids and their toys. In terms of storage, the full-length pantry was outfitted with pull-out drawers for maximum accessibility. Drawers were also installed in the peninsula instead of shelves. The kitchen design also included a Lazy Susan in the upper corner, so that hard-to-reach items in the back wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Lastly, an integrated garbage bin kept the trash out of sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deciding early on they did not want the hassle of obtaining plumbing permits, the couple left the fixtures in their original locations and instead focused on finding brighter, cleaner replacement options. They carried the same neutral look in the small bathroom, installing open shelving, a large mirror, and a metal-legged console sink to reduce the feeling of clutter. Behind the mirror is a spacious medicine cabinet for toiletries. And although a console sink meant no storage underneathâa brave choice for a family bathroom!âSam reports that theyâve had no problems on that front, given the large hallway closet right outside the bath. For tile, a classic white subway tile on the walls and a subtly-patterned cement tile on the floor set a tranquil feel, while Pottery Barn lighting rounded out the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the rest of the apartment, the coupleâs Sweeten contractor also refinished the floors and installed carpet over the hardwood in the bedrooms. Sam confides that it was Seanâs preference and she was initially unswayed, knowing it would be a controversial choice. But having lived with it now for a few months, they love the softness underfoot, especially for playing with their kids. (Plus, the wood remains intact and an option for restoration in the future.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the two closets in the master bedroom were combined into one, and the entire apartment wasÂ <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/skim-coating-in-5-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim-coated</a> and repainted. One thing that Sam wished they had doneâand are now in the process of doingâwas to paint and finish the undersides of the cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23093 size-full" title="Clinton Hill Brooklyn renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Samantha_Kitchen_Bathroom-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, the duo attempted to visit the work site regularly. In fact, this is her tip to future renovators: âGo to the apartment every week, at the very least. At first, we only visited on the weekends, when we had time. But the contractors werenât working then. We realized that checking in at some point during working hours was a huge help, and that things went more smoothly when we did that, even though it was a pain. We could discuss issues as they came up, and see what they were talking about.â The renovation was completed within four months, allowing them to turn their attention to their next major project, a new baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thanks to Sam, Sean, Ellie, Ernie, and baby Alice, for sharing your home! We hope that youâll make some great memories in that gorgeous space. (Special thanks to Sam for sending over the list of resources on her due date!)</em></p>

<p><em>Guest post by Kristen, Clinton Hill homeowner</em></p>
<p>Before moving to Clinton Hill, I lived in a 450-square-foot studio apartment in Brooklyn Heights for 10Â years. I adored that apartment, but was ready to move into a new space after maneuvering around a small home that had few windows and limited space for entertaining. This apartment, a co-op in the Clinton Hill Co-ops (<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a complex with considerable Sweeten history!</a>) is nearly twice as large at 800 square feet, and had been converted to a two-bedroom by the previous owners. I closed on this apartment in August 2016, andÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/14351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project to Sweeten</a>.Â <span class="s1">I had been looking at the site for a few months even before I found my apartment so by the time I was ready to start construction I had a clear sense of how the process worked.Â </span><span class="s1">Once I selected a contractor, the team at Sweeten checked in to make sure things were progressing.Â </span><span class="s2">My <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SweetenÂ contractor</a> and the architect made themselves available to come to the apartment multiple times before I closed so we could discuss the best options for my space. They presented a range of design ideas that addressed my needs/wants and they were always clear and upfront about costs and time frame.Â </span></p>
<p>IÂ lived in my apartment for about eight weeks before construction beganÂ which allowed me to learn a bit about the space before making final decisions. I saw the apartment in the summer, so I knew the potential of the strong, natural light that existed and which areas needed a boost. I couldÂ consider how I&#8217;d like to live in each section of the space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22489 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg" alt="Kristen-Floorplan" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kristen-Floorplan-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My main objective was to open up the kitchen. A wall between the kitchen and living room dampened all the light, while a second wall featured a window frame-type of cutout with an awkward shoulder-height countertop. By knocking down the walls, the kitchen would open up into the dining and living areas, allowing those spaces to flow more easilyâfrom workspace to entertaining to relaxation. Additional overhead lighting would brighten up the space even more.</p>

<p>I cook often and my priority for the kitchen was to install a peninsula with large, deep drawers so I could easily store large pots and pans and not keep them in the oven! It would provide substantial work space, and allow for an easy transitional section for entertaining. While they probably seem like minor choices, I think sliding double drawers for utensils and a separate spice cabinet were<span style="color: #000000;"> a</span> good use of space soÂ items are readily accessible. Lastly, my previous building didn&#8217;t allow for a dishwasher, so being able to have one was a massive step up and a life-changing purchase!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My overall vision for the space was a bright, crisp but serene environment. I have worked in commercial art galleries for the past 17 years, so the artwork I own is really what I want to be the focal point of every space. I wanted the surroundings to quietly complement the art on view, and I think the clean lines really set up a solid framework to showcase the things I love.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, I wanted a modern, warm and clean kitchen that could serve as a neutral backdrop for any display of accessories, ceramics, or statement pieces. The previous cabinets were a wood color that dulled the natural light, and I chose instead a classic white shaker-style cabinet that worked nicely withÂ the modern lines used elsewhere in the apartment. More functional than marble, the quartz countertop features traditional light gray veining that goes well with the gray variations of the flooring. Of all the choices to be made, I had the most difficult time finding a backsplash tile I liked; most were too clinical and slick or seemed dated. My Sweeten contractor brought me to a tile vendor for more options, and in the course showed me the material he had recently installed in his own full bath. Although he had used it as flooring, I really responded to the matte surface and the subtle geometric shape. Also on my wishlist was stainless steel appliances. I love that the oven is flush with the countertop with no back panel or raised display, enhancing the kitchenâs clean lines. I decided on brass hardware which doesn&#8217;t match the appliances, but the gold tones of the metal add another dimension without making things busy.</p>

<p>In addition to the kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the storage in the apartment. The interiors of some closets were refinished and cleaned up after years of use, while two bedroom closets were merged into one large one. The bathroom received an upgrade with a new sink, vanity and medicine cabinet. What makes me happiest is nowÂ there is a place for everything. In my old apartment, everything I owned had to serve severalÂ functionsâthe coffee table was also hidden storage, the closets were jammed with paperwork, clothing, cleaning products, and pantry items. My current apartment is so well organized; my beautiful bedroom closet makes me want to keep everything in its place.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge was patience. When you start a project like this, it can be very daunting if you have never done it before. I chose to live in the apartment while work was done, and while I wouldn&#8217;t change that decision, I think it took a toll. It was great to see the progress being made every day, but there are only so many nights you can be comfortable sleeping in plaster dust or having dinner behind a big plastic sheet. Doing construction in New York City has its trialsâlike getting to all the supply stores without a car. My Sweeten contractor and his crew doing the work on a daily basis were understanding and accommodating and that definitely lessened the stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I came into the renovation with many questions about timeframe and finances. I had heard horror stories about contractors abandoning jobs and I was fearful that I&#8217;d end up paying for an incomplete job. The members on my contractorâs team, however each were helpful in different ways. I really benefited from the experience and opinions of multiple people. The job wasn&#8217;t huge overall, but they treated me with respect, and knew this was a significant decision for me. They were all realistic about my options, pricing, and the pros/cons of different materials. It was challenging to keep everything straight, but anytime things went off course they were quickly corrected.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I was a bit nervous that I&#8217;d have a difficult time making so many decisions. There are infinite outlets for design and it&#8217;s easy to be overwhelmed even if you have a clear sense of your own style. Stay true to your goals and make decisions for your space that will benefit you every day. I learned that it pays off to do something bold even if it is small: the kitchen isÂ neutral because it opens up into my living area, but the second bedroom didnât face the same constraints. I painted it a dark green and love sitting in that space. In the end, I worried less about creating a showplace, and came away with a home that I am proud of and that suits me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><em>When Amanda and her husband set out to upgrade from their two-bedroom Windsor Terrace apartment in Brooklyn, they had a few adjectives in mindâlight, airy, warm. They loved the neighborhood as well as the great lightÂ in their rental, but as work-from-home writers, desiredÂ larger bedrooms and a more spacious kitchen. They had also just gotten married, and if youâve ever had a registry, you understand why they needed more kitchen storage! Hereâs the story of how a visit with friends led them to aÂ new home, and how an irresistible pattern sparked their kitchen design.</em></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22363 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="565" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-723x565.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-300x235.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1-600x469.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Amandaâs initial intention was to stay in Windsor Terrace, the direction of her apartment search changed when she and her husband visited some friends at their new home in the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/chc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton Hill Co-ops</a> (CHC). They loved the feel of the complex and the apartment space itself, and realized that this was where they wanted to be. After a few months of checking out CHC listings as they came on the market, the couple landed a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment. Coincidentally, it was the mirror image of the one their friends owned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As writers who both work from home, Amanda and her husband appreciated that the two bedrooms were equally sized; one could be used as a roomy home office as well as guest quarters forÂ out-of-town visitors. Â At around 1,000 square feet, the unit also had southern exposures that provided the lovely, warm light they had beenÂ in search of. The only issue was the kitchen: it was dark and closed off, and connected to a strange pass-through pantry that housed a bar counter. Although it had been recently renovated, the craftsmanship was poor, as thereÂ were already cracks and scratches in the cabinetry and flooring. At first sight, Amanda thought it would be a deal-breaker. She was eager forÂ a simple move, and very hesitant to embark on a renovation of any kind. But slowly, she and her husband talked themselves into itâafter all, the apartment was ideal in every other way.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22336 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-Before-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So as they began the process of closing on the apartment, Amanda <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their kitchen renovation</a> to Sweeten. As a first-time renovator, she wasnât sure how to decide between the various bids. Our in-house team came to the rescue: a call with one of Sweetenâs project advisors proved to be useful. The chat gave Amanda the chance to think out loud and consider the pros and cons of each bid, and she selected herÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/338020 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-09" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22338 mb-24 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22340 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-03-04" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amandaâs vision for the kitchen reflected the feeling she wantedÂ for the apartment as a whole: clean and bright, but not too modern or sterile. âWe both love to cook and wanted to feel comfortable there, like we could make a mess,â Amanda explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They began by knocking down the walls that separated the kitchen and pantry from the living room and dining nook. (This is a common theme in the CHC kitchens! For more inspiration, check outÂ Laura and Matthewâs <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>, as well as Mario and Joeâs <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.) One of the doorways from the kitchen to the hallway was closed off to extend the kitchen space across the entire wall. In a brilliant move, their Sweeten contractor turned the unused space next to the refrigerator into diagonal built-in shelving, now the perfect spot to display photos and items from their travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the space was opened up, the couple turned their attention to the details. Early on, Amanda fell in love with a Mediterranean-inspired patterned tile in black, grey and white, and built the entire kitchen design to complement it. Although she had originally considered the tile as a backsplash, it made more sense as flooringâa wise suggestion from her mom. For the millwork, their Sweeten contractor sourced custom cabinetry with simple lines in a white shaker style. A singleÂ set of glass doors wasÂ installed to break the solid run of uppers. A rich walnut countertop was chosen for an added layer of dramaâthey had first considered using a lighter wood, but the darker wood coordinated better with the floors, a decision supported by their contractor. Although <span style="color: #000000;">the work surfaceÂ requires</span> some upkeep, Amanda reports that she âadores them!â Brass knobs and pulls for the cabinets were next, along with a vintage-inspired metal light fixture for the ceiling. While they keptÂ their fairly new appliances from the apartmentâs previous renovation, they addedÂ a wine fridge next to the dishwasher.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22342 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22341 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-05-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, Amanda worked with her Sweeten contractor to resolve issues as they arose. In one incident, the cabinetmaker realized that the measurements had been off, and that a cabinet would have been essentially unusable because of an immovable obstruction. He worked with the contractor to revise the layout overnight, and went into production with very little delay. Aside from this challenge, things went mostly according to plan, not to mention the shortest wait time for board approval that weâve ever heardâabout two weeks! (Could it be because Sweeten has done dozens of renovations in her building?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that theyâre done, Amanda has words of wisdom for aspiring renovators: âDonât rush the process. We were impatient and moved all our things in right after the demolition stage. This meant that all of our belongings went into one bedroom, stacked and wrapped in plastic. We went to stay with our in-laws for the duration of the project. Our contractor was very understanding and worked quickly, but didnât cut corners and finished on scheduleâit took about a month in the end. Although this didnât happen with us, a hurried contractor might be tempted to be less detailed-oriented. Trust the contractor! He knows what heâs doing and how long itâll take to do it.â</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22343 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08-1-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-08" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22339 size-chrono" title="Clinton Hill kitchen renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Amanda_Kitchen-02" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a book lover, Amandaâs one regret is that they didnât think to carve out space in the wall shared between the kitchen and the hallway for built-in bookshelves. Still, as a first-time renovator, we think she did an amazing job, and like other Sweeten clients, she can always return for another renovation someday!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you, Amanda, for sharing this lovely space. We hope that you and your husband enjoy cooking up your next literary masterpieces.</em></p>

			<h3>Planning a multipurpose room</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a one-bedroom work for their four-person family, Casey and Kumar closely examined routines and patterns in their daily lives. Their sons, Luc and River, needed quiet when they went off to bed early each night. Their toys and play area tended to colonize space so it made sense for the master bedroom to become the nursery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Casey and Kumar also focused on optimizing the living space. It needed to feel as open as possible, preserve natural light, and allow typically distinct spaces to share square footage and core functions. The designers posted their project on Sweeten. They were introduced to a Sweeten general contractor who helped bring the coupleâs collaborative drawings to life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54540 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="648" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-16-600x389.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54547 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-30.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p>The biggest challenge, having assigned the only bedroom to their children, was locating their own. They designed a multipurpose room of custom millwork containing a pull-down bed. A surround of retracting walls allowed them to swap sleep space for play and work space as well as an entertaining area.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54538 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="660" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-14-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54539 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="661" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-300x198.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-15-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Integrating the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The designers envisioned an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a> as a central part of the main shared space. The prep and cooking utility would transition without making visual disruptions into the dining and living area. They decided to forgo upper cabinets to keep sightlines clear across the space. The millwork, in a striking combination of natural wood and stone materials, dressed up to resemble a piece of furniture. Soapstone countertops and backsplash and slate floor tiles added functionality and a dark tone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54527 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54534 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>The ultimate kitchen pantry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The understated wall of square doors next to it opened an intricate array of pull-out compartments dedicated to specific uses. Before drawing the kitchen cabinets, Casey and Kumar documented the exact storage requirements they needed to accommodate, to guarantee a precise fit. Finally, they situated the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/how-panel-ready-refrigerators-change-a-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel ready refrigerator</a>, freezer, and pantry just across from the kitchen, as a single integrated design. It also conceals the apartmentâs only structural column.</p>
<p>All of this works together to allow the kitchen to be a social space. Or on display as a backdrop to the life of the dining and sitting areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54528 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54536 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="656" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12-300x197.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-12-600x394.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54537 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="658" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13-300x197.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-13-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54535 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="791" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11-300x237.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-11-600x475.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>A classic and comfortable bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, Casey and Kumar aimed for a general upgrade. It would complement the buildingâs modernist design origins. They chose classic fixtures with simple shapes and Inca black stone mosaic floor tile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-54523 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1431" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-210x300.jpg 210w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-01-600x859.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1475" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-54526" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-203x300.jpg 203w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-03-600x885.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-54524 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3404-Casey-and-Kumar-Apt-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Modern and historical outcome</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Across the board, Casey and Kumar wanted to avoid glossing over the history and character of their building with a layer of ânewness&#8217;. They kept the finishes in line with what was there before. By picking up on material cues from their favorite furnishings, the family was able to infuse many technical design decisions with uncharacteristic and inspiring warmth!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg and Kelly were right where they wanted to be. The couple had just closed on a sought-after two-bedroom in a very popular Brooklyn co-op. But there was a big nagging problem lurking in the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; of their home: severely dated decor wrapped in really bad wiring. The new homeowners just couldnât focus on a future in their new apartment when the kitchen was so obviously stuck in the dark. Read on down for Greggâs take on their sleek new kitchen renovation! </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/gregg-kellys-sweetened-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17774" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg" alt="gregg-kitchen" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gregg-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Gregg, Brooklyn homeowner</span></i><span id="more-17761"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For about one year, Kelly and I searched all over Brooklyn to not only find the perfect apartment, but also the perfect neighborhood. The more we saw, the more our search started to narrow to Clinton Hill and the Clinton Hill Co-ops in particular. Located on what I think is one of the most beautiful streets in Brooklyn, the Clinton Hill Co-op campus had everything we were looking for: a sensible layout, sturdy prewar structure, and great value for the money.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We zeroâd in on a two-bedroom unit that was in need of a lot of work. Many of the apartments in the Co-ops have been renovated before; this one never had and it was a mess. In fact, it was so untouched that even the light switches were still push button rather than actual switches. But, having seen numerous posts on Sweeten, we knew the potential of the space and had a vision for what it could be. The first and most important thing for us to get to was the kitchen and dining room area. We </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and found </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Mick</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help us with the project.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17773" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few things we really wanted. First, we wanted something light and airy. Our old apartment only had two windows and both were in constant shadow, so we wanted something that really allowed the light to filter into the living space. We also wanted a place that we could host people in and have a couple of different gathering spots. And finally, I wanted a place that would be easy to cook in and easy for storage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick guided us through all that needed to be done, had suggestions along the way about how to make the space work even better, and let us know what to expect as things went on. We were lucky to have someone who was so honest and upfront as the apartment was in such bad shape. For instance, after knocking down some of the walls, we really got to see how bad some of the wiring was. Mick walked us through the options and took care of everything. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Gregg_Kitchen-During-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With walls down and new wiring installed, we were ready for the fun stuff. We wanted finishes that were clean and bright, again to allow the sunlight to come in and to make it feel fresh and open. We decided to go with modern white IKEA cabinets because of the solid quality and affordable pricing. Mick, as someone who normally creates custom cabinetry, was able to really help us design a plan that would make the cabinets not feel so cookie-cutter. For the countertops, we went with honed black granite because we wanted the look of a soapstone or black marble, but with a little more durability. The stone looks fantastic and is really a great contrast to the high-gloss cabinets. It was Mick who recommended we get a counter-depth fridge in order to keep things more open with clean lines. It turned out to be a great recommendation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put in new wood floors ourselves that I think bring some much needed warmth to the space. They are engineered floors and we really liked that they felt lived-in but not in a way that seemed artificial. We wanted something that was matte, had character, but would also be durable. This flooring ticked off all of those boxes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, we couldnât be more thrilled with the results. The before and after photos really tell the tale. Mick was able to do a fantastic job&#8211;and on budget. Not only that, he has an attention to detail that is very hard to find in many NYC contractors. Most contractors are concerned with getting the job done and that is it &#8211; Mick is concerned with getting the job done and getting it done right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been several months since the renovation and we both still say âwe canât believe this is actually our apartmentâ.</p>

<span class="img-label"> Guest post by Deniz, Clinton Hill homeowner</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Clinton Hill apartment is part of a large co-op building right between Myrtle and Willoughby on Clinton Avenue. We purchased our one-bedroom in 2000 &#8212; it&#8217;s on the 12th floor and has wonderful views of Brooklyn, including all three bridges. It had been updated in the standard format of all the apartments remodeled by the co-op and had a closed-in kitchen with a sliding door, plus a pantry directly across from the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband, Ramon, had long had the idea of opening up the kitchen but we didnât really update anything as 15 years went by. Fast-forward to 2015 and we now had a teenage son. We were basically âlivingâ in the living room, allowing him the privacy of the bedroom. While it could have been the other way around, we enjoyed having access to the kitchen and living area once he was asleep, and we liked that when his friends came over, they had their own room for play.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17321 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17320" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SWEETEN_Deniz_Kitchen-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we had the opportunity to fully renovate the apartment, we stumbled across <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a>, and met this Sweeten architect and designer.Â Our architect really listened to my husband&#8217;s years of thinking of the best ways to open up and restructure the apartment. He was able to help us accomplish what we ultimately wanted, which was to create a large and open kitchen that highlighted our views, and brought light from all the windows into the space.Â The architect skillfully designed the space and helped us work with our limitations. After all, no matter how many walls we tore down, it&#8217;s still less than 1,000 square feet, and space is always an issue.Â The architect designed the living room to be completely convertible so that we could use it as a bedroom and/or open living space for guests or dancing (our favorite way to spend time together).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to invest in new floors as our existing floors were quite pockmarked and difficult to find replacement tiles for quick fixes. I am a former modern dancer and soft, even floors that I can feel my bare feet on and dance and move on are something that I have always dreamed of having in my home. I really wanted the kitchen floors to match the rest of the apartment and knew it was possible to do that with the right kind of wood floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I fell in love with the Madera Trade floor samples and we chose a light color/tone to brighten the apartment and make it look large. We also invested in the countertops and backsplash in the kitchen, choosing granite in Brown Antique. These materials, along with a Viking stove and Fisher &amp; Paykel double-drawer dishwasher and wine cooler, were the high dollar investments. We went with IKEA cabinets as custom design was too expensive for our budget. We also soundproofed with sub-flooring, added soundproofing in two of our walls, and brought in a number of lighting fixtures (including some old Tiffany stained-glass shades that Ramon restored).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love the easy maintenance of the floors. They are amazingly strong, and because of the way they are made (see Madera Trade details), they don&#8217;t scratch or stain. The stone countertop is also an object of daily appreciation, with easy maintenanceÂ thatÂ will last and last. After a year in the apartment, it still looks brand new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sweeten was easy to use and helped us find our fit easily. The architect and his team worked quickly to get the design completed and he helped us navigate finding the right crew for the job. Our contractors were highly professional and were here every day, essentially keeping to the time allotted. We did have some budgetary limits, and since we invested in some expensive materials, we have yet to complete the interior paneling which will ultimately create a convertible living room space. We are taking our time with the interior aspects and consider that a &#8220;phase two&#8221; of the project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we love the open space, the light, and the energetic flow of the apartment. We still have some decisions to make about the space, and since we are here long term, we are in no rush.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Laura uploaded seventeen âbeforeâ photos to her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/4142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten project post</a>, a few things were very clear: if you could look past the black-paint-encrusted kitchen cabinets and cracked purple bath tiles, these Aussie expatsÂ had the makings of a spacious apartment with oversized windows in one of Brooklynâs loveliest little neighborhoods. But the homeâs tight nooks made it hard to even get a clear âbeforeâ photo of any one room. The layout was segmented with lots of little walls and doors, the parquet flooring had long ago given way, and the bathroom was filled with miniaturized fixtures. With sights set on a summer wedding and jugglingÂ all of the budget demands that come with new homeownership, we introduced Laura and Matthew to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a> for a kitchen, bathroom, ceiling, and flooring renovation in their Clinton Hill co-op!</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>&#8220;This was definitely a dream on a budget and our contractor and his incredible team really made that happen! The Sweeten process and people were amazing and we really can&#8217;t thank them enough for all of their help. We are gearing up for 70 Australians to come to our wedding &#8211; SO SO excited to show them what we have created!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8211; Laura, Brooklyn homeowner</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The plans were ambitious but clear: demolish the kitchen wall to unite the kitchen, dining, and living rooms, re-build cabinetry and replace all finishes, gut the bathroom, clear out popcorn ceilings, and redo the floors. The demolition would leave a support column in place and center entertaining and seating around a new island, all in an entirely upgradedÂ space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tired parquet flooring came up and warm wood planks went down in their place. The original kitchen cabinets appeared to have been painted many times overâwhen Laura and Matthew adopted them they were thick with black paint. The couple had put in long hours at Ikea to designÂ new cabinets, andÂ their contractor&#8217;s team did the heavy lifting to install double lines of cabinetry inÂ dove gray with brushed brassÂ pulls. A large island now separates the kitchen from the living room, while offering bar seating, plenty of table space for entertaining, and hidden storage underneath. Mismatched counters were replaced with striking butcher block, and the sink was swapped for a deep stainless version with a tall, elegant faucet. Laura and Matthew chose an ivory honeycomb backsplash with gray grout and upgraded appliances to sleek stainless steel.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Ohhh, look! There&#8217;s that iconic Clinton Hill Co-op kitchen windowâ¦!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">TheÂ bathroom had also presumably seen kinder days. The floor consisted of gray tiles accented with smaller black and white pieces arranged in an art deco pattern, providing plenty of creative inspiration to work with while maintaining a familiar color theme throughout the home.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team removed the bathroom door and re-created the entry with a sliding track doorâa huge space-saving move.Â Laura and Matthew chose stark all-white subway wall tiles lined with contrasting gray grout to replace the former lavender ones&#8211;many of them broken. The tub stayed with a glaze refresh and gained a large rain showerhead and new fixtures. The big surprise in the bathroom came in the form of a brightly lacquered red vanity, adding a serious punch of color and modernity. A double-sided mirrored medicine cabinet brings extra storage, and strip lighting was upgraded to a streamlined bulb set. The newly expanded vanity carves out just enough room for a simple two-piece white porcelain toilet.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s work in the bedroom was more cosmetic but equally transformative. The building&#8217;s corner beams and beautiful windows are the focal point now that the popcorn ceilings and parquet floors are gone!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Previous Sweeten renovators return for finishing touches: a fresh kitchen, living room, master bedroom</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-14499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg" alt="clinton hill coops" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marioapt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario, who works in media, and Joe, who works in healthcare, bought their one-bedroom co-op in 2013 and spent a year learning their way around its many nooks and crannies. The original space had lots of doors and walls that kept the kitchen and pantry closed off from the living and dining rooms, blocking windows and hiding just how much square footage was actually in play. Mario geared up for a full renovation that would bring walls down and open the space up, and Joe plotted the demise of the apartmentâs dark parquet floors. They <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a>Â and choseÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> to execute on their vision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14486" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14485" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt_Before-01-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting in the kitchen, their contractorÂ demo&#8217;edÂ walls to let light in from this apartmentâs signature corner windows. They couldnât move a structural column so it became the visual marker for the new kitchenâs expanded lines. Maybe surprisingly, they brought down the kitchen ceiling a few inches to make roomÂ for recessed lighting and to demarcate the newly open spacesÂ â raising the ceiling seems to be the goal in many renovations, but you can see where a few inches of lost height made complete sense here. Mario and Joe choseÂ <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/kitchen-cabinets-fronts-24254/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEAâs now-classic white lacquer cabinetry</a>Â and sourced contemporary cabinet pulls fromÂ <a href="https://cabinetparts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinetparts.com</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14495" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-14-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14494" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg" alt="clinton hill coop" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SWEETEN_MarioApt-13-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their contractor helped design the new kitchen island to allow access from both sides. The island is unusually large and far from the kitchen wall, but with drawers on both sides (plus aÂ <a href="https://www.goedekers.com/Summit-CL24WC2.html?utm_source=Amazon&amp;utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_campaign=CL24WC2&amp;zmam=34103103&amp;zmas=2&amp;zmac=231&amp;zmap=Summit-CL24WC2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summit wine fridge</a>), it manages to be kitchen-focused on one end with a great work-space option on the other. Mario and Joe decided to keep all of the appliances in a row along the kitchenâs back wall with an all-star line-up that includes aÂ <a href="https://www.ajmadison.com/cgi-bin/ajmadison/MAS304GASXE.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bertazzoni range</a>, a stainless steelÂ <a href="https://www.bosch-home.com/us/productslist/home-appliances/SHX65T55UC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch dishwasher</a>, and a slimÂ <a href="https://www.us-appliance.com/rf135bdlux1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisher &amp; Paykel fridge</a>Â with bottom freezer.Â The backsplash was an admitted splurge â Mario and Joe fell for anÂ <a href="https://www.annsacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Sacks tile</a>Â with an architectural feel and a subtle matte finish. From the living room it disappears, but in the kitchen, the raised detail is super gorgeous.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the apartment, Mario and Joe replaced dark parquet tiles with wide-plank, 7 1/2â matte-finished oak floors. They chose the starkest white wall color they could find to keep the main space modern (they actually choseÂ <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/redirects/paint-color-longurl?longUrl=linenwhite&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Mooreâs Linen White</a>,Â which has a very white feel in their place despite a name that suggests creamy undertones). The contractor updated baseboard molding with square trim, added low-rise built-in <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/living-room-storage-system-29882/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA cabinets</a> as a media center in the living room, stacked floating shelves in the master bedroom, and brought in extra help to overhaul the apartmentâs big closets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joeâs style sensibility works so well in the new layout. Somehow, they appear to have already owned most of the art and furniture pieces that look tailor-made in here. Mario explained that the trick was in figuring out where to place furniture and art after walls came down and left fewer surfaces for hanging pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A decor round-up is in order: the kitchen counter stools, couch, and coffee table are all from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>, the dining table is from <a href="https://www.cb2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CB2</a>, and the geometric red rug is a <a href="https://www.crateandbarrel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crate &amp; Barrel</a> pick. Sadly, the cowhide rug was a wanderlust find in Chile and the retro print hanging above the bed is from a DC market, so you canât have either, but there is a lot here that anyone could work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And in case you missed it, the couple also gutted their bathroom.

<p style="text-align: justify;">When a creative Clinton Hill coupleÂ came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> to find the right general contractor to renovate their aging co-op, we sent <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten Expert Kris</a> their way to create a new bath, alongside a new kitchen and hallway. Their original <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project post</a> called for a partial bathroom renovation, but for a couple who both work in graphic design and art, the temptation to work with a blank slateÂ led to a top-to-bottom upgrade.<span id="more-13209"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13219" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before.png" alt="SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SWEETEN-blackwhite-bathroom-02-before-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can&#8217;t tell from looking at the new sleek space, but the honest truth is that these homeowners poured all of their energy intoÂ designing and sourcing materials for their stunning <a href="https://sweeten.com/apartments/scandi-brooklyn-sweetened-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen and flooring renovation</a>. By theÂ time they got around to decision-making for the bathroom, they were determined not to over-design the space or spend more hours looking over tile choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Scandinavian design, they took a simple, clean, and functional approach in finding materials that would create a relaxing environment with no frills. White subway tiles anchored by dark slate floor tiles maximize brightness in the small space and amplify the extra square footage they carved out by doing away with the full-size bathtub. The new glass shower adds significant visual depth to the room, provides continuity for the tile&#8217;s subtle sheen, and gives a little gloss and polish to otherwise simple white and mirrored walls. Kris installed an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S79884333/#/S49023439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA sink cabinet</a> &#8211; a cost-saving piece with deep drawers that provides more storage than the old pedestal sink. Kris&#8217;s team also added a double-wide recessed medicine cabinet and re-located electrical outlets to make them more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Clinton Hill homeowner Diane moved into an apartment in a large, residential co-op on historic Clinton Avenue about a year and a half ago. Diane was no stranger to renovation and hoped to bring lessons learned from renovating a kitchen in a previous home to make the bathroom in her new home more functional and comfortable. The bathroom layout worked for Diane but the small space was in rough condition: large floor tiles covered the walls and were starting to loosen and crack. More importantly, Diane needed to adjust the height of most of the fixtures and add a few other touches around the room to customize the small space and make each element more comfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="full-bathroom-with-black-white-floor-tiles" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47969 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg" alt="small full bathroom with white wall tiles and pedastal sink with mirrored medicine cabinets and white and black floor tiles and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Diane-ClintonHillBathroom-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;My Sweeten contractors were so great &#8211; I could not have found a better contractor. Best experience I ever had.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Diane, Clinton Hill Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved Diane&#8217;s no-nonsense approach to this project. After a series ofÂ &#8220;nightmare&#8221; interactions with independentÂ contractors, and afterÂ two different contacts walked with Diane&#8217;s deposits, DianeÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>Â with all of her bases covered: she had already purchased new fixtures and navigated her building&#8217;s renovation approval process &#8211; two huge time-savers. We matched Diane withÂ <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Sean</a>Â who brought in rave reviews for responsiveness, staying in touch with project updates, and carefully protecting Diane&#8217;s home while work was underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To restore a bright, clean, and classic feel to the space, Diane turned to white subway tiles, an all-time Sweeten favorite for a crisp and easy-to-clean finish. As Sean&#8217;s team gutted the bath and cleared out layers of old tiles, Diane discovered<span id="more-11593"></span> an extra bonus; the work revealed two additional inches in the width and height of the room &#8211; a big win in a small bath!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Diane set out to find a taller sink and toilet, a cast iron tub for soaking, and a grab bar for the shower/tub. Diane selected a Toto sink and toilet; the toilet&#8217;s design conceals all of the pipe work and extends to the floor with a seamlessÂ surface that makes it extra easy to keep clean. The new sink provides a full six inches of counter surface area behind the Toto faucet, putting daily items well within reach. Diane looked far and wide for a tub with relatively petite dimensions and found a gorgeous Porcher tub that fit the bill. Sean&#8217;s team customized the tub installation with tile work and a bench.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With such a sleek and classic finish, it&#8217;s hard to picture the major showstopper that Sean&#8217;s team expertly handled in the middle of the project. Because Diane had done so much prep work with her co-op board and already had all of the materials on site, Sean was ready to knock out the work in less than two weeks. A few days in, Sean discovered that the building&#8217;s stack of galvanized steel pipes behind the bathroom wall was corroded and rotting. Sean and team jumped in to manage the unexpected issue with Diane and the building&#8217;s management and got the project back on track in three days.</p>
