										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Some of our favorite projects, big and small, in this booming neighborhood</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the Barclays Center on the north end and the farmer’s market at the Grand Army Plaza on the south end, Brooklyn&#8217;s Prospect Heights has something for everyone. From its historic architecture to its tree-lined streets, and with close proximity to Manhattan, it’s no wonder so many Sweeten renovators call it home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22777 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Joel_Apartment-08.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/galley-kitchen-and-sunken-living-room-get-a-holistic-re-desig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel and Eric’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joel and Eric already lived in the neighborhood (and loved it!), but ended up expanding their search for a larger apartment to include neighborhoods from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights and Brooklyn Heights. After a long search, they found what they were looking for&#8230;in the building next door. The one-bedroom, located in the heart of Prospect Heights, was brimming with potential. Its kitchen, with its dark cabinetry and metallic silver walls, was swapped for a more modern palette, including white, charcoal gray, and wood tone for added warmth. The pièce de résistance, a custom, wraparound counter that joins the kitchen to the living room, makes it easy to entertain.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20293 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Sarah_Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-new-kitchen-makes-way-for-two-new-arrivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Oleg’s apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The small galley kitchen in Sarah and Oleg’s one-bed, one-bath co-op had always bothered them. They knew they wanted to do something with it someday. Thinking of growing their family, “someday” became “right away,” and the couple turned to a full kitchen renovation that would also convert their dining area into a nursery. The space opened up, allowing the kitchen to become a U-shape, and bright white cabinets replaced the old, wood tone ones. And just in time for two new arrivals (twins!), the dining area was closed off as a separate bedroom with sliding doors. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28682 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1175" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-723x1175.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-185x300.jpg 185w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01-554x900.jpg 554w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_marissaBath_01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><br />
</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marissa’s bathroom</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa’s one-bed, one-bath co-op hadn’t been touched since the early &#8217;80s, and it showed. Persistent leaks, dropped ceilings, and builder-grade fixtures made the space feel neglected and unloved. Drawing inspiration from her six-year-long career as an off-Broadway lighting designer, Marissa planned a dramatic makeover for the space. Black paint paired with white subway tile provides contrast while a petite, crystal-adorned chandelier adds a touch of glam. The finished space is smart, sophisticated, and wildly popular on Sweeten&#8217;s social media.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28684 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-723x496.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-300x206.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01-600x412.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaija and John’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for a bigger home led Kaija and John to a one-bed, one-bath co-op in Prospect Heights. The priority was finding a sizable kitchen, one that could hold all of their appliances, including the ones that had been shipped and stored in Kaija’s parent’s basement in Minnesota. A gut renovation of their new kitchen was deemed necessary. The project centered on removing a half wall and creating a custom island with enough storage to stash an arsenal of kitchen gadgets. Inspired by the look of cement, the couple chose poured concrete for the island’s countertop. The addition of open shelves allowed them to put some of their larger appliances—like their attractive stand mixer—on display.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26525 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Amy_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="Prospect Heights renovations" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy and Nick’s kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First-time homeowners Amy and Nick wanted to buy in Brooklyn but didn’t want a space that needed a lot of work. That changed when they came across a two-bed, one-bath condo in Prospect Heights that had a layout that felt perfect for them. The first step was to free the kitchen from the triangular nook it was trapped in. Combining the kitchen and living room gave the kitchen plenty of room to grow. Aiming to create a space that would be ideal for both cooking and entertaining, a supersized kitchen island was installed and topped with Calacatta gold marble. Now the kitchen is the couple’s favorite spot to hang out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Glossy IKEA cabinets, parquet floors, and smart material swaps led the way in this Prospect Heights renovation.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">First-time homeowners Jill and Aaron landed a sunlit co-op (with parking!) in Prospect Heights. The downside seemed daunting: a faux-wood-and-laminate-counter combo in the 1960s kitchen and thick gray tile throughout the small bathroom. With no idea where to start and trepidation about finding a contractor online, Jill came to Sweeten to hire a team who could re-think their galley kitchen and gut the old bathroom. Read on for Jill’s take on their bright new space!</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/glossy-ikea-cabinets-shine-in-a-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19805" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg" alt="ikea cabinets" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jill-kitchen-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Jill in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></i><span id="more-19767"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We lived in a brownstone garden apartment in Prospect Heights for six years before seriously looking to buy. Over six months, we spent every weekend checking out open houses and coming to terms with what we could actually afford (Move-in ready two-bed/two-bath in Park Slope? Keep dreaming!) After getting outbid on two apartments, the third time really was the charm. We were officially in contract for a one-bedroom in a doorman co-op building three blocks away from Prospect Park (and our current apartment). It had a space we could convert into a den, extra closet room, tons of natural light, and every New Yorker’s dream: parking! The only downside was that it hadn’t been updated since the ‘60s and needed a complete overhaul. Now what?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19737 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_jill_kitchen_bathroom-before-02" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Jill_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of our friends had done renovations so we didn’t have any recommendations to go on for a contractor. We reached out to a few random ones we found online, but we hadn’t seen any of their work and didn’t feel like we could really trust them. I was so nervous someone was going to take advantage of us since we hadn’t done this before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when a friend told us about </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we decided to </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post our project</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had never owned an apartment before, let alone renovated one, and we needed all the help we could get. After a quick budget check (the Sweeten team helped us realize we were completely unrealistic in how much the renovation would cost), we were matched up with </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Kris</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We loved that he had done work in our neighborhood, and it seemed to match our modern style. Plus all of his reviews said he finished his work on time, and since we would be paying rent on top of a mortgage until we could move in, that was music to our ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we met with Kris, he really listened to what we wanted to do and was quick to point out if something wouldn’t be possible. After walking the space with him, we agreed on a game plan: close off the wall between the galley kitchen and the dining room, open up the wall between the kitchen and living room, make a sliding door for the bathroom to maximize the space, extend the parquet floors into the kitchen and closets, and gut everything else! Almost as soon as we closed, his team was on-site and starting demo work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since we knew this wasn’t our forever home, we tried to stick to a budget and not go too overboard. Kris helped us make all our decisions with the bottom-line and timeline in mind. New hardwood flooring would have been nice but the parquet flooring could just be refinished. Custom cabinets would have been gorgeous in the small kitchen, but the glossy IKEA cabinets we chose would still look great.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would have loved marble flooring in the bathroom, but ceramic tile wouldn’t need any maintenance. There were definitely areas where we splurged though: For one, Aaron got his wish for higher-end appliances and quartz countertops. My must-haves included an Italian glass backsplash and a new soaking tub.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky our rental was close by, so we could stop in anytime and check on the progress. Kris was always there to meet us and show us how things were going and checked with us even if minor changes had been made. There were so many times we questioned whether we had made mistakes, but keeping in close contact with Kris and having him walk us through the progress really gave us hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Kris was true to his word. We were able to move in after just six weeks and stay on budget. Now, when we hear some of our friends’ stories about their contractors and what a nightmare renovating was for them, we feel very fortunate and even talk about taking on a renovation again!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="white-dining-table-black-chairs" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48490 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18.jpg" alt="White dining table with black chairs and happy couple with dog after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Joel-Apt-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work, business school, and an appetite for adventure had Joel and Eric relocating from NYC to overseas and back again. With New York soil permanently underfoot, the couple set their sights on a spacious one-bedroom co-op with loads of potential in the heart of Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights area. Ready to undo a decade-old renovation of glitter paint and overly dark finishes, this couple teamed up with a Sweeten general contractor and his past Sweeten clients, designers <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casey and Kumar</a>, to get it done.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Joel, Prospect Heights homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, work opportunities and the promise of adventure led my partner, Eric, and I to leave NYC. We lived abroad, I went to business school, and we even found ourselves settling in Downtown Detroit for a while. But in early 2015, moving prompted us yet again; this time unexpectedly back to where our journey began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, it was smart that we kept the small studio apartment that Eric owned when we left. It made the logistics of moving back to the city easy to stomach. To save money, we set a goal of living in the studio for as long as possible. “How bad could it be?” we thought: the studio is in an awesome location with great subway access, and is surrounded by dog-friendly parks. This was wishful thinking. 400 square feet turned out to be far too small for two men and a precocious American Eskimo Dog named Comet.</span></p>
<h3>Finding a new home in Prospect Heights</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We embarked on a hunt for more spacious digs with some basic criteria: a well-proportioned, reasonably priced (by NYC standards), pet-friendly 1BR/1BA apartment with dog-friendly parks nearby. After a four-month search, we finally closed on a large, corner apartment in a welcoming co-op. We had spent summer and fall weekends attending open houses from Hamilton Heights to Jackson Heights to Brooklyn Heights – only to end up in the building right next door to where we were already living – in Prospect Heights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features in the new apartment that struck us during our first open house visit: plentiful sunlight streaming in from multiple large windows on three sides, ample storage space, an in-unit washer and dryer, and rooms with generous proportions. The apartment is located in a 1920’s-era co-op building on a stretch of Eastern Parkway where many units contain sunken living rooms, high ceilings, and elaborate ornamental details. But sometime in the early 2000s, our apartment suffered a poorly executed renovation that installed heavy, dark cabinetry throughout, dark flooring and dark paint colors. One of the strangest choices: kitchen walls painted metallic silver in which actual glitter had been included. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from these superficial issues, there were also some fundamental flaws in the floor plan that we wanted to change. An awkward entry foyer &#8211; too small to fit a full-size dining table but too large to be a hallway &#8211; adjoined an enclosed, undersized kitchen. Similarly, a short, dark hallway led to a cramped bathroom that lacked sufficient storage and counter space. The bathroom always smelled damp and musty because the floor and walls were finished with absorbent limestone tiles.</span></p>
<h3>Finding the right experts for the job</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the weekends we spent open-house hopping, Eric and I met a woman selling her charmingly renovated Crown Heights apartment who raved about Sweeten. Months later, after closing, we recalled this conversation and </span><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the vision for our renovation on Sweeten</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We eventually connected with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a></strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eric and I were impressed by the portfolio of work that Kris had executed for other clients, especially his focus on simple finishes and quality craftsmanship. Eric and I contacted references; one of the references was a designer named Kumar. He and his wife Casey, also a designer, had just moved into their apartment and had <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated with Sweeten and the same contractor</a>. Kumar invited us to visit. When Eric and I arrived at Casey and Kumar’s apartment, we were stunned by their beautiful, comfortable, modernist apartment renovation that was full of thoughtful construction details.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Eric and I fancy ourselves as design-minded, we didn’t have the ability to design or manage a renovation that would approach Casey and Kumar’s beautiful home. Kumar must have intuited this because he suggested that we could hire Casey, who was already planning to launch a freelance design career, to serve as our project designer and manager. We loved this proposal and signed up as their inaugural client. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The design process was holistic and thorough. They started our first meetings asking us how we lived our lives at home, the kinds of physical objects and furniture we have (or would like to have), and how we wanted to use the new space. Knowing that Eric and I wanted a calm and minimalist aesthetic with some warmth, Casey composed a palette of colors in shades of white, grey and blue and materials consisting of stones and wood grain to employ throughout the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the kitchen, Kumar strongly advised that since we had a well-proportioned apartment, converting the kitchen to an open concept with the living room wasn’t desirable. With our contractor&#8217;s help, we discovered that multiple gas and water pipes in the wall between the kitchen and living room made this idea impractical. He determined it was feasible to enlarge the kitchen by removing the wall separating it from the foyer. With a larger kitchen, we gained an opportunity to extend the countertop and increase the workspace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to somehow create a relationship between the kitchen and living room, Casey came up with the brilliant idea of installing a unified countertop, designed as a monumental piece of furniture, that wraps around the wall between the two rooms with plenty of integrated storage underneath. On the kitchen side, this counter would serve as the kitchen prep workspace. On the living room side, the countertop could function as a buffet surface adjacent to where we planned to place a dining table. At the peninsula end where the two sides meet, a beautiful waterfall edge would function as a service and conversational area for drinks or appetizers during dinner parties.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the countertop material, Eric and I wanted marble but decided against it due to cost, softness, and tendency to absorb stains. Our contractor recommended we use durable Caesarstone and we went with the “Raw Concrete” finish. Working with his carpenter, Casey and Kumar designed custom white oak kitchen cabinets to mirror the new lighter wood flooring that replaced the black mosaic floor tiles. We stripped the existing floors elsewhere in the apartment and refinished them with a much lighter stain to match the new kitchen floor. The two items we kept from the original kitchen were the Bosch stove and dishwasher left by the previous owners. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely gutted the bathroom and indeed enlarged it by incorporating part of the adjacent hallway. The washer/dryer closet door used to open into this narrow hallway that would now be part of the bathroom. We reversed the orientation of the washer/dryer closet so it opened instead to the more spacious bedroom. Casey designed a glass enclosed shower stall to replace the tub. The floating Duravit Scola sink and streamlined Toto toilet were chosen for their minimal footprints, helping to increase the sense of openness in the small space. We utilized a minimalist material palette for the bathroom: honed slate tile floors and white subway tiles for the walls, with a floating white oak shelf above the sink for a touch of warmth. The Toto toilet washlet was an indulgence we wanted to include from our experience abroad.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen and the bathroom were the biggest design and construction interventions in our project. But throughout the apartment, our designers were adamant that we address numerous small and simple details that Eric and I never would have thought of on our own. A few examples: In the entry hallway there was already a large coat closet. Casey and Kumar convinced us to create a new pantry out of some of the former foyer space. Not only did we get additional food storage, but the outer wall of the new pantry now lined up with the refrigerator wall of the kitchen, helping to reinforce the visual identity of our newly enlarged kitchen space. At the entry to the sunken living room, the team recommended removing the wrought iron rails and squaring off the formerly rounded stair landing. And inside the shortened hall between the bedroom and bathroom that used to be a shadow cove, the decorative arch was removed and the ceiling lowered to be flush with the lower ceiling level of the adjacent sunken living room. These and other small changes clarified what used to be many intersecting and conflicting lines and helped the overall design feel cohesive. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design scheme for our apartment was far more thoughtful and sophisticated than Eric and I expected. But the quality of the end result would not have been possible without the customer commitment and attention to quality from our contractor. From the very beginning, we felt confident that we were putting our investment in safe and competent hands. In any construction project, you expect a certain amount of unforeseen problems and ours was no exception. One significant example towards the end of the project: the stone subcontractor installed the three massive pieces of the Caesarstone countertop. After the installation cured, it looked beautiful, but the pieces were not sized perfectly. To an untrained eye, the difference wasn’t immediately noticeable, but Casey noticed the problem and brought it to our attention. Our Sweeten contractor immediately took ownership of the error. A week or so later, the stone fabricators returned and put in new pieces. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be happier with the end result of our apartment renovation. It’s an amazing feeling to come off the busy streets of New York City and enter our new home that is beautiful, serene, and supremely comfortable, and have space to entertain or host guests. We got to this result through the work of a couple of talented young designers and a builder we were incredibly happy to work with. Sweeten made this all possible. A happy customer told us about Sweeten. Sweeten helped us find an excellent contractor. And through good word-of-mouth from the contractor’s previous client, we unexpectedly also ended up hiring that client as our project designer and manager. As very satisfied customers, Eric and I are happy to continue that virtuous cycle.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen in Kaija and John’s one-bedroom, one-bathroom Brooklyn co-op began life as a slim galley until the day came when the previous owner chopped the galley’s wall to half-height and slapped some formica on top—opening up the kitchen to the living room and creating a little faux island. I’m not sure we’ve seen this move before…sneaky! When Kaija and John bought the place, they knew they needed to put some work in, and that little wannabe island seemed like an inviting place to start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/before-after-kaija-and-johns-prospect-heights-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15099 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/johnkitchen.png" alt="prospect heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/johnkitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/johnkitchen-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the layout of the kitchen admittedly worked pretty well, John, a senior digital media producer, and Kaija, who works in production for an art book publisher, surveyed the existing storage, counter prep, and gathering space and realized that a real island would have a major impact on all three of those needs<span id="more-15109"></span>. Many of their kitchen appliances were stuck in Minnesota, stowed in Kaija’s parents’ basement after their wedding yielded more treasures than their previous NYC apartment could hold. A stand mixer, food processor and collection of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XC1SAC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004XC1SAC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=VUKSHARCSDDSB6RE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Clad</a> pots and pans sat in boxes, waiting to make it big in New York. John and Kaija <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and we introduced them to a Sweeten contractor for a full kitchen renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15101" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-Before-01-03.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-Before-01-03" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-Before-01-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-Before-01-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Armed with a list of web sites and local suppliers provided by their contractor, Kaija and John went about crafting an entirely new kitchen around a significantly expanded island. The contractor custom-built a hefty island with rows of deep drawers, using durable plywood interiors and doors finished in matte white. He also created several lines of custom open shelving to flank the window (and that mixer in Minnesota bought a first class ticket to New York!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old white floor tiles were ripped out and replaced with Alta ceramic tiles in slate gray from <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a>, chosen for their durability. Classic white subway tile, also from Nemo, was added to the kitchen’s main wall and extended up and around, all the way through to the windowed wall, demarcating the kitchen in a new way and giving it a distinct feel in the open plan room. John and Kaija chose gray grout for a touch of contrast and to complement the neutral gray flooring.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">John and Kaija originally thought about going with a honed marble countertop but were warned left and right that if anything acidic spilled, it would eat right into the luxe surface. They shifted the plan toward soapstone, a Sweeten fave, but it was pricey and didn&#8217;t feel like quite the right choice. Originally inspired by the look and feel of cement, they went back to the drawing board and decided to go with poured concrete counters; equal parts industrial and softening. The creation process was local but a bit lengthy: their supplier sent a team for precise on-site measurements after the cabinets went in. Those measurements led to a full-size frame assembled off-site and the mold was poured at the supplier’s workshop. Several rounds of curing, slurrying, smoothing, grinding, and finishing took a few weeks before final installation in the new kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15105 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="prospect heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen-04-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">John and Kaija chose heavy duty appliances and fixtures alongside their new custom cabinets and counters, including a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005AEP2PE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005AEP2PE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=XFVIV24CGF2J64QF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> porcelain farmhouse sink, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009VXX7KC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B009VXX7KC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=PDSFJUF7ZE3BAQNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a> stove, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CV8SWG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003CV8SWG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=CNDL4Y7TOBDTHT3P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liebherr</a> fridge, 18” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057WCGJ4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0057WCGJ4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=JDPMPMRQ2Y4IU657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bosch</a> dishwasher, and sleek <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073B3Y6G/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0073B3Y6G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sweeten09-20&amp;linkId=OLHMLKTVY6ZJFKKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faber</a> hood.

<p style="text-align: justify;">When it&#8217;s summertime in NYC, there&#8217;s nothing more coveted than having your own outdoor space &#8212; but along with the many perks, comes the obligation to keep it well-maintained throughout the year. Just keeping up with the seasonal cycles of potting, planting, and maintenance alone can keep any invested DIYer on their toes, especially during the warmer seasons. So, what if you want to give your landscape a more drastic overhaul? For one Prospect Heights family who enjoys gardening and relaxing in their outdoor space, taking their private yard to the next level required the help of a talented young firm. This week, we&#8217;re excited to introduce the newest member, boutique design &amp; general contracting firm, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Davis Thompson</a>, who helped this Brooklyn family transform their outdoor space and create a backyard playhouse for all ages. Palmer Thompson-Moss, principal &amp; owner of GDT, gave us the scoop on the design and construction of the completed project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/000_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9252" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/000_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg" alt="000_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/000_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/000_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When working on design + build projects, such as this backyard retreat, Palmer collaborates with project designer Isobel Herbold (Palmer &amp; Isobel photographed above). GDT&#8217;s great respect for the environment, meticulous craftsmanship, and imaginative design spirit, made Palmer&#8217;s team perfect for tackling this garden build-out.<span id="more-9162"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9164" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png" alt="02_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="341" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/02_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>The project scope included enclosing the 1400 sqft yard with a new perimeter fence, as well as creating an &#8216;anchor&#8217; for all backyard activities &#8212; a screened-in space for eating, playing, relaxing, and entertaining. Throughout the design process, GDT created drawings, collages, &amp; models, which helped to convey their design ideas to the homeowners. Above is a playful collage they put together in an early iteration of the proposed design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-copy-copy.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9238" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-copy-copy.jpg" alt="03_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse copy copy" width="600" height="414" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-copy-copy.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-copy-copy-300x207.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Palmer &amp; Isobel, models, like the one above, are particularly useful in face-to-face meetings with clients; they make it easy for the homeowner to respond to the designers&#8217; ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9166" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/04_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a brief design phase, Palmer lead his team to construction on the 6-week project. Here, in the first week of construction, they&#8217;ve started with the perimeter fence and have also begun anchoring posts that will support the screened enclosure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9167" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png" alt="05_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/05_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completed fence &amp; enclosure feature cedar and copper as the primary materials. Palmer told us, &#8220;we chose to use natural materials that could be sourced locally and would age nicely over time.&#8221; Looking toward the back of the yard, the &#8216;playhouse&#8217; structure is nearly hidden through the homeowners&#8217; romantic garden landscape, which adds to its very serene, retreat-like quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/06_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9168" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/06_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg" alt="06_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/06_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/06_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the exterior of the wood-frame structure, GDT added antique lamps that were salvaged from a WWII navy vessel &#8212; the 70-year-old, solid brass fixtures were retrofitted with modern wiring to be used here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/07_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9169" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/07_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png" alt="07_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/07_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/07_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside the structure, we can appreciate the opportunity to feel surrounded by nature, despite the reality of the city right outside. For GDT, the choice to use natural &amp; sustainable materials is a common thread in their work; the designers embrace the materials&#8217; natural beauty and proneness to change over time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We wanted to create a space to dwell in the yard, to be playful and contemplative, to be able to be outside and inside at the same time.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/08_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/08_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png" alt="08_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/08_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/08_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the surprise of these clever, super functional built-ins &#8212; a sandbox and drink cooler are closed off with decking material when not in use, then uncovered for summer fun. For a direct route from the main house to the playhouse, the designers created a pathway using another local material, New York Bluestone pavers that were salvaged from the neighborhood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9171" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg" alt="09_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09_theSweeten_GrantDavisThompson-playhouse-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GDT&#8217;s goal was to create a space that improved the quality of life in the yard and that could be enjoyed by all ages &#8212; we&#8217;re convinced they succeeded in just that!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Palmer for sharing this beautiful project by GDT!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have a safe &amp; fun 4th of July!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we were invited to tour the beautiful new Prospect Heights eatery, <a href="https://elbertarestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elberta</a>, designed by Anishka and Niya of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ishka Designs</a>. We were excited to learn more about another great business in Brooklyn after our recent small biz story slam night. We&#8217;re also thrilled to see an increasing number of small business owners posting their projects on our main site&#8230;a <a href="https://sweeten.com/projects/Other-Interior-Room/Bring-the-Vibe-restaurant-West-Village-New-York-NY-looking-for-estimates/601#details">restaurant</a>, an office and a shuffleboard court! For this project, the designers worked alongside the business owners to give a sophisticated makeover to the former Velvet Peach Cafe. Now the space, the mood, and the menu are all distinctly a part of the conceptual character of Elberta.</p>

The designers sourced the fixtures on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SouthernLightsTN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">etsy</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4155" style="width: 570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4155" class="size-full wp-image-4155 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/08_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-4155" class="wp-caption-text">Near the back of the space, gold &amp; white wallpaper in a floral motif adds a touch of femininity. From this view we can get a sense of how the designers worked in layers of texture &amp; contrasting colors to create Elberta&#8217;s mood. The brick wall was painted to match the white of the wallpaper using Mountain Peak White from the Natura line by Benjamin Moore.</p></div>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-4156 mb-24" title="Elbert Restaurant - Ishka Designs" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/09_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_elberta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>One of the most important features and the inevitable centerpiece of the bar/restaurant was the bar top itself. The designers selected a sustainable surface by <a href="https://torzosurfaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TorZo</a>, made from sorghum stalks. And for the bar face, glass panels were mounted over a white surface.</p>
