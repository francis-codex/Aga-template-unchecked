										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Elegant ways to use an apartment radiator cover to hide design eyesores</h2>
<p>Sometimes the little details of renovations fall by the wayside because there are so many design and construction decisions to make. That&#8217;s why it’s important to recognize seemingly minor updates that can have a big impact. For example, think about an apartment radiator cover. They’re not a building requirement, and they don&#8217;t influence a radiator&#8217;s efficiency. Still, this nice-to-have detail can instantly make any space look more polished and provide additional storage too.</p>
<p>Here are some ways <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners upped their radiator game. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>1. Sleek and modern</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of this Park Slope, Brooklyn renovation was <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the kitchen</a>. However, the Sweeten general contractor helped complete a few other projects in the apartment, including a handsome radiator cover in the bedroom. “My growing puppy decided the cover was her favorite place to sit and watch squirrels,” the homeowner shared. “My general contractor came back to install reinforcements so it could handle the weight of a full-grown dog.”</p>

<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37912 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg" alt="These apartment radiator covers blend in seamlessly with the white, modern room design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Michelle-Burg-Apt-10-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>2. Bookshelf camouflage</h3>
<p>Lauren’s renovation involved updating her apartment&#8217;s layout so the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen and living areas were open and cohesive</a>. She focused on built-in storage in the kitchen and wanted to bring the same element to her living space. “A sleek bookshelf hides my radiator and air conditioner units that were always annoyingly off-centered from the windows,” she said. Plus, the radiator cover is perfect for displaying plants and knick-knacks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31170 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg" alt="This homeowner used a bookshelf to strategically hide her two apartment radiators" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen17-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>3. Repurposed design elements</h3>
<p>Architects Terri and Brett<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/when-pros-design-their-family-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gutted their Prospect Heights co-op</a> to make it feel more bright and spacious. Every detail was a result of their collaboration, including radiator covers in the living area and bedroom. A millworker made the radiators easier to access for maintenances purposes. Plus, the new covers&#8217; tops were made from leftover stone slabs from the kitchen. This helped create a cohesive design throughout the whole house.</p>

<h3>4. Custom carpentry</h3>
<p>While Charon’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/gramercy-park-bathroom-renovation-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> gorgeous green bathroom renovation</a> was in progress, her Sweeten general contractor’s carpentry team took care of other apartment details. They built a custom bedroom radiator cover to match one she already had in the living area. The new cover joined the design elements of her home and put the finishing touch on her already pretty sleep space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="gray-bedroom-double-bed" class="alignnone wp-image-37915 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg" alt="gray bedroom with double bed and side table and window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37914 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1.jpg" alt="The radiator becomes less of an eye sore and blends in with the rest of the room's design" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Charon-Dyer-Bathroom-07-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>4. Added storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining two apartments is no easy job</a>. Luckily, Zoe and Arvid easily overcame that challenge. Plus, they made sure to still take notice of small (and important) details in their new home. The air conditioning unit and radiator in their living had 50 years of layered paint. Not to mention, it took up valuable space. With their general contractor&#8217;s help, they designed an apartment radiator cover that made the appliance less obtrusive and added shelves for extra storage.</p>
