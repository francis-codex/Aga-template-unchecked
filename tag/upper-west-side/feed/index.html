<li><strong>Primary renovation: </strong>A gut remodel of a kitchen requiring major electrical work and a suite of compact appliances</li>
<li><strong>With: </strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5435#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote: </strong>&#8220;F<span class="s1">rom the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that’s one reason why it went so smoothly.&#8221;</span></li>

<h3>Technical needs take priority over aesthetics</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I knew from the beginning that the electrical work needed to be upgraded, and I included that important aspect of the job when I posted my project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>. </span><span class="s4">I took part in the initial consultations with contractors via Zoom, and then met the ones that interested me in person. My Sweeten contractor, who I chose to hire, is a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned contracting firm</a>. She came with the electrician and gave me a better estimate</span><span class="s1">. </span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The plan was to </span><span class="s2">replace the electrical box and redistribute the power, since I’d been having constant issues when I used multiple appliances simultaneously. We would also </span><span class="s1">improve the lighting by installing new fixtures and switches.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">A plumber assessed that the old pipes and a plumbing line</span><span class="s1"> would need to be replaced before putting in a new sink and faucet. Those fixes would be particularly essential since I wanted to install a dishwasher for the first time.</span></p>

<h4>A 180-degree kitchen remodel</h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Of course, I felt most excited about the things that were visible. I hoped to find a source for small, good-quality small-sized appliances. I wanted to use Ikea cabinets and replace the countertops and backsplash. We would redo the kitchen top to bottom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from refinishing the walls</a> and soffits to putting down a new floor.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This was not my first renovation, but my first time doing a major teardown and remodel. I had a lot of questions about the cabinets and having enough storage space, in addition to the technical updates. My Sweeten contractor helped so much during the planning phase. I asked a lot of questions before we started. She provided great suggestions.</span></p>
<h3>Spotlight on compact appliances for small spaces</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The renovation was straightforward: No walls were moved and no layout changes were made. </span><span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50276 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with brass fixtures and open shelving" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With this in mind, my biggest choices were the appliances and the cabinets. It was a challenge finding reasonably priced and attractive compact appliances—when you’re looking for 18-, 20- or 24-inch models, choices are limited. I found the dishwasher, but t</span><span class="s4">he hood took a long time. I didn&#8217;t want one that stuck out, and anything less than 24 inches seemed nonexistent. When I found this 20-inch model, I ordered it right away—but then it came and we had no idea how to make it ductless! Note to apartment dwellers: A ductless hood, or one that can be adapted with a kit, is what you need. </span><span class="s1">By the time I found these items, I’d <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to go with custom cabinets</a>, to make life easier and maximize space.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">I had an initial design in mind but because of the extra money I spent on electrical and plumbing upgrades, I had to change it and cut materials</span><span class="s2"> costs.</span>
</p></blockquote>
<h4>A unique blend of color and pattern</h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, with custom cabinets, I had an opportunity to be creative with color.</span> <span class="s6">Initially, I’d envisioned light-gray cabinets with wood flooring. Then I changed my mind and</span><span class="s1"> looked at patterned vinyl flooring; in the end, I decided to </span><span class="s6">totally</span><span class="s1"> contrast it to the wood floor in the living area</span><span class="s6">. Looking at it with paint chips, a paint color called Brittany Blue—a light gray-blue with a warm-gray undertone—looked best for the cabinets.</span><span class="s1"> The color wasn’t far from what I had imagined, and it was a really good decision.</span> <span class="s1">I wanted a gold tone as an accent color, so I chose brass handles for the doors and drawers.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">When it came to the island, I got even bolder. I purchased it online and when it came, I didn&#8217;t like the color, so I decided to experiment. I’d seen a photo of a kitchen that had purple cabinets. I remembered it because that color choice was so unusual and didn&#8217;t look dated. Painting that island was a fun project.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I chose quartz for the countertops and wanted to continue with the same material for the backsplash. For a small kitchen, it made a lot of sense, especially in terms of budget, since it didn’t cost anything extra to install.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50281 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with eat-in nook" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50277 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated kitchen with quartz countertop and microwave storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jena-Kitchen-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">For the lighting, I was less involved than I expected to be. </span><span class="s1">I wanted overall lighting and also a fixture above the dining table. My contractor and electrician suggested installing LED lights above the cabinets, which turned out to be my favorite aspect of the renovation. The lights are dimmable, and such an upgrade from just a single ceiling fixture.</span></p>
<h3>Good communication—the key to a successful remodel</h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Throughout the process, I was so happy to have my Sweeten contractor’s input.</span><span class="s1"> When something on my list cost too much, she always came up with an alternative solution that worked just as well. Also, from the start of the job to completion, we communicated constantly, and I think that’s one reason why it went so smoothly.</span> <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten also stayed in touch</a> and helped with project flow by checking in periodically. There weren’t any issues, but I liked knowing I had a fallback in case something went wrong. I think I worried less throughout the renovation as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The project worked out so well that it’s hard to list just one thing I love about it. I am truly pleased with the new kitchen’s flow, and the look of the whole room tops even what I had hoped it could be. I am really happy with the result.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah, a lawyer in the finance industry, bought her prewar one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. She spent several years living in the apartment before embarking on a kitchen renovation. She also redid the floors. “The decisions I made after really living in the space were just better—how I moved in and out of the kitchen, how the rooms communicated with each other,” she said.</p>

<h3>Reaching out for help</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovation projects became exhausting, so she took a break—even though the bathroom was disjointed from the rest of the apartment, with its beige tones and frumpy &#8217;70s aesthetic. It also had a dropped ceiling for seemingly no reason, which cramped the small space. “I backed away because it seemed like too much to take on,” she said, but she finally took the plunge and posted her NYC prewar bathroom remodel on Sweeten to find a general contractor.</p>
<h5><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="glass enclosed tub" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31836" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-03-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h5>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Raising up a dropped ceiling</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah envisioned something that was reflective of her co-op building’s beautiful foyer with its marble and clean look. “I think my design was to let the space speak for itself,” she said. The Sweeten contractors she hired set out to raise the ceiling. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what we were going to find,&#8221; Leah said. Because they could not find any pipes or any other obvious reason for the dropped ceiling, they were able to raise it again.</p>
<p>She selected classic subway tiles for the walls and a marble top for the vanity. With the floors, the Sweeten contractors made a reassuring discovery—the original tiles were still underneath, and matched the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new creamy hexagon tiles</a> Leah had chosen. It was a confirmation that her design choices were in line with how the bathroom was originally meant to be.</p>

<h3>Adding warmth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While Leah had planned for white and silver tones, she made a last-minute decision to bring in gold fixtures. “I wanted to add warmth,” she said of the 11th-hour choice. Luckily, she found the renovation process to be far less taxing than she had anticipated. She was in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily communication</a> with her Sweeten contractors, who helped solve problems and helped her make those nuts-and-bolts decisions, like how far up the wall the tiles should go. “It was a very collaborative process,” she said.</p>

<h3>Saving for a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leah decided early on where she would save money (like tile choices) <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with her remodeling budget</a> and where she would spend more lavishly. Because of the small space, she decided on a custom bathtub, which took six weeks to make in South Carolina. “Every bathtub that was standard was made for bigger spaces,” she said. “I needed something that fit my dimensions.” The shower enclosure and tub combination became a show stopping centerpiece of the bathroom and were well worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="bathroom reno" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31832" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LeahCampbell-Bathroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3>Moving back to the city</h3>
<p>We relocated back to Manhattan several years ago after residing in the Midwest and South for work. It was simply time to return home to our families in the Tri-State area. Bob and I met in NYC while studying for our MBAs, and Bob grew up here. While away, we owned several single-family homes—a few we had renovated—so we weren’t strangers to the process. There was a high likelihood of renovating to make a space our own as <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we started the buying phase</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44562" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg" alt="NYC renovation portrait" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Portrait-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>We rented for a few years until we located an apartment on the Upper West Side that would satisfy our love of prewar architectural details while accommodating modern living. Our home was purchased through an estate sale and we immediately started renovating. It had been updated in the early ‘90s, when the owners created an open floor plan of living room, dining room, and foyer which was a big draw for us. And there are two windows in every room except the bath, so the light was a huge selling point.</p>
<div></div>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mapping the &#8220;musts&#8221; for an empty nest renovation</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Bob rents office space, I required a fully functional home office in a dedicated space. Also, a washer/dryer. We lived without them for a few years in Manhattan after having a laundry room in suburban homes, and we didn’t want to do that ever again. Both the kitchen and the bath needed better functionality and major cosmetic updates. Storage was essential throughout the apartment, as well as better lighting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our vision for the apartment was classic and period-appropriate but updated for today. We felt it was important to keep within the prewar aesthetic, including subway tiles, wood flooring, wide baseboard and door frame moldings, classic single-panel doors, radiator covers, and shaker-style cabinets.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44566 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Second-Bedroom-19.gif" alt="closet turn home office" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<h3>More storage and a tip for staying cool</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary bedroom initially had a large double-door closet. We flipped it to be used in the second bedroom next door as a home office. We created built-in drawers and cabinets, as well as added new closets to account for the one given to the home office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved ditching the tub for a large shower stall and completely rearranging the primary bath. We went for a custom industrial-style shower screen, mosaic floor tiles, and classic subway tiles with a twist: a crackle pattern. Plus a black metal grate for heat. The design worked.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in selecting and getting product delivered in time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrical rewiring was not expected, but it had to be done. Then we replaced all the lighting and added ceiling fans in the bedrooms and kitchen. It’s a trick from the south because you can cut down on A/C bills. And it’s a plus in a prewar building where you can’t regulate the heat in winter.  We went for sleek, custom radiator covers that are great for display on top, too.</span></p>
<p>In the foyer, we extended the closet out by six inches and added shelving on top. So what was non-functional became completely utilized, with tons of space. We added bookshelves in the living room—we love books and are avid readers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44554 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="stainless steel kitchen counter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Enlisting Sweeten during a hurdle</h3>
<p>Bob would say the stainless steel countertops surrounding the range are a throwback to a &#8217;50s kitchen we had. Those tops are indestructible! It was the only design element he wished to have a “say” in. Bob is the expert in paint colors. I can give him a palette of 10 colors and he can narrow them down so that they flow together from room to room.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While we had renovation knowledge, every experience has its unexpected nuances. We were very relieved to have <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten as the backstop</a> when needed. It was great to have someone who could assist in holding the contractors accountable. </span><span class="s1">We had problems with the contractor with a leak after moving in. So parts of the kitchen had to be dismantled, the leak fixed, and put back together again. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> stood by us and made sure the job was completed correctly. </span></p>
<div></div>
<h3>When planning for the unexpected pays off</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wish I had engaged Sweeten to talk through the contract, which might have avoided several issues. Having a second set of eyes is never a bad idea! For example, while I was very specific on the type of cabinetry I wanted, we found the budget in the contract did not align with reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help alleviate the overage, I hit the sales.  Also, I sourced what I needed at the onset so we weren&#8217;t crunched for time in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selecting and getting product delivered in time</a>. Additionally, we had allocated extra funds for overages and the unexpected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our new home makes us feel joyful. Our daughter commented that the space is aesthetically a culmination of all of our past homes, with a bit of industrial thrown in. It’s truly who we are at this stage of life, a mix of the past and present: kids grown, empty nesters with a puppy in the house!</span></p>

<h3>A full gut renovation</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When we purchased our apartment, we knew that we were going to renovate it.  As someone who loves design, I saw the potential and welcomed the opportunity to take a space and figure out how to best make it work for our family of five including three boys (and two dogs). I did not, however, anticipate we would be undertaking a full gut renovation—and while we had renovated before, those projects were a much smaller scope.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44273" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg" alt="hiding tv idea" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-livingroom-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Working with an architect</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we closed on our apartment, we began working with our <a href="https://www.jwarchitecturedpc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect Jessica Wetters</a> on how to change the layout of the apartment. The plan was to open it up and improve the light and flow. The living spaces would be connected as well as add a bedroom and a half-bathroom. It was clear to our architect that the apartment required a full-gut renovation and that little could be saved. After a few rounds of revising the plans, we arrived at a layout that achieved our objectives.  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg" alt="hallway" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44266" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-hallway-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg" alt="master bedroom" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44277" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-master-bedroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Finding the right contractor</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Before we found Sweeten, we began working with a contractor on the budget for the project and costs kept going up. We were at the point where we were cutting parts of the project that were important to us (like millwork) and making compromises we weren’t comfortable with in order to stay within budget. I decided to post our project on Sweeten. It would allow me to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add more cost estimates into the mix</a> with their network of general contractors and see if I had unrealistic expectations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44264" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-4-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Sweeten matched us with three contractors, but after <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing this general contractor</a>, I knew he was the one for our project. Not only did he assure us that he could get us everything we wanted within our budget, but he promised that he would minimize the disruption to our lives and work with our aggressive timeline.   </span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg" alt="Henrybuilt kitchen" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44267" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-kitchen-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As soon as we hired him, things moved quickly and once we had all of the necessary approvals, we moved into a rental apartment. Demolition began</span><span class="s2"> in February and work was completed over the summer. </span></p>

<h3>Functional and modern</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first decision we made was the kitchen. I knew I wanted a Henrybuilt kitchen. I love the functionality and feel of our kitchen. We also planned for a black wall in the living room using huge porcelain tile slabs to camouflage our TV and it turned out even better than I expected. I researched industrial factory doors to connect the living room and bedrooms, but it was over-budget (even the reclaimed factory doors I saw were $7,000+) so I had a door made with a similar look for a small fraction of the cost.</span></p>

<h3>Replacing the floors</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition to opening up the kitchen, foyer, and living room, we enlarged the size of our master bathroom and added closets in unused space in the master bedroom. Throughout the apartment, we replaced the hardwood floors, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coated the walls</a>, replaced the trim, replaced all of the lighting, and added millwork.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When I told our Sweeten contractor that our rental ended in June and that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that—despite his strong recommendation that we hold off moving in. Even though we lived there without a kitchen which wasn’t optimal—his crew set up a refrigerator in the middle of the apartment—there was no question that it would be worth it in the end. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg" alt="vertical shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44260" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-bathroom-16-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p4">The perfect finished product</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When a couple of unexpected structural issues were discovered during demo that required changes to the layout, our contractor immediately contacted our architect and me and proposed solutions that ended up improving the project. Issues that could have induced panic and delays were addressed efficiently and proactively. Our contractor, our architect, and I met at the apartment nearly every week to discuss progress and make decisions to ensure that the project kept moving forward on schedule. </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We are thrilled with the results. We achieved exactly the look and feel we were going for and I firmly believe that the process went as smoothly and efficiently as it did, thanks to our contractor, his crew, and our architect.  </span></p>
<p><em>Thank you for sharing your design vision and renovation with us!</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing good could come of a crew of firefighters crashing down your door and barreling in to extinguish a roof fire. Could it? Dianna and Todd had been planning to renovate their fifth-floor apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side since the day they’d closed on it. But it was after FDNY firefighters paid them a visit and squelched a soon-to-surge blaze on their 1910 co-op building’s rooftop that they decided to move on their ideas. Their unit sustained no major damage from flames, smoke or water, but the fast-moving defenders destroyed their door and its frame and left behind a trail of broken plaster and blemished floors.</span></p>

<p>“We were so appreciative of how quickly and thoroughly the FDNY responded,” Dianna recalled. “We counted eight fire trucks and 35 firemen.” The close call affirmed their love for the high-floor dream duplex, which they had lived in for three years. And now Dianna, an advertising agency director, and Todd, a college professor, had the incentive they needed to turn the 440-square-foot, studio alcove apartment around.</p>
<p>The damaged walls and floors were the most obvious problems, but they weren’t the only ones. The kitchen needed new appliances, and the cabinets and bare sheetrock walls were begging for a facelift. The cramped bathroom had little storage and an old tub with pitted enamel. The wood floors and the treads of the suspended staircase looked scuffed and worn. It had been close to 20 years since the apartment had undergone a renovation. Dianna and Todd wanted to give their place a 21st-century sprucing.</p>

Their big questions? What order to tackle the parts of the project, and of course, what the cost would be. Before bringing </span><a href="https://www.tcinteriordesign.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interior designer Julia Oddo of TC Interiors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> onboard, Dianna and Todd had <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free service that connects home renovators with vetted general contractors. Sweeten’s Client Services provided a vetted list of contractors and helped the homeowners compare competing quotes. Soon, they had </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their chosen Sweeten contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed on and a start-to-finish renovation plan on paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contractors felt the couple could hold spending down by keeping the existing layout, putting the bulk of the work into the kitchen and bathroom, and updating the other areas with color and practical design.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40174 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-21.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-21-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-21-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40173 mb-0 size-full" title="television" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-20.jpg" alt="television" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-20-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-20-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dianna and Todd’s contractors advised them that they could and should scratch below the surfaces in the areas where they really wanted to see change—not only on the ruined walls and floors, but in the kitchen and bath, too. Elsewhere, they could focus on simpler upgrades and still feel wowed by the results. Their plan for the kitchen was to spring for shiny new appliances, refresh the cabinetry, and add a luxe-looking backsplash. The bathroom would receive a complete overhaul, including a glass-walled shower. The floors and floating staircase would get a stain-and-paint makeover. In the living and sleeping spaces, the walls would be fixed while other improvements would come from color upgrades and new furnishings. The end goal: Modernize the apartment while increasing the functionality of every space.</span></p>
<p>The “magic of paint,” transformation, as Dianna calls it, began with the floors. The contractors sanded the honey-toned wood throughout, then restained the surfaces in a striking near-black; a gray overwash muted the inky result, making the floors look lived-on and lessening the need for constant cleaning.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To counter the dark floors, the couple opted for bright-white walls in the living room, lightening it up and giving it a fresh, clean look. One of the ah-hah! moments of the renovation, however, surprised everyone. When the contractor took down some marred plaster in the living room, workers revealed a stretch of red brick underneath. “It had so much character,”  Dianna said. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left it exposed</a>.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-18.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40171 size-full" title="kitchen cabinets and stove" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-18.jpg" alt="kitchen cabinets and stove" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40165 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen table" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-12.jpg" alt="kitchen table" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Dianna-Stockdale-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen was an oft-used room and a priority, but the couple decided against a gut job. They felt it had keepable components, and decided to preserve the black-granite countertop and cabinetry, which would be easy to update with paint. Once again, the clients wanted to do away with honey-brown wood, so the Sweeten contractor sanded and repainted the cabinets and doors in an almost-white greige and added new black-iron hardware. The savings allowed the homeowners to splurge on fun tile instead. Dianna chose handmade Moroccan terra cotta tile to create a stunning textured backsplash. They chose high-end appliances in a classic stainless finish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bedroom, flanking the kitchen and living-room space, came together around the “something-old” rug the couple had wanted to keep. It served as a perfect centerpiece for a room with a more romantic feel and connected with the other rooms as well. The couple chose a neutral upholstered headboard to blend with the greige-painted walls. The cheery coral color comes in pops and the navy in unexpectedly blue bedside tables and wall art. A small corner became a classic-meets-modern vanity nook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple’s bathroom, the biggest job of all, began with their general contractor’s gutting of the space. With the old tub, shower curtain, and clunky wall-mounted medicine cabinet gone, the room felt much bigger. They decided to go with shiny white subway tile on the walls and a simple and contemporary stand-up shower with a glass half-wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When workers were unable to install recessed cabinetry over the console sink (more brick behind the sheetrock, this time a negative!), they suggested tucking recessed floor-to-ceiling cabinets behind the door. “It seemed small at the time, but those cabinets provide valuable storage space,” Dianna said. The homeowners splurged on special handmade encaustic tiles in a splashy black-and-white pattern bringing a shot of graphic boldness to the room and connecting it to the whole apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rarely used loft space at the top of the stairs to the roof deck found new life as a library and office space. The staircase’s free-floating wooden steps going from brown to a modern matte black. The banisters got a coat of black as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the renovation was completed, they brought in interior designer Julia Oddo. The homeowners, both fans of a rustic-modern aesthetic, decided on a simple-but-striking color palette, compliments of a Kazakhstan-style rug they had purchased and wanted to keep. The soft, tufted carpet had a bold black, white, and coral pattern. They decided that the made-over apartment would have a dominant scheme of bold blacks and whites, soothed by a livable, muted gray-beige on the walls of the smaller areas. Coral would serve as an accent color, along with a classic navy blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key pivot was the changing-up of the light fixtures; the homeowners chose hanging wall sconces for the living room and bedroom, where floor and table lamps had formerly demanded too much space. For furnishings, the couple chose a neutral three-seater sofa and swapped a large shelving unit for floating bookshelves and a console TV stand. Dual-purpose ottomans double as extra seating and storage. Julia had other ideas for making the most of every inch, by using flexible furniture in transition spaces. In the pass-through between kitchen and living room, they found space for a drop-leaf table to accommodate dinner-party guests and used floating shelving to create a reach-up “bar cart” on the wall.</span></p>

But rounding up measurements, researching products, placing orders and chasing deliveries, Dianna explained, required time and proved stressful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, though, living with the rewards of their hard work, they feel nothing but happy. “The end result is amazing!” Dianna said. “Sometimes we just sit here, and stare in awe.”</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, Dianna and Todd, for sharing your home with us!</span></em></p>

<p>DESIGN NOTES FROM TC INTERIORS’ JULIA ODDO:</p>
<p><em>The inspiration for this project was the rug that Dianna and Todd once had in their living room. The rug, now in their bedroom, has a soft coral design mixed with a black-and-white pattern. The couple also mentioned that they loved navy, which I thought would pair perfectly with the colors of the rug. </em></p>
<p><em>With their style being rustic modern, I combined smooth and polished elements (a modern wall-hung vanity, side table, poufs) with textured ones (bedroom sconces, a console table, chaise longue, and other accents). Choosing the rug for the main area was tricky because of the layout and functionality of the space. We went with a custom carpet that pulled the whole space together. We had a lot of fun bringing color in with artwork, pillows, and small accessories. I wanted</em> <em>the space to not only look aesthetically pleasing but to give it personal touches so it feels like home.</em></p>

Their white-glove apartment was submerged under several inches of water—the result of a leak in an apartment several floors above.</p>

However, the problem worsened<span style="color: #333333;"> during the initial remediation period. </span>Dehumidifiers were brought in to dry out the water damage, but the walls, ceilings, and floors harbored such high levels of moisture that black mold developed in the summer heat. After three long rounds of mold remediation, the apartment was finally cleared for renovation at the end of 2016.</p>

Jean visited and saw the damage, plus what remained of an impressive art collection—amassed over a lifetime of travels, including Picassos and ancient sculptures. The scope of work was to include not only the kitchen, where the leak began, but<span style="color: #333333;"> also other parts of the apartment, including the adjacent hallway pantry, laundry room, guest room and bath, and the formal dining room. Eventually, the homeowners decided to convert their now-grown son’s bedroom into a study, and their daughter&#8217;s former room into a lounge/exercise space.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their Sweeten contractor gutted all of the floors, walls, and ceilings and then began the work of restoration. The couple was interested in restoring what was previously there while bringing a freshness and openness to space by choosing new materials and finishes. The kitchen, which had sported a stainless steel backsplash, outdated cabinets, and inadequate lighting, was given a makeover that included custom gray cabinets paired with white quartz countertops and a unique amazonite backsplash.<span style="color: #333333;"> The homeowner explained, &#8220;We visited the stone yard with the contractor and marked the piece out. We wanted it bookended and to come together in an inverted V over the sink.&#8221; This was done over both the sink in the walk-through pantry as well as the main kitchen space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38896 size-full" title="taupe-kitchen-cabinets-and-tile-flooring" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Julie-Marcuse-Apt-24.gif" alt="taupe kitchen cabinets and tile flooring and white countertop after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" /></a>New pendants were added to light up the breakfast table, where the duo generally eats all their meals unless they are entertaining a larger group. “If we want to have more people over, we use the dining room, but otherwise we eat in the kitchen,” the homeowner said. Both the oval-shaped table and radiator cover were designed by the homeowners which their contractors commissioned to have made. Useful storage solutions were added including a dedicated spice drawer and a movable cart outfitted with a cutting board that can be moved wherever needed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the refrigerator was relocated from the hallway pantry area to the main kitchen space, which made it much easier to access, and a smaller, secondary refrigerator was added instead. “I’m a big condiments person, so we made sure to add room for them,” the homeowner said.</p>

It includes works on paper and canvas; bronze and wood sculpture, ceramics and ceremonial objects. The hope was that the renovation would open up sufficient space and light to showcase these many objects of beauty and turned out to be one of the most gratifying aspects of the renovation.</p>

The homeowner designed a custom built-in wall unit that mixed open shelving and cabinets and worked with their Sweeten contractor to bring it to life.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">In what had been their now-grown daughter&#8217;s bedroom, the homeowners envisioned a serene and comforting space for lounging as well as exercise. The walls were painted lavender, inspired by an acrylic and paper painting that had been done by a friend. This was a theme throughout their home: &#8220;We wanted to give the artwork room to breathe, and to be the inspiration for the color palette in each room.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39677 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39946 mb-0 size-full" title="window-near-accent-wall" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg" alt="window corner and accent wall after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-JulieMarcuse-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Concurrently, they also decided to replace all of their landmarked windows. This alone took 3-4 weeks, and the Sweeten contractor had to make sure to protect the built-ins and previous renovation work. He also topped</span> </span><span class="s1">all of the windowsills with Caesarstone.</span></p>
<p>The homeowners are so happy to be back in their apartment, after pushing through<span style="color: #333333;"> over </span>two years of negotiations, paperwork, and red tape—not to mention mold, dust, and debris in every corner of their home. ”You come to realize, what one person thinks is a good job is not what another person might consider a good job,” the homeowner said. “Sweeten was so supportive. They called periodically when we were getting very disheartened. They sent us three contractors to interview, which was a huge relief. I’m doing this for the first time, and I was totally out of my comfort zone. We had no idea how to pick people—so Sweeten was incredibly helpful.”</p>
<p>They report that even though they felt like giving up on many occasions, they persevered. What seems like courage is really having &#8220;no choice&#8221;. This was their home. We were happy to hear that the best part of the whole situation was their Sweeten contractor, who delivered what he promised and more.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp" alt="Penthouse remodel on the Upper West Side" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once home to Nora Ephron, John Lennon, and countless other writers, artists, and musicians, the Upper West Side boasts a lively history that’s been captured in a myriad of films and immortalized in books. Broadway runs through it, and landmarks like the Apthorp, the Dakota, and Lincoln Center lend their impressive architecture to the texture of the neighborhood. The brownstone-lined blocks are quiet in the early mornings and evenings, making it an ideal spot for city dwellers seeking solitude. Join us as we take a look at some of the <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> renovations in the neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Empty nesters return home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side.jpg" alt="apartment remodel on Upper West Side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58112 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-remodel-on-Upper-West-Side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob relocated back to Manhattan</a> after working in the Midwest and South for some time. They found an apartment on the Upper West Side that satisfied their desire for pre-war architectural details. However, living with modern amenities meant updating the electrical wiring which was not expected, but had to be done. <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adding a washer/dryer</a> and a dedicated home office space were top of their list. After living in the suburbs with easy access to laundry units, they never wanted to be without them in Manhattan again. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen was overhauled</a> and they loved ditching the bathtub for a large shower stall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they had past renovation knowledge, every experience had its unexpected nuances. They felt relieved to have Sweeten as the backstop when needed.</span></p>
<h3>The right fit with small-space appliances</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="kitchen on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58113" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kitchen-on-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Sweeten homeowner made it clear in her posting that an electrical upgrade would be <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-90-square-foot-manhattan-kitchen-revives-in-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required for her project</a>. To put the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen plan into action</a>, she hired a woman-owned contracting firm through Sweeten. The plan included replacing the electrical box and addressing plumbing issues before installing a new sink and faucet. Another top focus was purchasing small-sized appliances such as an 18&#8243; dishwasher, a 24&#8243; fridge, and a 20&#8243; range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner appreciated the way her <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor worked with her</a> during the remodel; it was a solution-based approach. When they ran into budget issues, the contractor offered alternative solutions that proved just as effective. Constant communication was highlighted as the reason for her smooth renovation. Similarly, we also checked in periodically with the homeowner. While no issues arose with the contractor, the homeowner found comfort in having us available to step in, if needed.</span></p>
<h3>A penthouse overhaul</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp" alt="Penthouse remodel on the Upper West Side" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58105" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side.webp 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-300x200.webp 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Penthouse-remodel-on-the-Upper-West-Side-600x400.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Film director and novelist <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan Eliasberg made the decision</a> to purchase a penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side. Few were willing to undertake the dual challenge of acquiring a property and renovating it in the third month of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1,750-square-foot apartment presented numerous challenges, including roof leaks, asbestos-laced glue under the linoleum, mold, and a perplexing layout. With the help of her Sweeten contractor and a designer, they strategically modified the apartment, creating a seamless flow that emphasized the elegance of the tall ceilings and original windows. While addressing code violations, asbestos hazards, and water damage, the contractor&#8217;s professionalism and expertise proved invaluable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping within the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parameters of the co-op&#8217;s remodeling budget</a>, Jan successfully completed her project despite unforeseen obstacles, including Jan being the first homeowner to have central air installed in her apartment in the building’s history.</span></p>
<h3>A small bathroom remodeling success</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="black bathroom on the upper west side with walk in shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/black-bathroom-on-the-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/a-bath-refresh-from-leaky-to-luxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veronica&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a> was always on the to-do list, but it felt overwhelming and expensive. However, things took a turn when she received a complaint from her downstairs neighbors about a leak from her tub. This incident prompted Veronica to take on the challenge of renovating the entire bathroom. She met with several Sweeten <a href="https://sweeten.com/ny/manhattan-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractors who did work on the Upper West Side</a> and chose the right one to partner with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her favorite additions was the walk-in shower, which not only made the space feel more open but also gave it a modern touch. She further improved the room&#8217;s aesthetics by opting for a wall-mounted sink instead of an 18-inch vanity, which wouldn’t have stored much anyway. Although she initially planned to install a wall-mounted toilet, it didn’t fit the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/">bathroom remodeling budget nor the permit costs</a> it would require.</span></p>
<h3>Vital communication skills</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg" alt="apartment remodel on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58115" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/apartment-on-upper-west-side-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tijesh, an experienced renovator, discovered his 750-square-foot <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/upper-west-side-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted his project</a> to find a GC. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin his apartment remodel</a>, his list of &#8220;must-haves&#8221; included installing Brazilian hardwood flooring, revamping the electrical system and three closets, and modernizing both the kitchen and bathroom. For example, a peninsula connected the newly-opened kitchen to the dining room space.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan for the bathroom upgrade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved challenging with no ability to rearrange the plumbing. Therefore, the solution was a rip-and-replace with streamlined fixtures and a glass-enclosed walk-in shower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were some unexpected hiccups and delays during the remodel but his Sweeten contractor kept the project moving along. He even sent progress photos when Tijesh was away. He appreciated his contractor’s communication style and reliable expertise.</span></p>
<h3>Built-ins organize a home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-32574 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN_ChristineApt-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />As an Upper West Sider, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/christines-art-filled-upper-west-side-redesign-and-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christine</a> guided her apartment search by one very important piece of criteria: the new place could be no more than 10 blocks from Zabar’s! Unfortunately, the right location came with outdated finishes and peeling paint. She hired a Sweeten contractor who helped Christine renovate the kitchen and <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build custom built-in cabinets</a> in every room. The shelves stored her massive collection of books and artwork, adding character to the space.</p>
<h3>Open flow brings in the light</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen on upper west side" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58117 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/open-kitchen-on-upper-west-side-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bigger home was just what <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/sophia-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophia and Leon</a> needed when they decided to grow their family. The apartment they found on the Upper West Side had been laid out like a rabbit warren. Although the latest arrival to their family was tiny, the space would have to fit the three of them comfortably for years to come. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remodeling budget for the kitchen</a> facilitated the removal of the walls and connected it to both the living and dining rooms on either side. There was now plenty of room for the family plenty to spread out. The decision for an open-plan also came with the added bonus of improving the flow of natural light throughout the space.</p>
<h3>A new floorplan makes the difference</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-23151 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/overhauling-upper-west-side-co-op-make-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsay and Tim</a> landed on Central Park West when it came time to purchase their first home together. The apartment had plenty of square footage, but the rooms felt dark and cramped. They planned on <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restructuring the co-op layout</a> to join the kitchen with the dining room. This created the perfect spot to host dinner parties, while classic finishes and a muted palette throughout paid homage to the apartment&#8217;s prewar roots.</p>
<h3>A new layout welcomes a nursery</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="Contemporary white and black bathroom" width="1600" height="1105" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 1600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x207.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-600x414.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparing for a baby meant shuffling the floorplan of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karen and Kevin&#8217;s</a> Upper West Side apartment to fit a nursery and a kid-friendly bathroom. The small dining area at the end of the kitchen was sealed off and transformed into the baby&#8217;s room. Additionally, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom needed a refresh</a>. The grimy tiling was replaced with crisp white subway tile while the bulky bath was swapped out for a new, standard-sized tub. As a result, this made room for an open console vanity and a basket of bathtime essentials.</p>

<h3>A galley kitchen opens up</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/heathers-sweetened-upper-west-side-kitchen-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather</a> loved everything about her Upper West Side apartment except the galley kitchen, which was functional but felt like cooking inside of a shoebox. Her Sweeten renovation opened up the kitchen to the dining room, converting the half wall into a peninsula with deep storage drawers on one side and bar seating on the other. The transformation was just what she needed to take the space from just another place in the world to her home sweet home.</p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31826 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Olivia and Greg were expecting their first child when they began the remodel on their 1,300-square-foot co-op in a classic Upper West Side prewar building. Olivia, a journalist, and Greg, a lawyer, thought the neighborhood would be perfect for kids with its beautiful parks, play areas, and museums. The apartment had great details—large windows, plenty of light, built-in bookshelves, and nice moldings—but needed a serious refresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found the right contractor</a> to create the contemporary look they were after. They wanted to update the kitchen and a bathroom—which later became both bathrooms—with new tiles and fixtures, plus enlarge the master bathroom. In the master bedroom, they needed a brand new built-in closet. But the pressure to finish before their baby&#8217;s birth added an extra layer of stress and it all came down to the wire.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31699 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath-Before01-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31826 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7407-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Olivia-Cabinet-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31873 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-glass-panelled-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Olivia-Cabinet-GIF.gif" alt="white glass panelled kitchen cabinets over marble countertop and closed kitchen cabinets underneath after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their previous kitchen in the West Village was small and they were excited to trade up to the larger space in their new home. Pipes in the walls made it difficult to move anything, so to keep costs down, they kept the same footprint. The existing kitchen cabinets were a mismatched black-and-white assortment, and Olivia imagined her dream space as a modern, all-white kitchen. They decided to reface most of the cabinets, painting them white with new hardware. The cabinets above the sink didn’t correctly fit the space, so custom cabinetry was crafted for the uppers as well as the lower cabinetry in the midsection of the kitchen, where pots and pans used to hang. There, another piece was designed to fit the space better with more storage built above, featuring glass doors to display their wedding china and glassware.</p>

<blockquote><p>The shower was so tiny, Olivia said, By the middle of my pregnancy, I could barely fit in it!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7439.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31828 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/MG_7439-723x1085.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the couple loves to cook and are big cookbook collectors, they created a nook to display some of their favorites. They kept the appliances, which were brand new. For the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>, porcelain tile resembling dark wood that was more durable and stain-resistant replaced the old red tile. “Definitely a plus with a new baby,” Olivia said. Now, the wood look matched the rest of the apartment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were outdated. In the master bath, the shower was so tiny, Olivia said, “By the middle of my pregnancy, I could barely fit in it!” The fixtures were old and the shower floor was plastic rather than tile. They really wanted a larger, more luxurious master bath and their dream was to have double vanities. To achieve this, they took space from an existing hallway and a closet in the master bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31704 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-723x1085.jpg" alt="home renovation Manhattan" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor was able to design a seat in the shower to look like it was floating, sizing it just right so it wouldn’t take up too much space. “We wanted something that looked good but was also functional so that I could shave my legs and relax during a hot shower,” Olivia said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They ended up adding the guest bathroom about two months into the project—it was not in the original budget. “I ended up convincing Greg that if we didn&#8217;t update it now, it would never get done, especially with the baby coming when we would be very preoccupied,” Olivia said. “Our contractor was able to work with us to get it done in a cost-effective and timely manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The walls were painted dark gray in stark contrast to the bright white vanity and shower subway tiles. Olivia was inspired by the restaurant Union Fare in Union Square and wanted to replicate the style. “The contractor initially thought we were crazy,” she said, “but he ended up liking it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To replace the lost closet in the master bedroom, their contractor created an envy-inducing new unit from California Closets. He was meticulous in his measuring to make sure that they could still have a king-sized bed, two nightstands, and closet doors that wouldn&#8217;t open up into the bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designwise, they wanted adequate space for the two of them to hang clothes and for well-spaced shelving to fit items like sweaters. “I’m also pretty short,” Olivia said, “so we had to make sure that the hanging bar was low enough that I could still access my dresses and sweaters. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/closet-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closets</a> are amazing and really feel like a huge luxury.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As if remodeling isn’t stressful enough, the pressure to stay on schedule was ever present. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moved out</a> during the renovation. “We had tools and dust littering the baby’s nursery just two weeks before Olivia&#8217;s due date, which definitely made us all nervous,” Greg said. Luckily, their Sweeten contractor was extremely responsive to them any time of day. “As <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/how-5-couples-renovated-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first-time homeowners</a>, we had a million questions, and he couldn&#8217;t have been nicer and more professional to deal with,” Olivia said. “He also has an incredible eye for design, so we didn&#8217;t need to hire an outside designer to help us make decisions for items like the backsplash or tiles.” They shared their <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sweetenhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest</a> boards and their contractor pulled materials matching their inspiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even as newbies, though, the couple had faith in the process. They learned to be patient and to check up on the work as often as they could to get in front of any problems. They discovered that “renovating can be addicting! Once you start, you&#8217;ll begin to realize all the imperfections in your home which could add on tens of thousands of dollars to your project,” said Olivia. “But don’t get distracted. Stick with the original plan; you can always renovate again at another point.” In the end, it all worked out. The renovations were done in early December and Max was born the day after Christmas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A long-distance relationship blooms, from start to reno punch list</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kim and Ian were both far from home when a chance encounter in Spain brought them together. When the couple decided to close the distance between them—10,000 miles!—they found a studio apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. The previous tenant had lived in the home for nearly half a century, and during a walk-through, Kim and Ian discovered that the original plumbing and wiring were in need of an overhaul. Challenges aside, the space was just the right size for the two of them and full of good vibes—not to mention a fortuitous discovery in one of the walls. Ready to make it their home, the couple embraced a gut renovation of the entire apartment. Read on for Ian’s take on their remodeling journey.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The story begins in northern Spain along the Camino de Santiago, where an aging Aussie trial lawyer met and fell in love with a not-so-aging American nurse who just happened to be working in Manhattan and living in Bayonne, New Jersey. Many cross-Pacific flights later, plans were made for a wedding in Hawaii and the purchase of an apartment somewhere on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where we could live together when I was able to escape court commitments in Sydney. With both of us having been married before with adult children, there was no need for a large apartment, but there was a definite need for the best use of a small space.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_5482-e1517858044570.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30576 size-chrono" title="Kim and Ian" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_5482-e1517858032829-723x542.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="542" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Sweeten homeowners Kim and Ian<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30486 mt-24 size-chrono" title="Ian" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT20-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30496 size-chrono" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before05-1-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The search for an affordable apartment was challenging to say the least. But thanks to the StreetEasy website and FaceTime (for my wife in Bayonne and myself in Sydney), a studio apartment in a 1915 co-op was located and purchased. The 450-square-foot space was previously owned by a retired nun who had lived in it for some 45 years (long enough ago to remember John and Yoko walking down the street from the Dakota apartments). The old girl (the apartment!) required a total renovation but had a good vibe about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30517 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-Before06-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30521 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During03-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(During) Laying down pipe for the island<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30487 mt-24 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT05-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that I am from Sydney and my wife is from Bayonne, locating a suitable contractor was also challenging. After much Googling, I located the Sweeten website and was immediately fascinated by the Sweeten concept. So much so, that more out of interest than any real expectation, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted a quick job description</a> on the website and a hopeful (very hopeful!) budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With hindsight, I understated the renovation work required to a significant extent. While awaiting responses from Sweeten, I also contacted contractors I had identified from various magazines and other websites. Immediate ballpark quotes of $150k upwards from these folks sent shivers through my bones. Then interviews with potential contractors were arranged by Sweeten with the search ending in a coin toss between the two final contractors. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deciding on the Sweeten contractor</a>, who won out largely because he was both a qualified architect and builder, the renovating process began. The detailed quoted price was more than reasonable and way under $150k quoted by others.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30520 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Right) Hidden window discovered<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30519 mt-24 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30489 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suppose it&#8217;s axiomatic that the design stage of any renovation is not ideal when one of the players lives mainly overseas. But as luck would have it, a trial in Sydney collapsed and I was able to fly to New York for a thorough “walk through” with my wife Kim and our contractor after the building contract was signed. I had two absolute requirements—a new soaking <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solid oak flooring</a> throughout. Kim also had absolute requirements: a nice cooking area and island, and new everything else! After weeks of to-and-froing, preparing and amending the plans, work was ready to commence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s no exaggeration to say that what was required was, in effect, a gut renovation of the whole apartment. Laying new oak flooring was going to require the removal of two layers of old parquetry flooring. Hidden in the wall adjacent to the neighboring building (a contemporary high-rise) were two old large windows from a time when the building next door was an old brownstone. Our contractor’s eyes lit up at the sight, explaining how he could remove the windows and use the cavity space for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage cabinets</a> and counter space, both considered premiums in NYC studio apartments. I am a lover of wood, and the contractor proposed the cabinets and doors be made of American walnut and mahogany veneer. The final look and function of both pieces of furniture—a matching clothes cabinet hangs at the foot of the bed—are terrific and make excellent use of an otherwise wasted wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30494 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30493 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Plans for the main space involved splitting the studio into a cooking/dining/working area and a living/sleeping area. With the kitchen island as the primary divider, the plans were fine-tuned, including a design for a reconfigured bathroom. To be effective, a complete <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewiring</a> and re-plumbing of the whole apartment was required. This also involved breaking into the ceiling of the apartment below ours to put in new pipes and ball joints as required by the co-op management. Our Sweeten contractor did all the arranging with the downstairs apartment owner and diplomatically handled inevitable noise complaints. The guts were ripped out of the apartment and walls replaced.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The price quoted by the contractor to do the building work did not include the appliances, bath fixtures and other items such as tile, lighting, and flooring. We made use of various websites and sourced mainly high-end products, all of which when installed look fabulous and add value to the overall project. The sourcing and purchasing of items over the Internet was a real boon, seamlessly saving both shoe leather and thousands of dollars in cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Timing became an issue. Our contractor’s hope at the outset was for the project to be completed within three to four months. But with the unforeseen need for the gut renovation, including rewiring and re-plumbing, the project did blow out substantially in timing. Waiting for the soaking tub (Kaldewei) to come from Germany, the kitchen feature light (Vistosi) to come from Italy, and the kitchen faucet (Franke) to come from Switzerland also prolonged the completion date by months. Luckily, we both had other homes in which to live while the work took place. Now that the work’s done, the angst with the delay seems trivial.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally moved into the apartment in early December 2017 when I arrived from Sydney for an extended stay with Kim in New York. Living here has been terrific. And I’ve put the tub to good use throughout the very cold winter! The layout, feel, and livability of the apartment has exceeded my expectations. We’ve had some teething issues with bits and pieces (cracked tile, cabinetry needing adjusting, painting touch-ups) but our contractor has been most attentive to fixing any problem that has arisen. I must say though, as a Sydney-sider, the street noise in NYC coming into the apartment is a bit louder than I had expected. But as one of Kim’s friends said to me, “Soak it up mate, it’s all part of the New York experience.” Let the good times continue!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>With a lot of wasted space, Rashmi knew a more efficient floor plan was in order</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28399 mb-0 size-chrono" title="Rashmi" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Rashmi_Sachan_Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel Manhattan" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Intelligent use of space in a Manhattan kitchen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: When Rashmi purchased a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side, she wanted to renovate the kitchen immediately. It was clearly run down, as the original kitchen in a prewar building, but had plenty of unused space and potential. “Once I moved in, I realized I needed to live with the space to understand what I really wanted,” said Rashmi. She gave herself six months—it took four years. At one stage, she even stored her bike in some dead space next to the fridge. She didn’t like the idea of an open kitchen, so knocking down a wall wasn’t an option. The main goal was to simply use the space effectively while flipping a hodgepodge of different whites into something bright.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Rashmi had owned a home before, but buying into a co-op was a new experience. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/11729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> and found a contractor through <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors. She was having problems getting her package submitted to her co-op board for approval until she found her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;My contractor was an invaluable partner, especially during the planning and approval phase with my co-op and the building engineers,” she said. Once work got underway, Rashmi decided to give the kitchen a roomier feel by opting for 18-inch cabinets on one side rather than the standard 24 inch. Adding a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer and dryer</a> was also “life-changing.” A layout geared toward casual entertaining was also important, so she <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended the counter</a> right along the wall to include an eat-in perch and two chairs. Rather than go with backsplash tiles, Rashmi chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semi-gloss paint</a> for ease of cleaning. She picked a bright yet deep blue for the walls that contrasted with gold-toned cabinet hardware.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Rashmi worked from home, so her Sweeten contractor and his team were conscious that they were sharing the same workspace. “They worked clean and were as quiet as possible,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Last year, Lindsay and Tim bought their first home together<i>—</i>a sprawling two-bedroom apartment on Central Park West. The couple—a medical student and financial analyst, respectively—saw the potential to create an incredible home for themselves, but had a list of renovation items to tackle first. With Sweeten&#8217;s help, they created a classic but thoroughly contemporary apartment with room to grow. By updating their existing kitchen and baths, they carved out new spaces for living, working, and entertaining. Read on for how they reconfigured walls to add an expanded office, a half bath, </i><em>AND bonus storage space </em><i>to their prewar apartment! </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23151 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Tim Laurie</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After purchasing our first apartment together in June of 2016, my wife, Lindsay, and I decided to take on a co-op renovation in order to make it our perfect living space. We were attracted to the location and design of the 1929 Art Deco building on Central Park West, but the interior of the apartment left a lot to be desired. The 1,500-square-foot home offered a very spacious feel, with nine-foot ceilings and light coming through windows on three sides of the apartment. The layout, however, was dated and not very efficient. The “before” layout consisted of a cramped corner kitchen, large but divided living and dining spaces both of which had duplicate doorways on both sides, old en-suite bathrooms, and a dark walk-in closet converted to a cavernous office space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23304 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.001-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.001" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23305 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Before-and-After-Floorplans.002-720x540.jpeg" alt="Before and After Floorplans.002" width="720" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When planning the new layout, first and foremost, our renovation needed to address the practical features that were lacking. Specifically, we wanted: 1) a toilet that didn&#8217;t require guests to venture on an embarrassing trek through a bedroom in order to get to an en-suite bathroom; 2) more usable space, such as a den or optional third bedroom; 3) a washer and dryer in the apartment; and 4) a larger, but not galley-like, kitchen. With the help of Sweeten, we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/10047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> and went with the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contractor</a> that stood out as most reliable, reassuring, and within our cost estimate. We initially interviewed five contractors for our project, and received three quotes. Our contractor was not the least nor the most expensive, but he offered to include the finishing touches on our apartment to ensure we got the most out of our renovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23378 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Manhattan renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03-2-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23154 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-06" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23156 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23157 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change in the kitchen was changing the entrance from a narrow doorway to a wide foyer and pass-through, allowing us to add a bar area, more counter space, and plenty of light. Our contractor helped us with the kitchen layout and where to place the washer/dryer so it connected to our water lines. We went with stainless steel Frigidaire appliances, adding a separate bar fridge under the counter to make up for a shallower built-in refrigerator that we chose. A stainless backsplash tile with white grout and slate gray floor tiles contrasts well with the white custom cabinets and brushed nickel handles throughout. We love the custom wine rack, glass cupboard, and bar shelf on one side of what used to be a duplicate doorway. A powder room—formerly small storage space—was also installed off the kitchen with double half doors, to take up less clearance space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23158 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-11" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23159 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-14" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of design, we wished to open up the main space by removing the mirrored french doors and a wall blocking the light between the living and dining rooms. For a modernized look, our plan included staining the hardwood floors, painting and papering the walls, and adding crown and floor molding. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">living room</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we removed the non-functional decorative plaster fireplace and the walls between the living and dining rooms to open up the main living space. A large dining room table from Pottery Barn (which nearly didn&#8217;t fit up the elevator) and chandelier sit between the bar and new office door. In this same area, we were able to build a third bedroom/den with french glass doors for light to shine through.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our en-suite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned out beautifully, with our master bath getting floor-to-ceiling tile in the shower and on the feature wall, as well as a custom-built vanity and top-mounted sink. The white, tan, and natural sand colors flow nicely into the main bedroom, which also got repainted. The guest en-suite bathroom is filled with clean white subway tiles and Carrara marble flooring, as well as an ebony vanity with matching Carrara countertop. Although the renovation progressed well from our standpoint, the contractors had their work cut out for them! They had to cut back old bathroom tiling and build new walls. We also had to replace old bathroom plumbing within the concrete deck floors, which was unexpected, but handled well by the subcontractors that our Sweeten contractor hired.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23307 mb-24 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15-723x1084.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-15" width="723" height="1084" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-23308 size-chrono" title="Central Park West renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Tim_Kitchen_Bathroom-16" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly expanded but cozy and carpeted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bonus room for studying and work, accessible through the new matching french doors off the dining room, rather than from the bedroom hallway. The office neatly fits our double desk and two chairs, as well as a bookshelf. A new transom window in the hallway allows more light to shine through. </span>We were especially excited about a tweed Edinburgh gray wallpaper that we chose for the entrance foyer, which makes a big statement right when you enter the apartment. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least is the updated &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">garage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; where we leave the bikes, storage, and our cat&#8217;s litter box. This storage room was coated with a fresh coat of white paint and new gray tile as well, giving it a clean look despite its utilitarian purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Overall, we are very pleased with the renovation of our Central Park West co-op apartment. At the end, we decided to add extras along the way, which extended the project time frame by several weeks and stretched our budget slightly; however, our contractor did his best to complete these while not adding labor to the total bill. He was detail-oriented and very patient, despite a lengthy co-op approval process.</span><span class="s2"> The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team kept the work to a reasonable time frame of just over three months and were very understanding as we lived through the process.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Compact kitchen overhaul in an Upper West Side high-rise studio</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Despite its condition, the owner, who works in real estate, actually remembers his old 85-square-foot kitchen with surprising fondness. Beneath a harsh fluorescent fixture, low-end plastic laminate cabinets and counters were worn and stained. Above the 1980’s white stove, the hood’s exposed exhaust hose was sloppily sealed using pieces of tape. The floor was a dated black-and-white resilient tile checkerboard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The delighted owner notes that this “reno way exceeded my expectations.” As his Sweeten profile requested, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his contractor</a> handled the co-op’s intimidating application process. None of the appliances or worn-out finishes were worth saving—only the new refrigerator was relocated. Glossy modern white cabinets make the space feel less narrow than brown wood upper cabinets could have. Undercabinet LED lights shine onto the engineered quartz countertop. The undulating wall tiles were found on a showroom shopping trip with his contractor, and the owner first saw large-format slate-look floor tiles on design blogs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After spending many years patching up a rental they lived in together, two architects decided to purchase their very own fixer-upper on the top floor of an 1890s brownstone on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. One may wonder whether Kate Meagher and Arthur Liu had the same basic questions as non-design pros when it came to budget calculations, the cost of relocating plumbing, or even where to find a contractor, and the answer is yes! Having fallen in love with the view of the Hudson River, high ceilings, and the fact that the apartment hadn’t been touched since the ‘60s, they embraced the cozy new home to make &lt;500-square-foot feel significantly bigger. The couple came to Sweeten to find a team to help them reconfigure walls, add space to the kitchen, and renovate the bath. Here, Kate and Arthur tell us about their renovation journey, including a painting project that took longer than anticipated—but the results were well worth it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21477" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="723" height="506" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-723x506.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-300x210.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed-600x420.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/unnamed.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21420"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Guest post by Upper West Side homeowner Kate Meagher </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arthur and I had been living in an apartment for around seven years, which belonged to his family. That apartment—much loved—was a constant work in progress. We improved the kitchen and bathroom, installed new lighting, and suffered through two floods (thanks, upstairs neighbors!) which required new ceilings and flooring yet again. As architects, we loved it—it was great to have a rental which we could experiment on. At a certain point, however, it seemed that we should be directing our energy toward a place that was truly ours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During our search, Arthur and I had gotten into a rhythm. After each Sunday’s open house tour, we’d stop in whichever neighborhood we ended up in, get a drink, and sketch floor plans over the broker’s listing sheets. Could we fit a dishwasher? How did the closet compare with our old one? How much would it cost if the plumbing needed to be reconfigured? (Sweeten’s construction and renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> were extremely helpful setting initial <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/renovation-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a> targets.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were obviously looking for a fixer-upper, and when we saw this apartment, we fell in love despite its tiny size. It’s right next to Riverside Park, on the top floor of a beautiful brownstone. The ceilings are high and the bay windows still have the original curved glass. In the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, we can see the Hudson. Best yet, outside of some electrical updates, the apartment hadn’t been touched since the 1960s. The main priorities for this apartment were to update and expand the kitchen, renovate the bathroom, and to squeeze as much storage space in without impacting the small footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had come across Sweeten at some point in our apartment search, and it was the first place we looked for a general contractor after we closed. Arthur and I both work on very large ground-up projects and don’t regularly work with contractors on the scale of a New York apartment renovation—we needed help finding someone! Sweeten definitely filled a niche for us, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we posted our project</a>. We interviewed several and chose <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Sweeten contractor</a>. I was struck by the notes he took throughout our initial walk-through, and that he asked for time to review further on his own. We felt he really listened and understood what we wanted and could accomplish it within our timeframe and budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21455 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Arthur_floor_plan-723x482.jpg" alt="Arthur_floor_plan" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21431 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-03" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21436 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21438 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-07" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21439" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-08" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We love the classic detailing in the apartment and wanted to preserve everything we could that was more or less original. However, both our sensibilities skew contemporary/minimalist when designing, and we were looking to strike a balance. We decided to make only a few key alterations to the floorplan. First, the wall separating the kitchen/bath zone and the living room was moved, gaining us a little more than a foot-and-a-half extra. The bathroom feels more generous now, and most importantly, it allowed us to configure a narrow L-shape for the kitchen. We chose tall doors for them to align with the height of the bay windows, and drew a custom profile for the door frames—beautifully executed by our contractor’s team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The extra L-shaped length was critical to add a full-height refrigerator, full-height pantry cabinet, and an 18” dishwasher. We installed shallow 15-inch-deep cabinets in the new leg, and kept all appliances to the adjacent wall. This preserved as much floor space as possible, and had the added benefit of retaining the original locations for the plumbing, gas lines, and ducted extractor—no permits to file or added expense of rerouting. We wanted a minimal aesthetic—black and white. Ultimately, we took our cues from a soapstone countertop we saw on a Sweeten blog <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. After visiting M. Teixeira’s amazing warehouse, we chose a stone that had a lot of green undertones in the black base. For the cabinet paints, we decided on an extremely dark black-green shade, and a cool white to complement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This space ended up being a special project in the apartment. While our contractor&#8217;s team completed the major work—prepping the walls, installing wood flooring, adding lighting, installing the appliances and sink, and tiling the backsplash—Arthur and I ended up building the rest of the kitchen ourselves (!) using Ikea base cabinets that we modified and custom fronts. We also decided to just paint the fronts ourselves. (*Note: after doing it and coming out the other side, this is NOT recommended. However, if you have the time, patience and space, you will save a lot.) For those of you interested in the details: We needed to paint 26 panels—some over ten ft tall—inside the apartment because, well, that’s the only space we had. Working in stages, we brushed two coats per side, sanded, vacuumed and wiped down with a tack cloth between each coat. And our two cats meant even more obsessive vacuuming and confining them to the bedroom for most of the full month it took to paint—the threat of fur was everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21429 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21441 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-11" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-09-10" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bedroom, our excellent foreman, Al, demolished a loft bed, and combined the small bedroom closet with an adjacent coat closet. We’ve hung a full-height curtain, so we can use every last inch of the ceiling height for storage. The entry door from the living room into the bedroom was moved toward the kitchen. Previously, it was right in the middle of a living room wall, making that room very difficult to furnish. The team expertly restored the plaster walls, and matched new wood flooring inside the closet area and kitchen with the original (our contractor really pulled through with that find!). New moldings were also seamlessly integrated in areas that had been exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21430 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21435 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-04" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21443 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-13" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21432" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom skews warmer in tone than the kitchen, and was designed as a spare and sleek space. We replaced the tub with a wet room—an open shower without curtains or doors—and rain shower head to keep the lines clean and open up the room. (This required an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/business/laa.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAA permit</a>, which called for a master plumber.) A wing wall keeps all the water from splashing out, and conceals a recessed shelf for products. The contractor&#8217;s team—Al specifically—were truly master tilers. We chose a tiny copper ceramic mosaic for the floor, shower curb and base, and creamy white, elongated tile for the walls. The grout is a warm brown that picks up on the terracotta edges of the white tile and the copper tones of the floor tile. We, of course wanted every joint to match and it does. We opted for a large recessed mirrored medicine cabinet to contain clutter and a wall-mounted sink with no cabinet. Everything fits except the hairdryer, which lives in the credenza directly outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21442" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Arthur_Apartment-12" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are so happy with how the project turned out. Maybe it’s the sweat equity, but it is always very satisfying to see your design realized. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without our Sweeten contractor, Al and the team. They were a pleasure to work with throughout and we’d love to collaborate again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thank you so much, Arthur and Kate, for sharing your story. It’s always intriguing to hear about a home renovation from the point of view of architects! We hope you enjoy your new home.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Emily moved to New York City last year, she went in search of an apartment with a warm, old-world feel. Although originally from California, she had recently spent two years living and studying in Normandy, France, where she developed an appreciation for beautiful prewar buildings that wore their age gracefully. Emily loved that the apartments she came across there—no matter how small or simple—always had ornamental features that elevated the space. Paneling, vintage doorknobs, and other small details contributed to an overall elegance, and she wanted the same for her new apartment in New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A six month-long search resulted in the purchase of a 435-square-foot studio apartment in an understated 1940s building on the Upper West Side. It was a prewar apartment but also a condo, a rare combination that suited Emily’s criteria. Although it was a studio, it had distinctly separate spaces: an entryway, dressing area, kitchen, bath, and main living space, which Emily liked. Unfortunately, having been used as a longtime rental property, the apartment had been stripped of most of its original ornamentation. Instead, there was paint a dozen layers thick and worn flooring throughout the studio. In the narrow galley kitchen, there were sticky off-white cabinets, peeling vinyl floors, and almost no counter space at all. The very peachy-yellow bathroom sported tiles that didn’t match in spots where they had once been replaced, and a tank-less, industrial toilet gave the small space an unpleasantly institutional vibe. To the left of the front door, two shallow closets took up valuable floor space, which Emily felt would be better utilized as an office nook.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21368 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-02" width="723" height="482" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21367" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-Before-During-01" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emily envisioned a restoration of sorts: she wanted to add paneling and crown molding to the walls of the main living space, and to create a simple bath with a vintage black-and-white theme. The kitchen would be modern but befitting the age of the building. And although the discrete spaces of the apartment were a major selling point, Emily felt that the narrow kitchen would be much improved if it could be opened up to the main living area. Pinterest provided ample inspiration, and she set out to source the materials herself, relying heavily on <a href="https://www.wayfair.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a> and other online stores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed a concrete plan for the renovation, Emily and her dad, John, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the project</a> to Sweeten. John had had substantial experience with construction and renovation in the past, and with his input, Emily settled on a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a>. The crew quickly went to work realizing Emily’s vision, and also provided helpful suggestions and additions along the way. For example, unprompted, the contractor stripped a half-century of paint from the front door, revealing the beautiful metal patina underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based on Emily’s direction, he created a pass-through from the galley kitchen to the living area, extending the counter through the opening to create a breakfast perch with stools. Open shelving made of marble and brass took the place of upper cabinets, creating more room to breathe in the narrow space. The appliances and sink were lined up on the left, given that the counters and base cabinets on the right were a mere nine inches deep. (The entire kitchen was just about six feet wide!) An under-counter refrigerator, paneled to blend in with the cabinets, preserved the new airiness of the space. Sadly, there was no room for a dishwasher, but a 24-inch gas range fit perfectly at the end of the counter. Finishes were consistent with those found in older buildings, featuring white subway tile, marble counters, brass detailing, charcoal gray lower cabinets, and blackened metal light fixtures with a retro feel. For the floor, Emily chose a fun Spanish tile in black and white.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21360 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21380 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-07-08.gif" alt="" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21362 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21363 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-10" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21364" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-11" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the original dressing area, the floor space was expanded once the closets were removed. Custom shelving and a desk were cut to fit inside the nook perfectly, creating a cozy home office away from the main sleeping area. In the main room of the studio, her Sweeten contractor added small details that restored elegance to the apartment. Marble ledges on the windows, as well as wall paneling, crown molding, and new baseboards transformed the space in subtle but distinct ways. The bathroom received a similarly unpretentious and classic treatment: white subway tile with a beveled edge and black trim, matched to a matte black towel rack. To prevent an accidental burn and to disguise an unsightly floor-to-ceiling radiator pipe, he suggested that they wrap it with rope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21359 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-05" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21355 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-01" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21410 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-12-1-723x997.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="997" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21356 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-02" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, unlike many of Sweeten’s renovating homeowners, Emily and John managed the project from afar—they were in California while her contractor and his team worked on her apartment. They arranged for check-ins via FaceTime or Skype, and he provided photos and updates on the work on a regular basis. Despite the 2,500 miles between them, there were remarkably few hiccups on this Sweeten project. Emily and John attributed this to good communication with the contractor and his team, but also to the fact that they went into the process with a firm plan, and sourced the materials for arrival prior to the start of the job. Emily’s advice to future renovators: “There is a lot that can go wrong when you’re renovating, but it helps to start with a good idea of what you want. And if you source the materials yourself, you can cut down on some of the variables that might delay the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks so much, Emily, and we hope you’re enjoying your lovely new-old studio!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">When Karen and Kevin bought their Upper West Side co-op, they knew there was work to be done. To make the one-bedroom and one-bathroom ready for their family, they hoped to convert a small dining room nook into a nursery for their adorable daughter, Eleanor. Karen, an accountant in the hotel industry, and Kevin, a product manager at a software company, planned to do all renovations before moving in. Approvals took time, and the quest for a contractor stalled as some candidates balked at carving out the nursery space they envisioned. After interviewing several potential teams, Karen <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her apartment renovation project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and met their Sweeten general contractor, who didn’t bat an eye. “He really genuinely understood what we wanted and thought he could do it,” Karen said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/karen-and-kevins-apartment-renovation-sweeten-upper-west-side/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15499 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg" alt="karen's apartment renovation sweeten " width="600" height="379" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karen-kitchen-bathv2-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen’s laminate counters and veneered cabinets were high on the list of issues, and the couple decided to tackle major bathroom grime as part of the overhaul. Karen and Kevin worked with their contractor to design a pocket door for the nursery, prepared to rehab an old windowsill, and planned to freshen up with new paint in a few spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15500" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Karen's Kitchen Sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen_Bathroom-Before-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor&#8217;s team re-oriented the kitchen and removed a service door leftover from an earlier era. The new layout brought the opportunity to eke out more storage in every possible place—which meant custom cutting larger IKEA cabinets to fit the space. “We really wanted to max every inch we possibly could,” Karen said. But those extra inches came at a cost: time. “Custom cutting all of the cabinets was something we didn’t factor into the timeline.” Since the couple was commuting to see progress from where they were living in Red Hook, things often seemed slow, but the expanded storage turned out to be worth the wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the sleek white lacquered cabinets from feeling too space age, Karen and Kevin picked a warm mosaic stone backsplash and a granite countertop from Brooklyn Granite. To keep costs down, Karen tried to snag as many of her Bosch appliances from out-of-state as possible to minimize sales tax. They installed undermount lighting and Karen’s favorite feature: a built-in filtering faucet that makes loading up a fridge filter a thing of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15505 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg" alt="karen's kitchen renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15507 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="karen's kitchen renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-07-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15506 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="karen's kitchen renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-06.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-06-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15508 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="karen's kitchen renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-08.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-08-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom came with an extra long tub that was extra bulky and extra annoying. By removing the enormous 66-inch tub and replacing it with a standard-sized soaker, they made space for a larger, airy vanity with a drawer and storage underneath. “We picked the wood vanity to give it some warmth and more of a masculine feel,” Karen said. Karen was adamant about a recessed medicine cabinet with interior outlets, so gangly appliances like electric toothbrushes stayed out of site. The white subway tile also features it’s own storage niches in sleek black.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To continue the rustic-meets-minimalist vibe, the couple preserved the unfinished wood door, an original feature. After removing about “twenty layers of paint,” the door now opens and closes easily and the original crystal knob pops against the austere backdrop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15503 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15501 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15502" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="karen's bathroom renovation sweeten" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SWEETEN_Karen_Kitchen-Bathroom-02-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen’s advice to fellow renovators stems from the botched delivery of three different toilets. Since the couple wasn’t living in the apartment during the renovation, there was a lapse before each mistake was discovered. “Our contractor warned me about this, make sure you order all the supplies and the contractor has them there right away so no one is waiting for things to arrive.” Karen and Kevin learned to allow and check for items to be on back-order or get delayed and to check deliveries as quickly as possible for accuracy and completeness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although navigating the renovation process combined with caring for a new baby was stressful, the family is thrilled with the results. “Little things popped up, but we dealt with them. There was nothing too crazy or too expensive, and that’s because of our contractor. We had a good working relationship,&#8221; Karen said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, I got to live vicariously through a delightful homeowner&#8217;s Upper West Side kitchen transformation. Hafeeza and her husband made the big move from a 4,500 square foot home in suburban New Jersey to Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side in 2013. After raising five children, Hafeeza and her husband were ready for a retirement relocation that would put the City at their feet and free them from maintaining a large home. They spent a year in a temporary spot before finding the long-term city apartment where they planned to enjoy the essentials: family and friend get-togethers and nightly meals prepared by Hafeeza&#8217;s husband, the devoted family chef. The new space was ideal for those plans, except for the kitchen, which was functional but outdated and lacked the storage and prep space they envisioned. After talking to a number of contractors who weren&#8217;t available for or interested in the scope of the job, Hafeeza took to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> to find a contractor for her list of simple and smart upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/kitchens/upper-west-side-kitchen-and-bathroom-renovation"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11635 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-585x390.png 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath-00-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Our Sweeten Expert was a true professional from the initial meeting until the final payment.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211; Hafeeza M., Upper West Side homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, when I talk to homeowners about their renovations, I get a dose of renovation envy: I want THAT sparkling new kitchen, too! But after talking with Hafeeza, I ended up with something extra and unexpected: a renewed appreciation for New York City living and the William Morris mantra we recently explored on the Sweeten blog. One look at <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/1962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hafeeza&#8217;s Sweeten project post</a> and you can see why. Hafeeza started with a call for<span id="more-11633"></span> a no-frills kitchen upgrade to minimize clutter and simplify the space. Her ideas for big and small upgrades were straightforward and to-the-point, with a few unusual details to tailor the kitchen to her lifestyle and her new city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is enclosed and compact, so Hafeeza planned to add new cabinets, countertops, and appliances, and initially explored removing part of the wall to create a more open feel. The couple also wanted to relocate a closet, coat the entire apartment in fresh paint, and rig the kitchen for a fridge with an ice machine. If I had to name the worldly desires of most New Yorkers, more kitchen space, new paint, and an ice machine might well top the list. However, one request stopped me in my tracks. Hafeeza and her husband wanted to remove the dishwasher. Exclamation points!!! Hafeeza laughed when I helpfully explained to her that a dishwasher is kind of an integral part of a kitchen renovation, if not the holy grail for many new homeowners. She and her husband were certain that they valued more drawer space over the gadget and were happy to pitch in on the dishwashing together. Well. That is a new and interesting dishwashing philosophy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11673 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_02-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11677 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_06-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We matched Hafeeza with Sweeten Expert Pedro who delivered big time with a flawless and angst-free kitchen renovation, first creating clean lines and a unified feel for the cabinets with a plywood base for the upper set, finished in acrylic laminate. The lower set of cabinets and drawers feature acrylic laminate over engineered wood. The glossy finish makes these cabinets easy to keep clean and will guard against dings and wear over time. To create more counter space without changing the room&#8217;s dimensions, Hafeeza relocated the sink from the middle of the counter to the home of the former dishwasher, leveraging plumbing already in place, opening up a more continuous counter prep area, and installing an extra-deep sink basin. Hafeeza chose a stainless steel Blomberg fridge and her husband selected a compact <a href="https://us.bertazzoni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bertazzoni range</a>. They finished the look with Silestone quartz counters, a neutral and luminous glass tile backsplash, and porcelain floor tiles with a faux wood finish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11674 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_03-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11678" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png" alt="SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07" width="600" height="915" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_07-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, Hafeeza and her husband decided to leave the existing kitchen wall in place. Trying to open it would have added only 18 inches to the galley kitchen. Altering the plumbing to get a fridge with an ice machine also turned out to be overly expensive and unnecessary, so they skipped that detail as well. As they adjusted their plans to get the most out of the work, Hafeeza&#8217;s husband mentioned to Pedro that they had some minor upgrades in mind down the road for the bathroom. With a few quick calculations on the back of a napkin, Pedro and the couple realized they could make room in the budget for re-tiling and new fixtures. Hafeeza found the bulk of the new fixtures at <a href="https://www.decorplanet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decor Planet</a> in Manhattan and outfitted the bathroom with an energy efficient dual-flush toilet from <a href="https://www.frescabath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fresca</a>, a full-wall medicine cabinet with mirrors inside and out, and a new vanity with storage drawers topped by a vessel sink. With extra storage, new lighting, and an upgraded shower head, Hafeeza and her husband were thrilled to find that they could re-vamp the bathroom within their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11675 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_04-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11679 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png" alt="upper west side kitchen and bathroom renovation" width="600" height="919" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SWEETEN_hafeezaKitchenBath_08-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After less than a month of work, Hafeeza and her husband moved into their new home to enjoy more than they had bargained for: the new kitchen, fresh paint throughout the apartment, gleaming bathroom finishes, and a space that let them stay focused on family, friends, and their vibrant new neighborhood. I tried (like three times!) to get Hafeeza to pick her favorite part of the new space but she wouldn&#8217;t budge. &#8220;The whole apartment! We&#8217;re just thrilled! We have New York City at our doorstep. What more do you need?!&#8221; Truly, I have been repeating that mantra to myself for the last week. Thank you, Hafeeza, for sharing your space and your unflappable urban dweller attitude with me!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re thrilled to be back on a renovation site under construction where we met up with new tS members, interior design firm, Mendelson Group. The team at Mendelson is a small, closely-knit group of young designers and project managers, lead by firm Principal, Gideon Mendelson. The team&#8217;s portfolio is so rich with interiors that are highly personalized and utterly distinct, we could hardly wait to get behind the scenes to learn more about their process! We caught up with the designers during a check-in meeting with their Upper West Side clients. Qian &amp; Mike, a pair of young professionals, hired Mendelson Group after purchasing their 2000 sqft, 3-bedroom condo, looking to renovate the new home for themselves and their expected newborn.<span id="more-10320"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="house-floor-plan-sketch" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48009 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9.jpg" alt="hard copy or print out of floor plan sketch of a house with a pen on a table before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchase, the condo had modest details and finishes &#8212; it was the type of space you&#8217;d expect to find in a contemporary residential development in Manhattan. For Gideon&#8217;s team and the new homeowners, the goal was to create a stylish, yet functional space with updated finishes &amp; details, focusing much of their attention on gut renovating the kitchen &amp; master bathroom, and creating a fully-custom home office for the working couple.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="apartment-during-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48006 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6.jpg" alt="apartment with large windows and radiators during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-6-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we stopped by, the demolition work was complete, and construction was in the first couple weeks of a 4 month timeline. Here is a look into the main living space from just outside the new office &#8212; straight ahead will be living &amp; dining areas, and back at the right is the kitchen, in its fully gutted form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="kitche- with-window-during -renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48008 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8.jpg" alt="kitchen with window during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The layout of the new kitchen will remain close to the original, while the functionality and materials of the space will become much improved. The designers will increase functionality with taller upper cabinets and an added pantry, just outside the kitchen&#8217;s threshold. They&#8217;ll also replace a set of upper cabinets that had previously blocked Hudson River views with floating shelves where the family can store everyday glassware. High-end materials for the new kitchen include custom lacquered cabinetry, and polished statuary marble counters &amp; backsplash, for a blend of modern and traditional aesthetics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="baseboard-trims-selection" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48005 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-5.jpg" alt="baseboard trims of various sizes and shapes for selection before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Architectural detailing throughout the new space will also mix modern and traditional style elements. When we visited, the designers had prepared this mockup of a traditional over-door and crown molding detail for the foyer space to show the homeowners. After comparing a few options, Qian &amp; Mike were pleased to approve the designers&#8217; proposal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="tile-color-selection-before-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48003 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-3.jpg" alt="tiles color selection for various rooms before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, Sara, from the Mendelson team, shows us some of the other material samples they brought to review with the homeowners. The direction of the decor combines neutral textures &amp; graphic patterns in a way that is fresh and unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The samples in hand are the floor and wall coverings that will be used in the new library. The floor covering is a Stark carpet called “Tandy” in Marble, and the wall covering is a Phillip Jeffries paper called <a href="https://www.phillipjeffries.com/shop/wallcoverings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Gilded Age” in Breakers Blue</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="work-in-progress-of-a-room" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48007 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7.jpg" alt="man working in a room with large window and radiator during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This room will house the library/home office &#8212; one of the spaces we are most excited to see completed. Here, the walls are being prepped for the Phillip Jeffries wall covering (previous photo). The library will also be outfitted with custom millwork in a bleached &amp; stained white oak; custom pieces include desks, shelving and paneling. Double-wide pocket doors along one wall will allow the space to be either closed off for quiet work time or opened up into the adjacent living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="staining-hardwood-during-renovation" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48004 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-4.jpg" alt="staining hardwood and creating pattern with tapes in a nook during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We stumbled upon this wood stain sample palette inside a large closet near the master bedroom. When staining existing wood floors, Gideon&#8217;s team makes samples on site before making final decisions, to ensure that their clients get exactly what they want. After decisions are made, the samples are re-sanded and final staining takes place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Qian told us that she really appreciated that the designers are perfectionists; when it came to staining her floors, she said, &#8220;Gideon asked the contractor to try three different stains for us to look at. We all really liked the darkest stain, but Gideon thought some of the reddish undertones were still coming out and he wanted them to try another coat even if it would mean adding on an extra day to stain the floors.&#8221; In the end, that extra coat (the swatch on the bottom left) is the stain they chose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="tile-installation-in-bathroom" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48002 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2.jpg" alt="bathtub and wall and floor tiles installation in a bathroom during renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MendelesonGroup-UWS-2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ended our visit in the master bathroom which, like the kitchen, is getting a full material upgrade. The finished bath will be adorned in marble &#8212; herringbone floor in honed Paper White and polished Statuary marbles, polished Dolomiti marble tiles on the walls, and  polished Bardiglio surfaces for the vanity top and tub deck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We cannot wait to see this renovation finish up &#8212; many thanks to Gideon, Sara &amp; the Mendelson Group team for sharing!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-30927" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN Yityng-Closet-WineBar" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Yityng-Closet-WineBar.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>This week we stopped in to see a finished project that was awarded to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. The homeowners converted their under-stair closet space into a personal wine bar in an apartment on the Upper West Side. The new bar-topped niche is the perfect place to store and display the couples&#8217; wine collection, and it also doubles as a breakfast bar, making it an expansion of their small galley kitchen. Happy with their new space, the homeowners told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our contractor was very professional, contactable (important!), and has great suggestions. [We] would definitely recommend his team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the project from start to finish.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19539" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-01" width="600" height="804" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-01-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is the photo the homeowners included when <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project to Sweeten</a> showing their double-door, under-stair closet space. The closet would be just the right fit for a wine cooler, cabinet, and wall-mounted shelving.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19540" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png" alt="sweeten_winebar-before-02" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-before-02-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The couple already had some ideas in mind for wood shelving. Here are some of their inspiration images which they also posted to their project on Sweeten.</p>
<p><span id="more-5187"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19544" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The work began last month when their contractor cleared out the space, giving it smooth walls, fresh paint, and wired new lighting for the bar.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19542" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-during-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-during-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The next step was to assemble and install the small cabinet and wine-cooler. The homeowners chose this cabinet from the <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martha Stewart</a> collection available at Home Depot the style is Weston in Persian Grey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19546 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-02" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-02-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19553 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-01" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-01-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the finished view &#8211;we love the clever use of space! As well as the pop of color added by the red Tabouret stools, available on <a href="https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Tabouret-24-inch-Red-Metal-Counter-Stools-Set-of-2/5095629/product.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Overstock</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19547" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-03" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-03-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The homeowners chose an elegant bartop in Carrara marble, also available through <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Kitchen-Countertops-Backsplashes-Countertop-Samples/Stonemark-Granite/N-5yc1vZc3boZb0i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>. Above, wine bottles are displayed on reclaimed wood shelving from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">West Elm</a>. The homeowners told us that they opted against custom shelving when they found these attractive shelves for such a great price. However, their contractor pointed out that the iron shelf brackets are a perfect match to the apartment&#8217;s stair railing—so, in the end, these off-the-shelf shelves actually appear customized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19548" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-04" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-04-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>New lamps with dimmers were also added. We love the hand-blown look of the pendants, similar to this glass pendant available at <a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/clift-seeded-glass-pendant/?pkey=cchandeliers-pendants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Barn</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19549" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg" alt="sweeten_winebar-after-05" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_winebar-after-05-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes we forget how essential our storage is &#8211;they&#8217;ve got just enough cabinet space to keep the niche looking clean and stylish, with all the extras stowed away.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to the homeowners for sharing their awesome new wine bar!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re catching up with another one of our new GC&#8217;s &#8212;<a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nick Knacks Creative Interiors</a> is a husband-wife team lead by Nick &amp; Dawn Dillon. The homeowners (a pair of young, newly-wed professionals) chose Nick Knacks after interviewing 7 other contractors for this project which included renovating both a master (full) bath and a half bath in their Upper West Side home. Nick has a knack for details, so we&#8217;ve broken down the nitty-gritty on just the master bath makeover.</p>

Nick&#8217;s design featured classic white beveled-edge subway tiles and <a href="https://store.benjaminmoore.com/storefront/shop-by-product/interior-paints/aura-interior-paint/prodPRM24.html?sbcColor=2033_70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Moore&#8217;s Aura Sweet Honeydew Melon</a> on the walls, as well as framed inset medicine cabinets from <a href="https://rh.com/catalog/category/products.jsp?link=MedicineCabinets&amp;categoryId=cat1520041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restoration Hardware</a>, and a new granite top for the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3505" title="nickknacks_03" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_031-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>When it came to the bathroom cabinets, Nick worked closely with these homeowners to come up with a custom solution that was &#8220;exactly it.&#8221; Nick did the design, fabrication, installation and wood staining of the double sink base cabinet (above) as well as a floating sink base and vertical storage cabinets in the half bath. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3500" title="nickknacks_04" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_041-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>Nick&#8217;s eye for details is also found in the finish of the window sill and tub ledge where he matched the granite used on the vanity. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3501" title="nickknacks_05" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg" alt="" width="486" height="320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051.jpg 486w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nickknacks_051-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></a>He also chose lighting and bath fixtures in polished chrome, including faucet and shower fittings from the <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/Collections-Purist/category/430068/430062.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler Purist Collection</a>. The floors and tub side were tiled with these unglazed porcelain in <a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/72620612710977408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linosa by Basaltina</a>.</p>
<p>Nick says that the homeowners were so pleased with the bathrooms that they added a custom bedroom closet to the scope of the original project. Great work and many thanks to Nick &amp; Dawn!</p>
