<h3>Improve layout and impersonal lighting</h3>
<p>The kitchen in Dawn and David’s loft apartment was not ideally configured. After living in the home for a dozen years, the pair decided to finally redo the kitchen. The cabinets had seen a lot of wear and tear, and appliances and drawers were not in the best positions.</p>
<p>The couple also wanted to fix a prior renovat<span style="color: #333333;">ion mistake:</span> a contractor had convinced them to go with recessed lighting in the kitchen and living room areas. Dawn found the choice too commercial and wanted to find statement pendants with a bit more character. The couple also wanted to add personal touches, like a Moroccan-style tile backsplash.</p>
<h3>Make the kitchen&#8217;s storage function smarter</h3>
<p>The goal was to borrow square footage from the kitchen to give more breathing room to the dining and living room areas. They&#8217;d create more kitchen counter space and cabinet storage but within a smaller footprint. An efficient layout would be key. She said, “We wanted to get the most out of each nook and cranny while not ending up with a lot of nooks and crannies!”</p>
<p>Given their penchant for entertaining, large serving pieces and other odd-shaped items needed specific spots. To accomplish this, Dawn “spent a lot of time measuring the things that&#8217;d go into storage and were plotted out correctly in the kitchen. I was careful not to over-allocate space.”</p>

<p>An expanded <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula with drawers</a> on either side—facing the kitchen as well as the entryway—was a key part of executing this vision. Dawn wanted “tons of room for prepping and cooking a meal as well as serving space for hors d&#8217;oeuvres when we entertain. People like to congregate in the kitchen when they arrive. I wanted to have a space that didn’t interfere with the process of making dinner. With a much bigger peninsula, we confine the prep/cooking work to one half of the surface while making room for an attractive presentation on the other.”</p>

<h3>Focal point: A yellow Moroccan tile backsplash</h3>
<p>They created dedicated space for serving trays and her largest pots. A good deal of thought went into the best placement of appliances and cabinets; the utensil drawer faces the dishwasher, while the speed oven is hidden in the peninsula keeping the countertops clear.</p>
<p>Dawn also worked with her Sweeten contractor to add a full-length pantry that had both interior drawers and shelves. A <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/clean-and-organize/creative-spice-storage-ideas-pictures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spice rack mounted</a> at eye level sits inside of the door.</p>
<p>For the finishes, Dawn, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://arcadiahomeinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arcadia Home</a>, an artisan-made home accessories brand, had a vision: “grainy flat-paneled cabinets, beautiful organic pulls, extraordinary color in the backsplash, killer lighting, and a fairly clean white but interesting countertop.”</p>

Now, the peninsula sports two handmade pierced nickel-plated brass shades from Egypt. The light from the pierced holes creates a unique pattern when illuminated. The centerpiece of the entire kitchen was the yellow Moroccan tile, inspired by a yellow Moroccan rug in the couple’s living room—a purchase from their first trip together during their dating days. “It makes us happy every day,” she said.</p>

<h3>Changing the entire floor plan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our apartment, which was built in 1912, had almost all of the original details still intact. It was important for us to keep this character while adding a more usable kitchen and bathroom. The first objective was to get rid of the long hallway, which was tying up roughly 10% of the apartment. An added bonus: opening up the floor plan would bring more light in.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34515 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg" alt="Park Slope homeowners Laura and Walter" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<div></div>
<h3>A new angle for the kitchen</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, we wanted to expand the footprint of the kitchen. ­The existing layout was <em>not</em> working: it was impossible to open the oven door without running into the sink. It was also difficult for more than one person to be in the space at a time. Everyone wound up standing in the doorway to the kitchen. We posted our Park Slope apartment gut renovation on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> and got to work with our contractor.</p>

<blockquote><p>Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, the original kitchen and center bedroom were swapped. The apartment layout included a small angled section of wall in the center bedroom—now our kitchen. Enter our Sweeten contractor, who had this idea when he came to our apartment for the initial meeting. It was one of the primary reasons we decided to work with him. His instinct was to embrace this angle and open up the new kitchen more than the traditional 90-degree corner would allow. We lost a bit of floor space in our bedroom as a result, but the tradeoff was worth it.</p>
<p>We were able to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include both a peninsula</a> and a dining nook in the new spacious layout. A bookshelf fits at the end of the peninsula closest to the living room.</p>

<h3>Custom built-in cabinets are key</h3>
<p>Given that we wanted to squeeze five rooms and a bathroom out of our apartment, it was important that every room was laid out as efficiently as possible. The various <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built­-ins we added</a> allowed us to accomplish just that.</p>
<p>The built-in cabinets around the dining nook and drawers under the seating bench hide a ton of additional storage. Coming from our narrow galley kitchen, we were really excited to have a space big enough for us and our friends to hang out and cook in.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34497 mb-0 size-full" title="white-and-blue-kitchen-cabinets" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-27.gif" alt="white and blue kitchen cabinets with breakfast nook and built in bench after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above the foyer, we dropped the ceiling by 18” for built-in cabinets. The result is nearly 30 square feet of additional storage space. Lowering the ceiling had the added benefit of the apartment drawing you in. It made the rest of the apartment feel spacious by comparison—a design trick inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #333333;">The den&#8217;s millwork could fit a full-size bed for the future.</span> </span>In our bedroom, the closets around the bed double as nightstands with­ the upper drawers on each side containing a hidden outlet.</p>

<h3>Choosing materials</h3>
<p>The footprint of our bathroom couldn&#8217;t be enlarged because of the location of the windows and the building plumbing. In order to maximize the space, we opted for a shorter tub to fit under the window, a wall-mounted toilet to free up floor space, and a wall-mounted faucet, which gives more counters space around the sink.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg" alt="bathroom tub" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34511 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-06-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Our goal was to use natural materials as much as possible. The oak floors were a tribute to the original parquet floors (we tried to save them, but they were too thin for another sanding). We designed and cast our own concrete sink (in a small rented workshop in Industry City) to fit perfectly. The subway tiles in the kitchen and bathroom were handmade, as were the dining nook pendants—all adding subtle character and texture to the spaces. We opted for a marbled quartz countertop and think it will last much better than the real thing.</p>
<h3>Renovation tip: Order materials early</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of unexpected situations arose: an old dumbwaiter shaft ran through our proposed kitchen, the floor joists needed replacing, and the gas pipe had to be re­run from the basement passing through three other apartments. In retrospect, none of these things should have been surprising in an old building. Our Sweeten contractor was with us every step of the way to modify our plans to deal with the unexpected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My best tip for future renovators is to have all the fixtures with long lead times and finishes ordered before the work begins. Nothing pushes back a project deadline like waiting for materials or having all work stop because the tiles are still on the truck.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg" alt="glass partition" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34504 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-11-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-02.gif" alt="glass wall partition" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-34500 size-full" /></p>
<p>In the end, we were able to keep the things we loved most about our original apartment while making significant improvements to our home for now and in the future. There are so many things we can enjoy now. The kitchen has become the center of our apartment, with friends able to hang out in the dining nook or living room while still being part of the conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The glass partition helps bring a ton of light into the apartment. The bathroom has gone from tight-for­-one to comfortable-­for­-two. We were very lucky to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find a partner in our Sweeten contractor</a>. After living in the completed apartment, we’ve yet to find anything we’d change.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the northwest side of Brooklyn’s famous Prospect Park lies the family-friendly neighborhood Park Slope. The enclave offers the best of both worlds: commercial streets of boutiques, casual restaurants, and bars, plus quiet pockets of greenery, brownstones, and apartment buildings. Its inventory of older homes and popularity among young professionals and families has also made it one of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten’s</a> top renovating neighborhoods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3>A one-wall kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kitchen-remodel-in-park-slope.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel in park slope with blue cabinets and herringbone backsplash" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58100 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kitchen-remodel-in-park-slope.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kitchen-remodel-in-park-slope-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kitchen-remodel-in-park-slope-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten homeowners Tiffany and Chad adore Brooklyn, especially Park Slope. Wanting to design their dream home, they decided to manage <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/two-tone-blue-and-white-kitchen-has-first-class-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their own kitchen renovation project</a> to save money. The original cookspace occupied a corner spot, but the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new kitchen plan</a> entailed a single-wall layout opening up to the living area. Dual-color blue and white cabinets and reclaimed floating shelves gave them the country and industrial vibes they were looking for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Sweeten, they found a contractor in Park Slope who fit their budget. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-renovation-bids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bidding and estimating process</a> was made seamless and easy. The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision to transform their space</a> was definitely the right one and their first apartment feels much more like home.</span></p>
<h3>A functional railroad-style floorplan</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/railroad-apartment-in-park-slope.jpg" alt="railroad condo in park slope" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58101 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/railroad-apartment-in-park-slope.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/railroad-apartment-in-park-slope-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/railroad-apartment-in-park-slope-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Lavanya and Regis persisted in their home search before discovering the Park Slope <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condo with a railroad-style layout</a>. The long, skinny apartment provided a private office space for Lavanya, while still maintaining the boundaries between WFH and home life. They enlisted the assistance of a Sweeten contractor to bring their unique home vision to life. The six-month renovation spanned multiple rooms, allowing for a rearrangement and modernization of the condo&#8217;s layout, including the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom closet.</p>
<p>The contractor ensured the electrical system was up to code, installed solid oak wood floors, and even <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/add-washer-dryer-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facilitated the addition of a washer and dryer</a>. In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact with the contractor</a> throughout the renovation process, the contractor offered cost-effective alternatives and kept Lavanya at ease when unexpected delays and expenses arose.</p>
<h3>Updated bathroom in black and white</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bathroom-remodel-in-park-slope-1.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel in park slope with white and black finishes" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-58099 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bathroom-remodel-in-park-slope-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bathroom-remodel-in-park-slope-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bathroom-remodel-in-park-slope-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/bathroom-remodel-uber-chic-bathroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie and Lance&#8217;s bathroom remodel</a> in their Park Slope condo was sparked by water leaking into their bedroom closet. In <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting the bathroom process</a>, they found a general contractor through Sweeten to update the entire space both functionally and aesthetically.</p>
<p>Initially, the couple hoped to remove the glass partition between the shower and toilet. However, advised of a high likelihood for more water damage, they agreed to a more sturdy version with an elegant black trim. The new round mirrors, faucets, and fixtures all echo the black rim theme. Despite working within a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realistic budget for the bathroom</a>, living in the apartment during construction proved challenging for the family of three. But, effective communication and a diligent contractor moved progress toward completion.</p>
<h3>A blue bath in a two-bed convertible</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40139" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg" alt="bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Katherine-Fell-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they were looking for a new apartment for their growing family, Katherine and Chris took their search to Park Slope. The neighborhood had excellent schools and proximity to his parents, a win-win. Finding the right </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">three-bedroom apartment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (at the right price) proved a little more challenging than the decision to focus their hunt there. Once they <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/two-bedroom-conversion-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a convertible two-bedroom</a>, the family got to work with a Sweeten general contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut their bathroom</a>, move the kitchen, and create the third bedroom they had been wanting.</span></p>
<h3>Clever storage ideas</h3>

Inspired by design tricks from her native Italy, she focused on <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a colorful home</a> with plenty of style and storage to spare. From the above-sink dishrack in the kitchen to the window bench in the living room, Giulia embraced the best of classic brownstone architecture while creating a modern and liveable space.</span></p>
<h3>A unique layout makes sense</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34489 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14.jpg" alt="Park Slope renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-LauraWalterParkinson-Apt-14-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Like so many buildings and apartments across New York City, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-brooklyn-couple-slays-the-storage-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura and Walter’s co-op</a> was nearing a century old. They hit the real estate jackpot though in that many of the Park Slope home’s original details remained intact. To <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-northeast/how-to-remodel-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin the progression in the apartment</a> and plan for a bigger kitchen with a floorplan more suited to their lifestyle, they swapped the location of the original kitchen and a bedroom. Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home renovation budget and planning</a> resulted in fitting five separate rooms in just 700 square feet.</p>

<h3>Open sight lines for a kitchen</h3>

Separated from the dining and living space with walls, she opted to make the kitchen part of an <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/park-slope-kitchen-remodel-navy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-concept arrangement</a>. With a Sweeten contractor and a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good handle on the remodeling costs</a>, they turned the more standard layout of older apartments into a space fit for entertaining, relaxing, and cooking.</p>
<h3>Renovating as an investment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29851 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt had been renting an alcove studio in Park Slope for two years before he decided to purchase his first home in the same neighborhood. He lived with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pink-tiled bathroom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for four years before deciding to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/an-old-bath-gets-investment-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renovate the bathroom</a> investing in the apartment&#8217;s value. While he stuck to the floor plan, his Sweeten contractor did <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/how-to-convert-bathtub-into-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace the bathtub</a> for a new walk-in shower, which Matt enjoyed much more.</span></p>
<h3>Finally finding a home</h3>

They planned to renovate before moving in, with a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/replacing-wood-floors-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on redoing the uneven floors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and gutting the bathroom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to a lack of subflooring, the floors needed more work than expected, but the end result was well worth it.</span></p>

Ditch a clunky layout. Add a kitchen island. And do it before the baby arrives. Those were Tara and Brian’s four main renovation goals after they bought a two-bedroom co-op (with a small office space) in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The prewar apartment was an upgrade in space and number of bedrooms from their previous rental as the couple prepared to start a family.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40338 mt-24 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-14-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40323 size-full" title="kitchen before renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg" alt="kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>However, it was outdated. Oak cabinets in the kitchen and patterned tiles in the bathroom, all from the &#8217;90s, made the room feel old. A kitchen peninsula awkwardly dissected the eating area and living room. The fridge took up prime real estate, blocking light from the apartment’s rear. “The previous owners had lived there for eight years and hadn’t really updated it,” Tara said. They decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted contractors, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/meet-the-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose a general contractor.</a></p>
<p>The couple decided to do most of the renovation before moving in so Tara, who was pregnant at the time, wouldn’t inhale any dust. Once the water was connected and the messy work complete, Brian and Tara took up residence while their contractor worked around them.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40337 size-full" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg" alt="kitchen island" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40326 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg" alt="kitchen storage and integrated refrigerator" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>For Tara, adding that <span style="color: #333333;">kitchen</span> island was non-negotiable and it turned out to be one of the crowning glories of the renovation. Their contractor had a reclaimed wood supplier in Pennsylvania and the couple picked out a big slab of walnut. They went for a rustic look, leaving two sides with a live edge and enhanced the wood’s cherry red tone with a lacquer. “<span style="color: #333333;">I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said, adding that now when they have friends over, that still proves true.</span></p>
<p>Their contractor suggested a workaround for the refrigerator. The area already had three big clunky closets across from the main kitchen. Why not match those closets to the new cabinets in the kitchen and hide the fridge in there? It turned into a perfect solution that helped the flow of space between the living room, kitchen and the back of the apartment.</p>

The new kitchen layout had a few feet of wall space that wasn’t serving any purpose other than be covered in the white subway tiles Brian and Tara picked for their backsplash. The contractor saw the potential for a small pantry. When it’s shut, it looks like a tiled wall. But pop the magnetic doors open, and a 10-inch deep cabinet is revealed. “<span style="color: #333333;">It’s a shallow pantry, but it is enormously useful,</span>” said Tara. “Our friends think it is so cool.”</p>
<p>To create a sense of openness in the kitchen, Tara and Brian ditched the cabinets above the counter <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-shelves-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of open shelving</a>. Their contractor used the walnut from the new kitchen island to create the shelving. The red proved the perfect accent of color and texture to the couple’s color palette of black and white.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQtbfhBsVrk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="behind-the-video-image" class="alignnone wp-image-40850 mb-0 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg" alt="image of behind the reno video" width="975" height="193" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia.jpg 975w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-300x59.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/QA-MOV-Link-BehindReno-EdAlicia-600x119.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>Sticking closely to that color scheme, Tara wanted a darker stain with a matte finish on the wood floors. Brian thought it needed more gloss. “We spent a lot of time figuring out what stain to use,” Tara said. “My husband eventually came around.”</p>

Of everything in the renovation, making a decision on what <span style="color: #333333;">bathroom</span> faucets to install took the most time. Tara wanted something modern and functional. Brian had a strong view that it should have one handle instead of two. In the end, they found something “that we both didn’t hate,” Tara said.</p>
<p>She also felt strongly in favor of a glass partition rather than a shower curtain, “to make the space look bigger.” Brian pointed out the difficulties of maneuvering around a partial glass barrier when bathing their soon-to-arrive infant. To get on the same page on the glass, Tara volunteered to take the lead on baby bathing responsibilities. “At the moment she is still getting washed in the kitchen sink because it is so big,” she said.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">If we thought creatively, we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The renovation hit a snag when their general contractor uncovered some serious water damage to the bathroom flooring. The couple had planned on keeping the original bathtub since they thought it was in pretty good shape. This new discovery meant they needed a new one. On the bright side, it gave Tara the chance to cross something off her “want” list: a bath with a tiled side.  “<span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor was very upfront with what was needed and what the cost would be,” Tara said, of the mid-project pivot. “He gave us options of what to do about it.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40331 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg" alt="study" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The walnut wood turned into the gift that kept giving. After completing the kitchen, their contractor used the remainder to create three small shelves in the bathroom. With some wood still unused, he carved up more shelves for the <span style="color: #333333;">office</span>.</p>
<p>The renovation took three months to complete. During the project, Brian and Tara communicated often with their Sweeten contractor via text message and in person. “He was so great because we would text with him and he would keep us up-to-date even on minor details,” Tara said.</p>
<p>The couple also learned the art of compromise during the process. “Brian had to remind me of what was practical even if I really wanted something,” Tara said. But at the same time, don’t be afraid to get creative, she advised. The secret pantry behind a tiled wall and walnut shelving in the bathroom are two examples of making inspired decisions on the go. “<span style="color: #333333;">We realized if we thought creatively,” said Tara, “we could make the most of all the space that would otherwise have gone unused.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First-time Brooklyn renovators learn a few lessons after replacing the wood floors in their home</h2>
<p><em>After nearly a decade of bouncing from one New York apartment to another, Katie, Marcus, and their pup, Squib, were ready to put down roots. They purchased a 750-square-foot Park Slope co-op knowing they would renovate right away and before moving in. They closed in April and had a move-in date of May 31; any renovation had to go quickly. But they were optimistic because the apartment was in great shape, and other than replacing the floors and updating the bathroom, there wasn’t anything major that needed doing–or so they thought. Floors, it turns out, can be a tricky challenge. They posted <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten </a>to find a vetted general contractor. Between <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Sweeten contractor</a> and Client Service&#8217;s help, Katie, Marcus, and Squib can now stand on stable ground.</em></p>

<p>Before we did our final walk-through, we had only visited our apartment once at the open house. In our home search, we had developed a pretty thorough checklist of what to look for at every apartment we visited: “Were bathrooms properly ventilated?” “Did windows need replacing?” “Were the floors even?” In this apartment, which was probably built in the 1920s, the wood floors were uneven and noisy. We knew we’d have to replace them, and it would be easier to do so before moving in. Since we were going to be redoing the floors, we figured we might as well redo the bathroom as it&#8217;s hard to live without one in a one-bath apartment! It wasn’t in bad shape, it was just a bit out of date and not our style.</p>

<p>Settling on an overall style was a bit of a challenge as Marcus likes deep, rich colors and lots of décor, and I tend to like bright, clean spaces with straight lines and pops of color or contrast. Right off the bat, we had to figure out our combined vision for the space so we wouldn&#8217;t argue over every little thing.</p>

<p>Other than that, our first big challenge came when the contractor began to rip up the floorboards. There was no subfloor. There was nothing but air between our old floorboards and the ceiling of the apartment below. No wonder it had been so noisy!</p>
<p>Since the building was old, there was the added challenge of trying to re-level an apartment where everything had been built or altered for a dramatically uneven floor. We weren&#8217;t able to get it completely level. There’s even a section of brick wall underneath part of our bedroom floor. From what? We’ll never really know. The floor is still noticeably uneven in parts, and we&#8217;ve had to get levelers for most of our furniture, but it’s much better than when we started.</p>
<p>We wanted a wood floor that would bring some warmth to our home and be durable for years of Squib running back and forth over it. We selected red oak because I love how it warms up the space, and plays off the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-homes-discover-the-raw-appeal-of-exposed-brick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exposed brick</a> of the fireplace. Our contractor was helpful in guiding us to a good stain and style of baseboards. (There weren’t any baseboards originally, but we liked having something to transition from the wall to the floor.) We also did do a bit of <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/soundproofing-your-home-from-acoustic-panels-to-insulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soundproofing under the floors</a>.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, we replaced the water-damaged wood floor with slate tile which we felt would be more durable. It&#8217;s not a large space, and we’ll probably update our kitchen at some point, so we kept the tile neutral.</p>

<p>The bathroom was our main project focus. We wanted something simple and crisp. It&#8217;s not a huge bathroom and we didn&#8217;t want to overwhelm the space. We chose a classic white subway tile for the walls and slate tile for the floor. While I love the look of a honeycomb floor tile, it’s too hard to keep clean and grime-free. To break up the subway tile, we added a little black edging under the chair rail. Thankfully our contractor had done something similar on a previous job so we were able to see an example of it before committing!</p>
<p>We also wanted to maximize storage in the bathroom. We kept a wall cabinet in its place and repainted it. Our contractor built a little nook in the shower, which we hadn’t even thought of, but ended up loving! The storage under the sink wasn’t useful because of the pipes. We compensated by including a large medicine cabinet.</p>

<p>One thing we didn’t anticipate was how hard it would be to find a sink without faucet holes. Since our faucet comes out of the wall, almost every sink without pre-made faucet holes had to be specially made. As a result, our sink didn&#8217;t arrive until after we moved in, and we had to settle for a vanity with drawers that weren&#8217;t compatible with our plumbing.</p>
<p>We are in the process of having a friend modify it so we can actually utilize that space. Here’s a tip: vanities are unbelievably expensive and you can really only use the Ikea vanities with Ikea sinks, or it will take a lot of modification to make it work. Listen to your husband when he tells you that.</p>
<p>But live and learn. This was our first ever renovation. In the span of seven weeks, we closed on our apartment, renovated, moved, and started working 14-hour days. We also got married in the middle of all this! It was so hard to source things in a timely manner and, instead of having fun looking at lighting or tile or paint colors, we just wanted everything done so we could stop making choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38263 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-723x482.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, bedroom" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5866.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The high-speed ride led to fun miscommunications like me accidentally telling the painters to paint both bedrooms deep teal because I actually forgot that we had two bedrooms and told them to “paint the bedroom teal.” Looks like we have a painting project ahead of us.</p>
<p>Our contractor was somehow able to complete the majority of the work in our accelerated time frame even after laying a new subfloor for the whole apartment. He was very communicative and offered great tips and guidance on what would look better or last longer in the space. He was clear about what was happening at every step of the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38264 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dog" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-723x1085.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, pet" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5890.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The people at the Sweeten office, too, checked in with us throughout the process to ensure that everything was going smoothly. The Sweeten blog was helpful for finding design inspiration and sources when the full scope of products available on the internet proved overwhelming. The Sweeten cost guides helped us create a budget.</p>
<p>We realized afterward that it would be great to have two budgets, an “on paper this is what we want to spend&#8221; budget and a &#8220;we cannot afford to go over this number&#8221; budget. That way you can assess what will be worth the money and what you can scale back on if something comes up. Start sourcing things early, if possible. It&#8217;s better to get the thing you want early and move it around your living room for a few weeks then to not get what you want because it won&#8217;t arrive in time.</p>
<p>We were excited to finally have our own space to make our own! I grew up on the campus of a boarding school so I had never been able to paint my walls before, let alone really personalize a space. We love our apartment so much and are so happy with everything. The bathroom turned out perfectly and the floors are much more beautiful and practical than the original ones we started with.</p>
<p>Like every homeowner, we have many more projects that we will eventually want to do, but I&#8217;m happy we started with just the flooring and the bathroom so we didn&#8217;t bite off more than we could handle with our first apartment purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A first-time homeowner mixes sustainability with the comforts of her native country</h2>
<p><em>Giulia renovated her one-bedroom apartment in a 1920s brownstone co-op in Park Slope <span style="color: #000000;">soon after she purchased it, and </span>before she moved out of her Lower East Side rental. She developed the design herself for the 500-square-foot home and posted her project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a general contractor. The space desperately needed updating and some major space planning. While Giulia, who is from Italy, was able to bring in lots of </em>color<em>, European style, and ideas from her home country, maximizing storage was her main goal. Here’s how she did it.</em></p>

<em>Guest blog post by homeowner Giulia in Park Slope</em></p>
<p>My vision for the space was a large and happy living room, a functional kitchen, and a comfortable bathroom. The whole apartment really needed a lot of updating; the appliances and fixtures were very old in the kitchen and bathroom, and there was so little storage space. I really like mid-century style and lots of color on a white background. The place had big, “old” character in its window and door moldings, fireplace, and wood floor. To find a good balance, I added clean, modern elements like the hexagonal tiles and almost-invisible closet doors.</p>

<p>Given <span style="color: #000000;">my occupation in researching energy savings in the home</span> and my interest in sustainable buildings, I included a few items that could be considered environmentally green:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-flow plumbing fixtures in the bathroom and kitchen; the toilet is a 0.8 gpf, the lowest flow rate available on the market</li>
<li>Zero VOC paints for walls and moldings (Natura by Benjamin Moore)</li>
<li>Low VOC adhesives and sealants throughout</li>
<li>LED-compatible lighting fixtures and LED bulbs throughout</li>
</ul>
<p>Since storage was a priority, I looked for spaces where I could incorporate cabinetry. Right away, I saw the <span style="color: #000000;">living room </span>bay windows scream, “Window bench!” I might have seen this kind of design element in a movie when I was growing up. I never thought I would have one for myself; I was so excited. The bay was also a good spot for a big, round dinner table.</p>

The size of the interiors was perfect for big-volume items. On the ends of the window seat, I included two small cubbies to show decorative objects, small plants, and books.</p>

<p>The original <span style="color: #000000;">kitchen</span> had a lot of unused space: just a tiny stove and a few cabinets, and the uppers didn’t even go to the ceiling. The materials—linoleum flooring, cheap tiles, and low-quality cabinets and countertop—weren’t in good condition.</p>

<p>We removed a small soffit to maximize the area. For the upper area, I wanted a mix of open shelves and cabinets. Too many closed cabinets would suffocate the space. Plus, the open shelves “solved” the corner issue and helped avoid weird, L-shaped upper cabinets. I love the contrast of the blue and white oak. I had the same colors in my bedroom in Rome when I was a kid and I think it just reminded me of home. I included two wooden cubbies above the fridge and the hood to break the continuity of the <span style="color: #000000;">blue</span> and make the design more dynamic. The backsplash is a subway tile in an inverted concave design to add more movement to the space.</p>

<p>Above the sink is a drying rack shelf, a trick I stole from my home country. Wet dishes drip off directly into the sink, avoiding puddles of standing water on the counter. Also, I don’t need to use any of my limited counter space to dry my dishes. For the lower cabinets, I maximized the space and the corners with “hinged” foldout doors which would allow me to have access to the full space underneath the sink.</p>
<p>I designed a tall closet as part of the kitchen storage for my broom, vacuum, and cleaning supplies. I found it funny as the last thing anyone would want to think about when moving into a new place is, “Where do I put this tall broom?”</p>

<p>Since the <span style="color: #000000;">bathroom</span> and the kitchen are next to each other, I pictured their floors similar but not identical. I chose the same material and shape—hexagonal cement tiles—but different colors. In the kitchen, I wanted a more neutral color given the strong character of the blue cabinets, so I went for a light gray. In the bathroom, I got a bit more creative, picking a “3D-look” pattern, with yellow, white and gray.</p>
<p>The bathroom had space issues as well: A small tub took up much of the room, preventing me from having a nice, big sink. The pink fixtures had a kind of pretty, “vintage” look, but they needed to be modernized and replaced with something new and more functional.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37966 mb-0 size-full" title="bathroom sink " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-11-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t love bathtubs, especially if they are small and tight; I would rather have a big and comfortable shower, instead! So I designed a rectangular shower, which would be shorter than the tub—leaving more space for the sink—but still bigger than a traditional shower stall.</p>
<p>A shower door would have eaten up space, so I opted for a rectangular opening and no door. To keep the water inside the glass walls, I chose a “rain-effect” showerhead. (The rod next to the showerhead is a bracket that holds the glass wall in place.)</p>
<p>My original idea for the floor was to have an “infinite shower” with a sloped floor and no threshold. This wasn’t going to work, so I had to include the white flexible rubber threshold glued to the floor tiles to keep the water in. (Not the best in terms of looks, but it works!) I attached a hand-held bidet to the toilet—another “European” detail of mine. I also repurposed a mini desk from West Elm as a sink vanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37969 size-full" title="floor plan " src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg" alt="floorplan" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-Floorplan-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><br />
<em>(Above)</em> Floor plan of bedroom and closet</p>
<p>Another storage puzzle was my <span style="color: #000000;">bedroom</span> closet, the one and only closet in the apartment. It was small and sat next to the bedroom door. That wall was also the only spot where I could put some type of dresser or wardrobe to store my clothes. I decided to close up the closet side in the bedroom and have it open from its short-side located in the hallway instead. I installed a telescopic rod that can be pulled straight out for clothes to be hung on it. For additional storage, there are shelves above the closet and a deep drawer below, where I keep bags.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37956 mb-0 size-full" title="closet" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Giulia-Luci-Apt-01.gif" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, home, renovation, closet" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>I left the original wood flooring in the <span style="color: #000000;">living room and bedroom</span>. I had it laminated and stained with a gray finish to maintain the color and avoid any gold and red shades. We did a lot of testing before finding the perfect balance of gray and wood.</p>
<p>The countertop and shelves in the kitchen and the tops of the bay window bench are all made of white oak. I really like this finish and the way it contrasts with the white of the walls. Also, it’s a pretty resistant material, good for these kinds of applications.</p>
<p>Designing my apartment was fun and exciting but challenging. I had to learn how to make decisions very quickly every day. The six months of renovating were some of the most difficult months of my life; I’m pretty happy it’s over! My friends have been a huge help throughout the entire process; I’m very lucky I have them. Sweeten, too, was helpful as I was wrapping everything up.</p>
<p>I learned so much throughout the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for much more time than is estimated</li>
<li>When possible, choose simple design ideas</li>
<li>Do the work all at once—don’t split the job into pieces</li>
<li>Clarify details with the contractor prior to starting the job</li>
<li>Understand what’s included in your budget and what’s a change order</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I’m so happy living in my newly renovated space, and my friends all like it, too.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Giulia. We hope you love your new first home!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Create a more functional kitchen in Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The Park Slope, Brooklyn, homeowner bought her apartment in 2008 knowing it had good bones, great outdoor space (a total score in NYC!), and loads of untapped potential. She’d already renovated the backyard and bathroom before deciding to take on the kitchen, which didn’t have an ideal flow for cooking or entertaining. A wall dividing the kitchen from the living and dining room contained a coat closet taking up valuable space. Armed with ideas on how to make it more practical for storage and cooking,  she <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21389#before" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project on Sweeten</a>. “I had seen the blog, before-and-after pictures, and write-ups, and thought, &#8216;this is exactly what I need,&#8217;” she said.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: She was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/admin/projects/21389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a> who created 2D and 3D sketches to help her envision the space. They knocked down the walls between the kitchen, dining room, and living room, in addition to removing an overhang (made only of drywall) that made the kitchen feel smaller. All appliances stayed in place except for the refrigerator, which moved to the wall opposite the stove. On her wish list was a place to store cookbooks, a mixer, a ladder, and coats (since the closet was now gone). Her Sweeten contractor doubled the storage with a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-peninsula-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peninsula,</a> plus a wall of cabinets surrounding the refrigerator. “My contractor listened to all of my ideas and my wish list, which grew on a daily basis, and incorporated it all into her design seamlessly,” she said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The homeowner and contractor worked together to choose finishes. “When it came to picking a kitchen sink faucet, I went down the rabbit hole of researching it on my own, going to showrooms, and looking at different faucets, I realized the original one my contractor recommended was actually the best of them all.” she admitted. The navy-and-white cabinets, paired with gold hardware, gave the kitchen a classic and contemporary touch.</p>

<p><em>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Aimee</em></p>
<h3>Remodeling a brownstone for the future</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My wife B and I loved our little one-bedroom duplex in Hell’s Kitchen, but it had two drawbacks. It was small and the spiral staircase was a safety hazard we suspected would only worsen as we got older. Our budget was tight for the two-bed, two-bath apartment we wanted, but we felt it was time to make the move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on Park Slope, we were outbid on two apartments: one that wasn&#8217;t perfect and another with a cute balcony. It became clear that we needed to look at apartments below our budget so we could bid higher, but there wasn’t much in that range.</p>

<h3>Finding a solution in a fixer-upper home</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I expanded my search to include places with only one bathroom, and saw an apartment pop up that fit our budget—the listing said, “Bring your contractor.” It was a big mess, but at least it was big! I rushed to an early open house on a Wednesday morning so I could be one of the first to see it. As I left, I texted B, “It needs a lot of work, but it just feels like home.” She came back with me that Sunday and was equally smitten with the place. We had to outbid 11 other offers, but this time, we got it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg" alt="Living area with window nook alcove and open door to the office" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52131 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Livingroom-18-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-bed, one-bath (now two-bath) co-op is on the 2nd floor of a brownstone building in the center of Park Slope. The bathroom was in desperate need of an update, and the kitchen was more or less non-existent (there were a few cabinets and a sink). We didn’t know if we needed an architect, a contractor, a designer, or all of the above. After speaking to a few of each, none thought they could complete the work we needed in the range of our budget. That&#8217;s when we <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/15942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project</a> on Sweeten to find a contractor who had the experience to take on the work. We were matched with a few and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired our general contractor</a>.</p>
<h3>Opting for a full-home remodel in Brooklyn</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We decided to take the plunge and do a full-home remodel on the Park Slope brownstone apartment, including installing new 5&#8243;-wide oak floors in a cherry stain, replacing crumbling plaster walls with drywall, and adding a washer/dryer in the hallway closet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg" alt="Office with black desk, book shelves, and large window" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52132 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Office-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg" alt="Living room with gray couch, gray walls, and a blue wall niche" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52130 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-LivingRoom-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We loved the sense of history in the home and wanted to save as many of the original features as possible. Some <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/crown-molding-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">molding was salvaged</a> and matched as closely as possible. The majority of the tin ceiling was saved along with the exposed brick walls and the Deco-style fireplace in our living room. The fireplace has a fresh coat of paint. Sadly, we weren’t able to save the beautiful French doors, but one now hangs horizontally on the living room wall as a piece of art.</p>

<h3>Making the space personal</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond matching the existing style, we wanted an apartment that felt cozy and creative. For me, as a writer, that meant lots of space for books. The existing small study, where one of the two doorways was removed and a transom was added, was the perfect spot for our collection. In addition, the writer in me also loved the bay window. I envisioned a banquette underneath for writing and lounging and storage as an added bonus. <span style="color: #333333;">Sitting curled up on that bench with a book is now one of my favorite activities. (Editor&#8217;s note: the owners added the banquette </span>after the photoshoot.)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen was probably the biggest transformation. The only appliance in the kitchen was a small, cheap stove that the sellers brought in for the inspection, a small sink, and a few metal cabinets. Luckily, that area needed very little demo! <span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor gave us a 3D rendering of our wishlist—a large peninsula for bar stools, ample storage space including deep drawers for our pots and pans, and the triangular configuration for our stove, sink, and fridge.</span></p>

<h3>Finding the right accents and patterns</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We tried to bring in our “cozy and creative” feel through the fixtures and furniture. Our contractor sourced most of our materials⁠, besides the lighting and appliances. As a result, this gave us more time to focus on finding the right accent pieces.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Sweeten contractor helped us to figure out the best layout in the apartment. Since we were planning to put in a second bathroom, we wanted to create an ensuite master bedroom. Consequently, we removed a wall between the two rear bedrooms so the master would be next to the large walk-in closet. That closet became the master bath. As a result, we were able to build a new clothes closet. This also enabled us to annex some hallway space.</p>

<h3>Rolling with the remodel process</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we love the end result of our new home in Brooklyn, the full home renovation process <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took a lot longer</a> than we had originally hoped. This was partly due to waiting for city permits, changes to our original plan, and the general busy schedule of our contractor. We were able to stay in our old apartment for some time because we had low carrying costs, and held off selling it as long as possible. When we finally put our old place on the market, it sold quickly and we moved into the new place with only a few weeks&#8217; notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg" alt="Light blue bedroom with a striped bed sham and Florida poster" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52119 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15942-Aimee-Bedroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Our contractor&#8217;s team got it to a “move-in ready” state in time for our move, but we realized that our idea of move-in ready differed from theirs. The floors were dry enough to put our furniture down, but none of the kitchen appliances worked. We had one functioning toilet with the only working sink in the kitchen. B and I had an interesting experience making ramen with our coffee maker and eating tuna out of a pouch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, that rough patch just made us appreciate our wonderful new kitchen and the whole apartment even more. And we still love all the little details that make this apartment uniquely ours.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Aimee and B, for sharing your cozy Park Slope brownstone remodel with us! </em></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Freshen up a worn-out bathroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: After renting an alcove studio in Park Slope for about two years, Matt, a software engineer, purchased his first home in July 2013. The 360-square-foot apartment in a neighboring co-op, built in 1950, would also become the future home of a cat named Josie, adopted in the months following the renovation. Four years passed while Matt lived in the space and saved up some money to update the outdated and decrepit bathroom. “Random pieces of tile were missing, my old sink was missing one of its support legs, and parts of the ceiling showed weakening,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I wanted a complete renovation not only to feel better about the space, but also as an investment.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.</p></blockquote>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Not knowing where to begin the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>, Matt found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and was <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with his contractor</a>. He imagined a clean and refreshing space, one with an inoffensive style that wouldn’t deter a future buyer or sublet tenant. “I love subway tile, so selecting that for the walls was an easy decision,” said Matt. Large-format charcoal gray square floor tile completes the simple backdrop for the space. A floating wood vanity injects a modern sensibility. For additional storage, a matching <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wooden cabinet</a> sits in a recessed spot on the wall opposite the vanity. And to make sure the cabinet didn’t protrude too far out, its depth was halved.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_MattCovente_Bath02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="floating-wood-vanity-under-sink" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49151 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Floating wood vanity under a white sink in a white bathroom with walk in shower and toilet after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="white-sink-brown-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49153 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="White sink with brushed nickel bathroom fixtures and a dark brown vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Matt-Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Matt intended to install a new bathtub, a tricky plumbing situation would have affected nearby apartments, so the installation was a no-go. Instead, the existing tub was transformed into a spacious walk-in shower, complete with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/shower-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corner shelves</a>, a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/glass-shower-door-small-baths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding glass door</a>, and subtly patterned floor tile. “Despite the scope change, I couldn’t be happier with the result,&#8221; he reports. &#8220;The shower is huge!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge? Living through the renovation. “For about seven weeks, my bed became my apartment. It’s where I slept, ate, read, and watched Netflix.” And while his bathroom was out of commission, Matt took advantage of the full bathroom in the building’s basement, which was newly renovated. “Each day I waddled down there with flip-flops and a shower caddy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I felt like I was back in college using the dorm’s community bathrooms.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges aside, Matt worked with Sweeten every step of the way, from project posting to completion. “Sweeten’s client services team was engaged throughout the project and made sure I had everything I needed,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They were really specific in their communication; during the bidding process I was asked how one contractor compared to another, and other questions that helped guide my decision-making.” Heading into the project, he states, &#8220;Because this was my first renovation, I was a complete novice to the process. I’m grateful for Sweeten because they gave me the confidence I needed to get started.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Matt’s advice for future first-time renovators: “Do your best to limit options for each decision, using your theme as guidance. It’s far easier to select the color of stone shower shelves from three colors instead of 10.” He also found his contractor’s input incredibly valuable, “My contractor’s best contribution was providing thoughtful, targeted material and fixture options,” which he said saved him from decision fatigue.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Ainsley and Simon moved into their two-bed, two-bath co-op in Park Slope two years ago, they already knew a kitchen renovation was on the horizon. The dark, almost menacing cabinets that touched the high ceilings made the wrong type of statement. The kitchen island also seemed disproportionately large for the space, doing a half job of making the kitchen and living room seem like two spaces. “It was hard to be in the kitchen and be a part of what was happening in the living room,” said Ainsley. “We wanted it to be more of an open, single space.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-01-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27992 " title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-01-Watermarked.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="375" height="261" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_During-01-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">    <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27990 " title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_During-01-Watermarked.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="372" height="247" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_During-01-Watermarked.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_During-01-Watermarked-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_During-01-Watermarked-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-01-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their building, circa 1892, also had some beautiful details, like the wooden trim around the windows, but dark wood features in the existing kitchen drowned everything out.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28114 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-07-1000px-RETOUCHED-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a></strong> and used <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a></strong>, a free service that connects renovators with construction professionals, to hire a <strong><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general contractor</a></strong>. After securing an architect, the couple was able to hand a set of drawings to their Sweeten contractor which made for a smooth transition process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27986 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen fridge" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Straight off the bat, their architect came up with the idea to <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/a-seamless-integrated-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hide the fridge</a></strong> inside a column that was originally thought to be structural, thus immovable. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” said Ainsley. All you see is a handle and a wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28116 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-11-1000px.RETOUCHED-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open shelving on the living room side of the kitchen island was swapped out for <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a></strong> to create a cleaner look. The height of the <strong><a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a></strong> was also dialed down to lessen the divide with the living room. The couple went with a light blue-gray to brighten up the kitchen and now the wood details &#8220;pop&#8221; as they frame the outdoor views. “Lots of grays and lots of blues,” said Ainsley. ”We went back and forth for awhile.” <a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-02-Watermarked.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27991 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Before-02-Watermarked-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-09-1000px-RETOUCHED.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28115 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen-09-1000px-RETOUCHED-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>This Park Slope co-op kitchen renovation is full of clever design details. From the <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/wheres-the-fridge-6-kitchens-with-custom-refrigerator-paneling/">paneled refrigerator</a> that blends seamlessly with the adjacent wallpapered wall, to the cutting board drawer next to the microwave. The renovation process went smoothly. Almost, anyway. A delayed material delivery caused a setback, but their Sweeten contractor worked hard to get back on schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-27987 size-chrono" title="kitchen island" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_02-03-GIF.gif" alt="kitchen renovation, Brooklyn" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: While the kitchen renovation was in progress, Simon and Ainsley stayed in the Park Slope co-op apartment. They took the opportunity to have a local culinary adventure most nights. “We went to every single restaurant in the neighborhood that we hadn’t been to,” she said.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24003 mb-0 size-full" title="Bathroom mirrors" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Bathroom mirrors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Katie_Bathroom-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/13751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bathroom remodel</a> jumpstarts after a leak is discovered</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Katie and Lance knew when they bought their Park Slope condo that their bathroom needed a new look. That bathroom remodel became urgent and more extensive when they discovered a leak in the tub with water damage spilling into their bedroom closet. “I would say to anyone buying to keep an eye out for water damage on your inspection, even if you have to move some shoes out of the closet to do it,” said Katie. With the opportunity to rethink the design, the couple, who are both actors and writers, wanted to swap out cumbersome elements such as two tiled storage vanities and a standalone pedestal sink for a sleek yet warm look.</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: The discovery of the leak meant Katie and Lance had to divide their focus and budget between aesthetics and function. They used <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors to find their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s3">general</span><span class="s3"> contractor</span></a></span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s2">got started. The couple was eyeing intricate <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor tiles</a> and a teak vanity, but the increased scope of the work meant some sacrificing elements. One thing Katie really wanted were round bathroom mirrors for “a look that was brighter and more fun than rectangle ones.” In a priority pivot, she&#8217;d originally hoped to remove the glass partition between the bath and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> but was dissuaded by the possibility of more water damage. Unlike the previous partition, the one they installed is elegant and sturdy. It also has a black rim, which nicely echoes the black edge of the mirrors as well as the faucets and fixtures. The family of three lived in the apartment during construction; this is something Katie <i>definitely</i> does not recommend especially when there is a toddler in the home and you’re sleeping on “a mattress on the floor surrounded by bags of caulking materials.” However, the couple’s Sweeten contractor kept things moving at a good pace, and clear communication made for realistic expectations of a &#8220;done&#8221; date.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had to stick to the original layout, which meant keeping a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in storage niche</a> by the window. It was covered in a sticky paper that made cleaning difficult and the saloon-style doors were not hitting the mark style-wise. With new tiles and the doors removed, the niche became “a breath of fresh air” to the new bathroom, Katie said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating for resale in Brooklyn: a kitchen and bath remodel enjoyed by current &amp; future homeowners</h2>
<h2><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heather and Doug&#8217;s 1980s South Slope condo was in need of an update, but given the family’s eventual plans to move, they kept putting off a renovation. When DIY fixes (also known as “tape”) were no longer enough, it became clear that finally renovating for future resale was the way to go. The end result? A sunny, modern kitchen &amp; bath renovation that the family knows will bring resale value—and that they get to enjoy in the present. </span></i><i style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on for Heather’s take on major changes in two key spaces.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/all-eyes-on-resale-for-this-kitchen-and-bath-renovation/"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19324 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg" alt="kitchen remodel" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/heather-kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Heather, South Park Slope homeowner</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband, Doug, and I moved into our small condo in South Park Slope shortly after our daughter was born six years ago. The building had been abandoned in the 1970s and then turned into eight small condo units in the 1980s. We love the community, the location, and many things about our space, but the kitchen and bathroom had clearly not been updated since the original condo conversion. With our son, Elijah, and daughter, Alice, now sharing a bedroom, we knew that we would eventually need one more room, so we didn’t see any reason to renovate. But then the cupboards and the appliances began to give out. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I work at a book publishing company and telecommute, so I spend a lot of time working at the kitchen table and dreamed about ripping out our old kitchen cupboards. After one too many times reapplying duct tape to the fridge shelves and silverware drawer, we decided to take the plunge and renovate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved reading the Sweeten renovation blogs and seeing the amazing transformation of other people’s homes. We had some recommendations for contractors from friends, but weren’t sure about the fit. So we </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osted our project</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sweeten and started to talk to contractors. What led us to choose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was his experience in renovating for resale. We were able to see some units that he was renovating in progress, and he had great suggestions for things to focus on for a possible sale in the future (like a dual showerhead, </span>which is really great for families with kids).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided on a classic, mostly white approach for the kitchen. Our plan was to add color with paint only, which would be easier for the next owners to change. With no edits to the layout or plumbing, we focused on choosing the materials that would make the most sense. We decided on Shaker-style cupboards from Home Depot and classic white subway tile for the kitchen backsplash from Nemo tile. Our counters are Caesarstone (from Appia Marble), the fridge is Samsung (from Home Depot), and the range is a Viking (from AJ Madison).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best changes was a little one: Previously, the stove was directly next to the sink. We added space between the sink and stove—having a place to rest a pot or put dirty plates out of view from people in the living room is very nice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom, we continued with the same subway tile from the kitchen for the walls, but veered from the “classic” plan on the floor tile. I loved the blue tile from Nemo and the idea of having a bright color in a classic herringbone pattern. No one was sure about this when we opened the box of tiles, but it is now our (and Lem’s) favorite part of the bathroom renovation. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given our short time frame, we ended up having to make many decisions quickly. But this made some of our choices less overwhelming. Instead of having 2,000 tubs to choose from, we would look at what was in stock (only 800!). While we spent quite a bit of time at big box stores and online, we also became acquainted with a few very helpful local places in our neighborhood that we will certainly go to again. I would encourage others doing a renovation to try to get a schedule of when cupboards, appliances, etc. will be needed (if not dates, then at what point in the process) because once you are</span> into the project, there is very little time to make decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our apartment was too small to live in with a renovation underway, we planned to move out for five weeks over the summer to accommodate the work. Everything went fairly smoothly, and Lem made sure that the apartment was ready for us to move back into on schedule. Given how small and close-knit our building is, I was very concerned about the renovation being disruptive for our neighbors. Lem took great care to cover the floor and other parts of the apartment so the noise wasn’t too much for our downstairs neighbors, and so that dust didn’t invade other parts of our apartment. All of the workers were respectful of our space, the building, and our neighbors, which meant a lot to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few add-on items that we chose not to do because we didn&#8217;t want to spend more money. One was having all of the outlets changed to new, stainless steel ones with USB ports. I plan to do this myself but wonder when that is going to happen. It probably would have been worth it to go ahead. The other was to have our floors redone. It seemed like too much to manage at the time, but now that the kitchen and bath look so nice, I notice how other parts of the apartment look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We LOVE our renovated space. The kitchen not only looks better, but it is infinitely easier to use and we have more storage space. It is amazing to have a real size fridge. The bathroom is also much more functional and looks bright and clean (even when it is not totally). Our old appliances in both the kitchen and the bathroom were energy intensive, and it was important to me to get an energy-efficient fridge and a low-flow toilet. They are little things in the bigger picture, but make me feel a little bit better about our environmental footprint.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">-Anishka Clarke tS member &amp; co-owner of Ishka Designs</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/park-slope-apartment-interior-makeover/"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10092" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png" alt="00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.png 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/00e_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-585x390.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The owner of this bright, 750sqft 1-bed in Park Slope works for one of the top 3 consulting firms in the US which means she works long hours and weekends, and travels a ridiculous amount for work &#8212; then, when she gets a break, she&#8217;s back out the door, traveling for leisure. Though she spends so much of her time away from home, she still finds time to &#8220;live&#8221; in each room and entertain regularly. When she first purchased her apartment a couple years ago, however, its vibe wasn&#8217;t right for her lifestyle, and she contacted tS member <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/402">Ishka Designs</a>, co-owned by Anishka Clarke &amp; Niya Bascom, to help make it her own. The Ishka team transformed the dark, cramped apartment into a relaxing oasis where this homeowner can unwind after her usual busy day or weeklong work trip, and likewise, its sophisticated, urban character makes it a perfect place to entertain high-level clients &amp; colleagues.<span id="more-10004"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10130" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg" alt="01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt Before" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01_theSweeten_Ishkadesigns-UnionSt-Before-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation — the apartment was painted in various colors from room to room which made the spaces feel disjointed, and in general, many of the existing finishes weren&#8217;t aligned with the homeowner&#8217;s tastes. The furniture around the home was also clunky and needed updating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10009" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/02_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The renovated bedroom is bright and tranquil. Anishka &amp; Niya chose to use a soft white paint, <a href="https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/962/gray-mist?color=962">BM Grey Mist</a>, throughout the apartment&#8217;s walls to amplify natural daylight and continuity between spaces. The bed was designed custom by Ishka Designs; we love how they&#8217;ve created the illusion that it&#8217;s actually floating in the space, without any legs or structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="07_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than using more traditional nightstands, the designers chose <a href="https://www.cb2.com/peekaboo-clear-nesting-tables-set-of-three/f117">acrylic nesting tables from CB2</a> which add to the weightlessness of the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10069" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="901" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/12_theSweeten_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-599x900.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the new bathroom design, they created a relaxing, Zen-like spa atmosphere, using subtle textures, a neutral color  palette, and clean lines.  The vanity is a custom unit made of walnut with marine-grade sealant; it was built by our friends at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors who were the contractors for the bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10012" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/05_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design team also created a custom media unit for the living room. The unit was designed not only to fit the space and character of the new home, but to perform specific functions for the client and keep the decor uncluttered. They also incorporated the room&#8217;s non-functional chimney as an extension of the media unit. It took a little convincing to get the homeowner onboard with painting the exposed brick, but it was definitely worthwhile, as the result really helps brighten the space and fits much better with the decor&#8217;s clean and pure aesthetic. The designers purchased the <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19620&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=143">Portica coffee table</a> and <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/product/detail.do?productGroup=19434&amp;catalog=filter&amp;menuCatalog=room&amp;menuCategory=201&amp;menuSubcategory=198">Loring sofa</a> from Room &amp; Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10015" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg" alt="Union St Apt" width="600" height="693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/06_IshkaDesigns_UnionSt-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anishka &amp; Niya sourced all of the artwork in the space from local, Brooklyn artists. The painting featured here in the dining space is by artist Jamal Ince; the vibrant piece makes a great compliment to the dining chairs by <a href="https://www.robertallendesign.com/">Robert Allen</a>. The dining table is by  <a href="https://www.mgbwhome.com/">Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams</a>.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" title="family-sitting-infront-of-fireplace"  class="aligncenter wp-image-38674 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756-723x482.jpg" alt="family sitting infront of fireplace and hardwood floors after renovation" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MG_3756.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“It&#8217;s an amazing feeling to walk into our apartment and feel like it&#8217;s our &#8216;home&#8217; &#8212; and we owe much of that to Peter and his team.”</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">–Marie Clare K., Homeowner</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Park Slopers Marie Clare &amp; Peter purchased their first home together early this year, the couple, along with their daughter Tessa, knew the space would need some improvements in order to make it the perfect retreat for their active lifestyle. Marie Clare, a copywriter for Bobbi Brown, and Peter, who works for Mayor Bloomberg, planned to modernize the 2 bedroom home, focusing on the living space &amp; bathroom. With a great sense of style and a clear, modern vision, they posted their project ideas to Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, and chose a Sweeten general contractor for the renovation. Firm owner Peter Ramirez impressed the new homeowners by completing the project in only 3 weeks to meet their March 30th move-in &#8212; and the results are as charming as little Tessa!</p>
<div id="attachment_8287" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8287" class="wp-image-8287" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/02_befores.jpg" alt="park slope home renovation" width="723" height="522" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/02_befores.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/02_befores-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8287" class="wp-caption-text">Before: Woodwork detailing throughout the home made the spaces feel dark and outdated &#8212; and those yellow walls weren&#8217;t helping either! The homeowners wanted to create a brighter and more open space, starting with the removal of a large archway that separated the living and dining spaces.</p></div>

Marie Clare &amp; Peter are long-time subscribers to shelter blogs &amp; magazines &#8212; and their enthusiasm shows through their curated material selections and collection of furniture, lighting &amp; decorative accessories. We love the ceiling fixtures they chose for the dining and living spaces: a white/wood <a href="https://www.westelm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turning Pendant by West Elm</a> and an <a href="https://www.lumens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artemis Fan by Minka Aire</a>.</p></div>

She says that the double-wide chair is perfect for taking in the beautiful view of the treetops outside her living room windows. At the far left we can see a new radiator cover that was built by NYC Pros to match the home&#8217;s traditional aesthetic.</p></div>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros delivered on every single one of his promises. He showed up when he said he would; he stuck to our budget (even suggesting areas where we could cut costs); and most importantly, he was always reachable and quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had throughout the renovation process.”</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">“[The NYC Pros] team was incredibly professional and they worked double-time to make sure that our apartment would be ready for our move in date; they finished work on a Friday and we moved in the next morning!”</h2>

The floor was done with <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Embarcadero</a> tiles in Market, and <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a> subway tiles in Ultra White are used in the shower; both are by Nemo Tile.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What was your bedroom like when you were 8 years old? It was probably pretty great &#8212; a place where your imagination could run wild, and that&#8217;s good enough for most 8-year-olds &#8212; but Jake&#8217;s new bedroom in Park Slope knocks most others right out of the water! Jake shared a room with his older brother until the family recently decided it was time the boys each had a space of their own. A small office in their home had the potential for a great 3rd bedroom, but because of its unusual floor plan &amp; limited area, Jake&#8217;s parents Ben &amp; Gail opted to hire a designer to maximize space &amp; functionality. The family brought in a Sweeten member who created an awesome new room where Jake can sleep, study, relax, play, and even host sleepovers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An outdated Park Slope kitchen gets a major update</h2>

<p>For those who love to cook and entertain, an outdated kitchen can pose some annoying setbacks. Brooklyn couple Erin &amp; Mark made do for 2 years in their Park Slope 1-bed before deciding to give their kitchen&#8217;s laminate surfaces and retro appliances a full upgrade. After having worked with a Sweeten member  on a previous bathroom update, they knew he&#8217;d be perfect to tackle their kitchen project too. Erin, a film distributor, and Mark, an editor/journalist (who just launched <a href="https://howlermagazine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cool soccer magazine</a>), couldn&#8217;t be happier with the result! So, we stopped in to check out the couple&#8217;s new, more functional kitchen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="old-cabinets-appliances-before-renovation"  class="wp-image-38632 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/before-560x420.jpeg" alt="off-white cabinets with brown wood trim and old appliances and hardwood floor and before renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/before.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/before-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Here&#8217;s what Mark &amp; Erin were working with for those first 2 years&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-7270"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="old-cabinets-appliances-before-renovation"  class="wp-image-38633 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/nickKnack_before-01-Edit-560x420.jpeg" alt="off-white cabinets with brown wood trim and white countertop and blue paint on wall and old appliances before renovation" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/nickKnack_before-01-Edit.jpeg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/nickKnack_before-01-Edit-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The laminate surfaces muster up some serious nostalgia &#8211;but not in a good way! It was definitely time to bring in the team at NKCI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stackable-washer-dryer-in-kitchen"  class="wp-image-38634 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9059ADJ-560x373.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray marble countertop and book shelves above see through overhead cabinets and stainless steel appliances and stackable laundry machines next to refrigerator after renovation" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9059ADJ.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9059ADJ-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> After 3.5 weeks of construction, voila! The new kitchen features white quartzite countertops and ceiling-high storage. The updated space is so much brighter and more efficient.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stackable-washer-dryer-in-kitchen"  class="wp-image-38635 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9049ADJ_1-560x840.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray marble countertop and under cabinet lighting and stainless steel appliances and stackable laundry machines next to refrigerator and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9049ADJ_1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9049ADJ_1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" />The cabinetry had originally arrived on site unfinished and was painted white by Nick &amp; his team. NKCI then built a custom unit to integrate the washer/dryer and refrigerator seamlessly into the white cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="overhead-cabinets-with-glass-doors"  class="wp-image-38636 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9014ADJ-560x373.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets with gray marble countertop and stainless steel undermount sink with see through overhead cabinets and under cabinet lighting and stainless steel appliances after renovation" width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9014ADJ.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9014ADJ-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Nick&#8217;s team installed under-cabinet as well as over-cabinet lighting, and they also integrated a speaker system into the cabinetry (you can see one of the speakers up on the shelf in the corner of the room).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-with-gray-marble-countertop"  class="wp-image-38637 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9040ADJ-560x373.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and gray marble countertop and undermount sink with overhead see through cabinets and hardwood floors after renovaiton " width="560" height="373" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9040ADJ.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9040ADJ-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> Another of Nick&#8217;s personal touches, are the glass-faced cabinets which are illuminated from within by strips of small LEDs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="peninsula-island-with-marble-countertop"  class="wp-image-38638 mb-24 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9077ADJ-560x840.jpg" alt="kitchen with white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and peninsula island and hardwood floors after renovation" width="560" height="840" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9077ADJ.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9077ADJ-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /> We&#8217;d agree that it’s a major improvement –many thanks to Erin &amp; Mark for sharing their new space!</p>
