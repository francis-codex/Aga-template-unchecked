<h3>Remodel a basement bathroom for a welcome upgrade</h3>
<p>I love my Arlington Ridge neighborhood with its hilly streets and access to the metro, my favorite Mexican restaurant, and grocery store. When I found the 2,000-square-foot 1950s Virginia ranch home, I fell for the windows, cathedral kitchen, glass porch, and spacious yard. My older sister, Missy, deciding to move from San Francisco back to the East Coast, was a perfect excuse to renovate. She asked to use my downstairs as her temporary home.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48731 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="basement bathroom" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></div>
<p>Before we renovated this (almost) windowless basement bathroom, it was creepy and unwelcoming. The shower had a horrible wall partitioning it off from the rest of the room. The door opened to a full view of the toilet. We never used it. I wanted an open-plan bathroom with plenty of light—a room that guests wouldn’t be scared to use when they visited me in Arlington.</p>
<p>I went into this as a first-time renovator. My biggest question was: Will it be a huge interruption in my workday? I work in business development, so I am on Zoom a lot. We posted our project on Sweeten and we could not have been happier with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contractor</a> we selected.</p>
<h3>Behind the not-so-pleasing wall</h3>
<p>When the contractor removed the wall, she discovered a very vintage pipe system that needed replacement. We looked for a plumbing specialist, and that search set us back a couple of days. Meanwhile, our contractor took the room down to the studs so the plumber could install new piping. The job involved breaking the foundation concrete, but even on days when the jackhammers were out or the water had to be turned off, we had advanced warning.</p>
<h3>Expanding the design palette</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48732" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="Arlington bath remodel" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NicoleTidwell-Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>My Sweeten contractor made the job seamless and easy, even though what I initially envisioned changed dramatically. I thought I wanted the bathroom all white and clean but decided instead to let this room give the downstairs character. When she proposed the sliding glass barn door as a shower enclosure, I was sold.</p>
<p>The vanity is another fantastic piece, not only for its look but for the storage it brought to the room. I never would have guessed I would <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pick the gray shower floor</a>, but it all came together and it works.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;My contractor was really helpful&#8230;providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<h3>A beautiful result, and a satisfying experience</h3>
<p>I wanted a modern bathroom to match the rest of the house—and my future renovation plans—and I really lucked out. My contractor was really helpful, connecting with my sister and me and providing the right resources and materials. I understood what to expect throughout the process, and we are both so happy with how the bathroom turned out. Missy, a former tech executive, now works as a startup advisor. She is really enjoying the new digs.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, my contractor’s crew was amazing. My one-year-old beagle, Callie, would shake with excitement when they arrived, play for ten minutes, and then allow them to work. She returned throughout the day to check progress and get head scratches.</p>
<p>My Sweeten general contractor answered my questions, updated me on changes, and discussed any challenges. The team was respectful of my space, too. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the downstairs areas</a> to keep them as clean as possible and left the workspace tidy. I scored with a respectful and professional contracting group that made my rip-and-replace renovation run smoothly, even as I worked from home. I always knew what to expect the next day.</p>

<h3>After a remodel, a basement bathroom has real appeal</h3>
<p>Missy’s gorgeous bathroom is now my favorite thing to show off in the house. It inspired her, too. She recently sold her house and is thinking about where she—and her Aussiedoodle, Ellie—should buy next. New, modern, and clean&#8230;what an upgrade.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to </span><span class="s1">remodel an uncomfortable small bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We initially looked for a move-in-ready home, but didn&#8217;t find many in our budget in Clarkson where we wanted to live. The bathrooms in our new split-level house were built in 1982. They would need to be remodeled eventually but we’d tackle them as we could afford them. Three ye</span><span class="s2">ars later and with a toddler in our midst, we were ready. The master bathroom would be our first big project.</span></p>
<div></div>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We had many problems with the original en-suite bathroom. Mainly, it was hideous. I disliked the color scheme on the wall, the warped laminate vanity, and the stick-on floor tiles. Not only was the pattern terrible, but the tiles were coming unglued. The plastic-insert shower was the worst offender. It was small and claustrophobic, and no amount of scrubbing would remove the mold and mildew stains. Even if it was just cleaned, the bathroom still felt dirty. I couldn’t stand showering in there.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The search for a compatible contractor in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d already gotten a few estimates, but we were looking to work with a Black-owned contracting firm and hadn’t found one with availability. In addition, not many contractors want to take on a small space bathroom renovation, not to mention on a minuscule budget. Then I stumbled on a Sweeten blog post featuring <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/support-black-owned-general-contractor-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned general contractors</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted my project</a> on Sweeten and found one that was also a <a href="https://sweeten.com/meet-sweeten-contractors/the-women-contractors-of-sweeten-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woman-owned general contracting firm</a>. I felt really good about her, and she was willing to squeeze us into her schedule.</span></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">Finding solutions on a shoestring budget</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, our biggest question was, “What does a bathroom remodel cost?” We had a limited budget and no idea what was reasonable. Our budget was $5,000, but quickly realized how below the average cost it was. We would have had to cut too many corners. We couldn&#8217;t afford to change the floorplan, so we agreed on the goal of transforming the bathroom into a pleasant, relaxing space. As a result, I decided to save money by designing the bathroom myself and doing it around an existing light fixture.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">A crash course in a small bathroom remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I started gathering bathroom remodeling ideas on Pinterest and making a vision board. We considered replacing the shower insert to keep costs down, but the contractor said it would just get gross again. I had no idea what went into building and tiling a walk-in shower. First, I found out it costs a lot more to install mosaic subway tile than larger tile. In addition, I learned that a shower floor’s drainage slope requires mosaic tile, and the ones that come in sheets require less labor. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg" alt="bathroom remodel Atlanta with subway shower tile" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48171" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-10-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48169 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg" alt="in-shower storage" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dina-Bathroom-After-8-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">With so many types of tile out there, we were glad to have the options narrowed for us. We chose large-format ceramic tile for the shower walls and hexagonal mosaic tile for the shower floor—in marble—as I wanted just one aspect to be luxurious. Even with the thoughtful choices, the materials and labor were costly. We gave up replastering the walls, removing the stippling from the ceiling, and installing a recessed light in the shower, all to keep costs down. We even kept the existing toilet, since it was fine.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">Coaching and seeking economy</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">There were moments when I felt like, “We just can’t afford to do this the right way,” but our Sweeten contractor helped us identify projects we could do ourselves (caulking holes and repairing molding). </span><span class="s1">We chose inexpensive bathroom flooring for the room. An inexpensive vanity helped, and I found the mirror at a discount home store for around $30. Consequently, we saved money and used quality materials where they mattered. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Our Sweeten contractor provided great input and direction—including talking me out of some bad tile choices and kindly suggesting bright, simple colors and patterns. She never took over the vision. She was organized and communicative, and we appreciated her helping us stay (almost) within our revised budget, even after plumbing issues popped up.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48289 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg" alt="color in bathroom" width="2048" height="1365" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2.jpeg 2048w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dina-Bathroom-After-2-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1">The final budget—and excellent outcome</span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All told, we more than doubled the original budget (thanks to our family for the generous gift!) coming in just at the starting minimum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost for a bathroom remodel</a> in Atlanta. This included labor, materials, random plumbing parts, and a zillion trips to Home Depot for the paint and other stuff I did on my own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The final result feels larger and is the <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spa bathroom</a> of my dreams. It’s so serene. My first bathroom with a walk-in shower and a natural stone floor, both of which feel truly luxe. It’s so lovely to step in there now. Everything is well-installed and of good quality. It’s exactly what we hoped for.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Refresh an old and outdated bathroom</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Penny, a product manager for a financial firm, and Kevin, a puppeteer with the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre, and their son, have lived in their over 100-year-old-plus co-op building for five years. They’ve been remodeling the Sunset Park, Brooklyn, apartment room by room, and until recently, waited on any major changes to the bathroom. They did, however, replace an old and “hideous” shower door with a curtain for a short-term fix. Once they were ready to bring the dingy space up to speed with their clean, simple style, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project on Sweeten</a> and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matched with a general contractor.</a><strong><br />

</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: While they stuck to the original footprint, Penny and Kevin made one big change that had a big impact on the overall look of the bathroom: replacing the bathtub for a walk-in shower. “We spent most of our budget converting the old tub,” Penny shared. They were especially excited about the brand new glass door. A big priority for the couple was sourcing materials locally. When they went to select their wood-like porcelain tile floor at a nearby supplier, they found the light blue and white tiles from the same store. The hardware and major fixtures also come from a Brooklyn showroom close to their home.</p>

The only issue that came up during the renovation was a leak from an apartment upstairs. It was resolved, as the neighbor became more vigilant about making sure water didn’t escape from outside her shower curtain, though if it leaks again, the issue will have to be readdressed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the biggest challenge was the division of labor between Penny, Kevin, and their contractor—especially since the family was out of town for the majority of the project. The couple divided responsibilities, with Penny taking on the budget and Kevin handling the aesthetic aspects. “He presented me with beautiful designs and then I approved or suggested how we could do things on a budget,” Penny said.</p>
<p>They coordinated with their general contractor mostly via email and phone calls. “His willingness to work with a neighbor, send emails, and call was really helpful,” Penny said. As an experienced renovator, she’s learned to be more trusting of a contractor’s advice, but also that it’s important to speak up about what you’re looking to achieve.  “Be clear on what you want, don’t give up on your design, but be flexible and listen to your contractor. You will be surprised on how that can help—they see a lot.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Penny also added these words of wisdom: “Go with the contractor that listens and seems pleasant to work with,” she said.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Fix water damage and give the main-floor bathroom a facelift in Valley Stream, Long Island</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: The problem with the first-floor bathroom in Marilyn’s 1950s home was twofold. While undergoing a separate renovation in the basement, the family discovered water damage in the bathroom that needed to be fixed ASAP. The subfloor was rotting out from what they assumed was pre-existing damage prior to their ownership of the home, plus a slow leak. Marilyn, a veteran renovator and construction manager, also wanted to give the bathroom a cosmetic facelift to make it more cohesive with the rest of her house. “I felt like my house was really modern (and totally my taste), and that bathroom was an eyesore,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="beige-bathroom-with-pedestal-sink"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48884 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Beige bathroom with pedestal sink and bathtub before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-Before-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Eager to complete the renovation in time for Christmas dinner when plenty of guests would be in her home, Marilyn posted her <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/25914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor</a> early in December. They tackled the water damage first by reinforcing joists and demoing the rest of the space, removing the bathtub, toilet, vanity, and old tile flooring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She had initially debated replacing the bathtub with a rain <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/luxury-shower-systems-steaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shower</a>, but it was the only bathtub in the house (and one her kids loved to use). Instead, she set out to find a deep tub that would add to the luxury feel of the space. “I actually had to get this special ordered, because it&#8217;s really, really deep and wide,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marilyn spent an entire day at the tile store, searching for the perfect ones for the wall, floor, and shower. “I fell in love with the white subway tile, but I went with a gray grout,” she said. Along the shower and bath wall, she opted for a gray gradient tile, and then a pop of color in the storage niche with a turquoise that ties in with the wall color. The modern <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vanity</a> boasts lots of storage for the smaller space, thanks to the large drawers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given her expertise and knowledge of the industry, Marilyn was very hands-on throughout the renovation and worked directly with her Sweeten contractor on finding, picking, and negotiating prices on materials. One of the biggest and only challenges they ran into was accommodating the oversized bathtub. “It’s almost like jutting out past the wall a little bit, but he was able to get a nice little silver trim just so everything looks kind of consistent. We had to shimmy things to make it straight,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Marilyn-Ordonez-Bathroom-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="attachment noopener wp-att-35620 noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="white-subway-tiles-on-half-wall"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48878 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg" alt="White subway tiles on half wall with glossy brown vanity and white sink and brown wooden floor tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" title="brown-vanity-with-long-cabinet-pulls"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48882 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Brown vanity with long cabinet pulls in a white and blue bathroom with dark floor after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marilyn-Bathroom-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results were totally worth it and the project was completed just in time. “I absolutely love it. I get lots and lots of compliments from everyone who comes to my home, and it&#8217;s always really nice,” Marilyn said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Marilyn’s daughters are in love with the giant new bathtub. She said, “Both of my girls get in this big tub, and it&#8217;s like a little swimming pool for them!” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span>: Bathtub, 21&#8243; deep: <a href="https://maax.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maax.</a> Hague 3-light vanity light, Maxted modern wall shelf, robe hook, toilet ring, and Kohler medicine cabinet, K-2967-BR1: <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayfair</a>.

<h3>Before: Give a Gramercy bathroom a much-needed facelift for storage, style</h3>
<p>Dated tile (“the bathroom looked like a 1980s Mafia movie!”) and no storage (“with a pedestal sink and no drawers or shelving, we didn&#8217;t even have room to store extra toilet paper”) drove homeowners Jessica and Kevin to finally renovate their bathroom. She’d been living in the 750-square-foot, one-bedroom co-op overlooking Pete&#8217;s Tavern, the oldest tavern in NYC, for seven years. Renovating the bathroom had been on her remodeling bucket list since day one.</p>

<p>After getting married, they used wedding money to fund their renovation, enthusiastic to update the aesthetics by losing the “burnt-red marble, gold hardware, and wall-to-wall mirrors” and adding storage solutions. Jessica <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chose her Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: A dramatic change resulted when white modern tile replaced the “heinous red marble tile” Jessica still has nightmares about. Their bathroom, which was trapped in an ‘80s vibe, became a calming, minimal space aligned with the couple’s style. The white and pale gray palette lent the former bathroom new life with a spa feel.</p>
<p>The couple replaced the “clunky” bathtub with a modern shower with two heads and switched to chrome fixtures. Next, they <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled their storage woes</a>. A console sink with open shelving for towels gave an airy illusion and contributed to the room feeling more spacious.</p>
<p>While designing their new bath space, Jessica was mindful of potential future buyers. She said, “When I bought the apartment, I found it very frustrating there were so many permanent fixtures, including a built-in glass shelf over the toilet, wall-to-wall mirrors, and tile covering most of the walls.&#8221; To give the next homeowners the room to express their own personal touch, she kept the walls painted instead of tiled, installed a mirror that could easily be replaced over the vanity table, and hung two simple towel hooks.</p>

<p>Jessica offered this sage advice, ”If you are purchasing your own materials for the renovation, have it arrive before the start date.” This will help <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/renovation-cost-savings-avoid-order-and-delivery-hiccups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid waiting for products to arrive</a> and delaying the project.</p>
<p>Now Jessica calls her new bathroom a happy place and is appreciative of her well-matched contractor. “As with any NYC renovation, you tend to get a lot of complaints about uncontrollable things like dust and loud noise which comes with the territory of living in an apartment building. My Sweeten contractor handled everything like a pro and had much more patience for people than I ever could have exhibited,” she said. “He was extremely flexible and true to his word with regards <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to price and timing of the project</a>.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: Jessica <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled their storage</a> by adding a two-drawer unit under the existing vanity table as well as a cabinet, creating a “personal heaven” she uses every morning to get ready for work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 6 smart solutions for bathroom storage help decrease clutter and increase space</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small bathroom can be home to a large amount of storage space. The key is to get creative and use every nook and cranny you have to help store your essentials. Carefully plotting the layout and layering in key features like the Sweeten renovations below can help maximize space and minimize clutter—making a beautiful and functional bathroom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>

Their <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> contractor installed a recessed wall unit behind the door, creating almost-hidden additional storage.</p>

Here, she is able to store extra towels and other toiletries.</p>

They considered (and used!) multiple bathroom storage solutions in the space. The designer recommended leaving the tub in its place and moving the toilet so they can fit a larger vanity. Plus, the six inches of space behind the shower wall allowed the couple to add double-storage niches.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22105 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Lauren_Bathroom-13-14.gif" alt="Recessed cabinet in bathroom for extra storage" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" />For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/food-writer-uses-hotel-inspired-style-art-deco-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Ross</a>, their bathroom was in need of a major overhaul. They wanted a hotel-inspired vibe that included more storage. So they had custom a shower niche put in as well as a large in-wall cabinet—perfect for hiding toiletries and other essentials.</p>

They upgraded it with double mirrors, featuring storage ledges for a more modern storage interpretation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b></b><b></b>A hex tile bathroom provides a new look, plus a West Elm side table moonlights as a vanity</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we took a peek at Amy and Nick’s sparkling new <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/waterfall-counter-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen</a>. This week, we’re exploring their new bathroom, which takes a style cue from a previous Sweeten story.</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-hex-tile-bathroom"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-49234 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Amy-BathKitchen-04.jpg" alt="White bathroom with black hex tile along with sink and vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Refresh an outdated bath in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After purchasing their 2-bed, 1-bath condo, it became clear to Amy and Nick that the old bathroom needed to be given new life. The layout worked, but the tile and fixtures were tired and out-of-style, and a low ceiling made the space feel cramped.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had successfully renovated their kitchen (and who they’d found on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with general contractors after </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posting their project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) got to work on the bathroom remodel. The layout was preserved but the footprint was expanded; one wall was moved and the ceiling was raised to make the space feel larger. The old tile was ripped up and replaced with a hex tile bathroom floor paired with high-contrast white grout. White subway tile was installed in the shower, along the side of the tub, and across the lower half of the walls. All new fixtures in polished chrome gave the space a bright boost. A new sink and vanity with a Calacatta gold <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> countertop was placed center stage (the marble was also added to the windowsill and threshold), while a wall-mounted faucet provides a sleek, contemporary look. It took a couple of tries for Amy and Nick to find the right <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toilet</a> that would work with their piping; Amy explained, &#8220;W</span>e knew from the beginning we needed a horizontal connection—just not all the horizontally piped toilets we bought worked for our specific connection. Eventually, we just had our contractor pick one out for us and switched the handle so it was more in line aesthetically with what we&#8217;d originally picked out.&#8221; A large, recessed medicine cabinet was added above the sink in addition to customized storage; &#8220;I like the two built-in nooks (in the shower)—it makes it easy to separate bath products by person and height. We&#8217;re also both really pleased with the way the side table/vanity turned out,&#8221; said Amy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The vanity was fashioned from a West Elm side table customized to fit a countertop and pedestal sink. Amy was inspired by Sweeten homeowners </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen and Ben</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who created their own custom vanity in a similar way.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Style finds</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Hex floor tile in a matte finish: </span><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Merola-Tile-Metro-Hex-2-in-Matte-11-1-8-in-x12-5-8-in-Black-Porcelain-Mosaic-9-64-sq-ft-case-FXLM2HMB/203684370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Depot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These 5 remodeling projects prove that with a $15-20K budget, homeowners can get <em>a lot</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tiles are popping off the wall, the toilet makes a strange gurgling sound when it flushes, and stepping into the shower feels like entering a dark closet. If this situation sounds familiar, then your bathroom is ready for an upgrade. But what will it cost? A $15k-20k budget is an excellent range to cover all the basic bathroom renovation costs—materials, installation, and labor included—for a new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/toilets-101-beyond-the-basic-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toilet</a>, sink, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanity</a>, fixtures, tile, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring</a>, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighting</a>. With that in mind, it’s also important to consider that the need for plumbing, electrical, or layout changes will likely add to the amount. <span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with general contractors showcases five of their bathroom remodels below as</span> good examples of what a $15K-20K budget will allow.</p>
<h3>$15k takes the blues away in a Brooklyn bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26277 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Alison_Kitchen-Bathroom-09-723x964.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="964" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison and Jovito&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon purchasing a 1910 brick row house, Allison and Jovito got to work on a serious renovation, starting with the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom hadn’t been touched since the 1950s and was very blue—blue tub, blue toilet, blue tile. With a budget of $15k to cover essential bathroom renovation costs, which limited them from expanding the footprint or moving plumbing, the goal was to focus on form and function. A new, dual-flush toilet, console sink, and clawfoot tub—all in white—replaced the original blue fixtures. The simple, classic look they achieved with marble flooring and white subway tile mesh well with the history of the house.</p>
<h3>Sleek fixtures and denim-like tile shine for $15K</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="$15k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1066" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mario and Joe’s main motivation for their apartment renovation was the bathroom. With a budget of $15k, they kicked off their remodel with a gray porcelain tile that had the look of coarse denim and installed it along the floor and vanity wall. The sink was swapped out for a streamlined <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ikea-bath-vanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IKEA vanity</a> that was customized to fit a raised basin sink, and the existing mirrored medicine cabinet was replaced with a much larger one. A glass shower door, slim toilet, brushed nickel fixtures, and light above the vanity complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>For $17K, a Brooklyn couple raises the ceiling and gets double cabinet storage</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25122 size-chrono" title="$17k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_EllenBathroom-05_1000-723x1064.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1064" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-ellen-bens-brooklyn-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen and Ben&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Kensington, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budgeting $17k for the bathroom renovation costs, Ellen and Ben decided to focus on modernizing their master bath. To make it feel more open, the stand-up shower and dropped ceiling were removed and replaced with an open shower stall fitted with a glass door. The beige vanity was kicked to the curb and a wooden side table from West Elm, customized to fit a marble countertop and sink, took its place. Two medicine cabinets installed side by side provide ample storage. A new toilet and fixtures complete the functional upgrade, while black hexagon floor tile and floor-to-ceiling white subway tile fulfill the modern aesthetic.</p>
<h3>An architect&#8217;s $20K travel-inspired bathroom remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24180 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Erin_Bathroom-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="1084" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/an-architect-drafts-a-travel-inspired-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian and Erin&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An uninspired bathroom led Brian and Erin to a $20k remodel that would take their space on an international adventure. The remodel was prompted by outdated fixtures and finishes from the ‘80s and a leak in an upstairs bathroom that had ruined the ceiling. To create a unique space, Brian drew inspiration from the many hotel bathrooms he had seen while traveling for work as an architect. Floor-to-ceiling white subway tile was chosen as a simple backdrop, while blue penny tile was selected for the floor. Mirroring the blue tile, a luxurious clawfoot tub with a blue exterior took the look from standard to standout. The rest of the space was outfitted with a new toilet and bronze fixtures, an antique basin table and sink, and a custom red balau wood medicine cabinet.</p>
<h3>For $20K, everything had to go (except the tub and toilet!)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20616 size-chrono" title="$20k bathroom renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation costs" width="723" height="509" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-723x509.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02-300x211.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Celeste_Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celeste&#8217;s bathroom</a> in Park Slope, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stained limestone tiling in her bathroom was the tipping point for Celeste, who, after a few unsuccessful attempts to remove the stains, budgeted $20k for bathroom renovation costs. Creating more <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage</a> space became a priority, so a custom vanity with unique drawer configurations was installed. In order to decrease visual clutter, a dedicated spot within the vanity was designed to hold a small trash can. Celeste chose a marble tile with a cube effect for the floor and beveled subway tile for the walls. Although she decided to keep her original tub and toilet, she finished the look with additional new materials like the sink, countertop, and a new lighting fixture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25429 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-723x510.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-300x212.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-22-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guest post by Tribeca homeowner and architect Ana</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25151 size-full" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="647" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24996 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25013 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>(Above) Living room<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25010 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25008 mb-0 size-full" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25081 mb-0 size-chrono" title="vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg" alt="vanity" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Mary_Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Turn an old, run-down bathroom into something elegant and calming</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Mary Ann and Frank’s three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment had done its job since they had bought it in 1992.  But now, with their two kids grown and gone, the couple pulled the trigger on a long-planned master bathroom upgrade. “Our co-op building was built in 1929 and it was the bath from 1929<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span></i>same tub, same tiles,” said Mary Ann, who works in publishing. Grime on the tiles wouldn’t budge and some tiles were no longer there at all. Paint peeled off the walls and with no vanity, shampoo bottles were always on prime display. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: To keep the costs down, the couple kept the original layout. But that was all they kept. What they wanted was a stylish sanctuary beginning with a hex tile bathroom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hexagons were laid on the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floor</a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble</a> topped off the vanity for a refined look. The shower also has matching marble tiles. Their <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor</a> suggested painting, not tiling, the wall opposite the shower and vanity. Rather than feeling enclosed, the bathroom now feels “more like a room,” said Mary Ann, “and plus it would have been a lot of cleaning.” They did lose storage space in their master and hall bathroom, which they also renovated. However, a large vanity and two large mirrors with <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> built into the wall that were added to the master bathroom made up for that. When you open each mirror, there is also another magnifying mirror. The vanity has six large drawers and two cabinets for storing toilet paper and cleaning supplies. &#8220;We were just going for a more calmer, less cluttered look,” said Mary Ann. “Now, everything is put away.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Mary Ann’s centerpiece is a walk-in shower so large “you can do yoga in it.” The old tub was decommissioned and replaced with a walk-in shower with glass walls. “It’s so much fun to take a shower now,” said Mary Ann.  </span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25203 mb-0 size-chrono" title="IKEA bathroom vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg" alt="IKEA bath vanity" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When designing your new bathroom, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-clever-bathroom-storage-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage</a> and organization is key to creating a clutter-free, soothing environment. The bath vanity you choose will have a big impact on the amount of storage you can fit. Choose a stock or pre-fab unit from stores like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a>, <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Depot</a>, and <a href="https://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lowe&#8217;s</a>—or you can have one <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom built</a>. Unless you have an unusual layout or are looking to do something dramatic with your <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design</a>, a custom vanity isn’t always necessary. Stock vanities can offer plenty of storage, work with any style, and are budget-friendly. <strong>Here are 5 examples of Sweeten homeowners who chose an IKEA vanity for their space.</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A stained oak IKEA vanity offsets a &#8220;denim&#8221; palette<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25194 size-chrono" title="IKEA bathroom vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_MarioApt-01-723x1066.jpg" alt="IKEA bath vanity" width="723" height="1066" /></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario and Joe designed their bathroom</a> around a striated gray porcelain tile that had the appearance of coarse denim. To balance out the cool gray tile, they chose a stained oak IKEA vanity for their bath and worked with their Sweeten contractor to build a custom countertop to fit a Kraus sink on top for a more unique look.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">An IKEA vanity keeps a stunning bathroom clutter-free<br />
<img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom renovation" width="725" height="1086" class="alignnone wp-image-43638" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-bathroom-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Janet &amp; Jerry credited Sweeten with helping them achieve <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a &#8220;</a><span>stunning redesign&#8221; of their bathroom. The upgrades include an in-wall toilet, a vertical-space shower with skylight, and striking stone floor tiles. A double-drawer IKEA vanity keeps toiletries and bathroom supplies out of sight, allowing the bathrooms&#8217; striking design to stand out. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A dark walnut IKEA bathroom vanity stands out<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25197 size-chrono" title="IKEA bathroom vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="IKEA bath vanity" width="723" height="1085" /></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on making <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their small bathroom</a> feel less cluttered, Fabio and Melina supersized their storage with an IKEA vanity in a walnut wood finish, pairing it with marble and brass shelves from CB2. Bronze fixtures and hardware plus a handmade, cement and granite Moroccan floor tile add warmth and character.</p>
<h3>An IKEA bathroom vanity makes sense for a growing family<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />
</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25199 size-chrono" title="IKEA bathroom vanity" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Linsday_Kitchen-01-723x1058.jpg" alt="IKEA bath vanity" width="723" height="1058" /></a></h3>
<p>Although <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/lindsay-and-matts-sweetened-brooklyn-coop-renovation-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bathroom in their new home</a> had been recently updated, the finishes felt cheap and bland. Lindsay and Matt set out to increase storage to accommodate their growing family. The pedestal sink was replaced with a sleek square sink and two-drawer IKEA bathroom vanity, while new lighting made the space feel brighter.<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Kirsten_Apartment-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p>Homeowners Bellamy and Zak knew their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly-purchased 1900s brownstone</a> needed a &#8220;serious facelift&#8221;. The renovation list was extensive: <span>a master bedroom, master closet, master bathroom, guest bedroom, and laundry room. The master bathroom has a mix of luxe details (a heated bathroom floor!) and budget-friendly features, like this double-wide IKEA vanity with custom fronts by Semihandmade.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Map out your bathroom storage strategy, using a vanity, shelves, custom built-ins and secret niches</h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20746 " title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Laura-M_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #76808f;">Laura and Matthew&#8217;s double drawer</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/laura-kitchen-bathroom-renovation-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wall-hung vanity</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">With all the fixtures taking up space in the bathroom—sinks, toilet, plus tub or shower—it can be hard to also fit sufficient storage. The vanity alone is rarely enough. And if your space is traditional, with a pedestal sink, the need is greater. However, with smart planning that addresses all the tasks in the bath, you can find the best bathroom storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a><span> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Planning your space</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">First, figure out where the fixtures will go. If you’re remodeling, you need to decide if everything stays put or if something moves. Evaluate the floor and wall space to find areas for storage—bathroom cabinets, shelves, or freestanding pieces like furniture. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Bathroom vanity</b></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Once a simple box with doors and drawers for storing toiletries, the vanity has expanded its capabilities. Manufacturers like <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kohler</a> and <a href="https://www.duravit.us/html/default/home.us-en.html#/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duravit</a> have introduced built-in internal storage compartments that corral items small, medium and large, while still remaining in arm’s reach. Look for helpful add-ons like electrical outlets, adjustable shelves, and rollout trays. For existing vanities, small acrylic trays and storage boxes at the <a href="https://www.containerstore.com/welcome.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Container Store</a> fit a variety of drawer dimensions. If the bathroom is shared, and you have room for twin vanities instead of one large one, go for it! This allows each occupant to organize the space exactly as he or she wishes. </span><span class="s1">You can identify the type of vanity you want from among the following styles:</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Floating &#8211; This style, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attached to the wall</a>, keeps the floor clear for an open look. You can find models from manufacturers like <a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decorá</a> that include at least one drawer unde</span><span class="s3">r the sink. Expect a small cutout in the middle of the top drawer to clear the plumbing pipes, and still allow room on the left and right. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">*Freestanding &#8211; The advantage here is the vanity can be moved, with little impact on the wall behind it. It typically goes countertop to floor so there’s more square footage for storage and more door-and-drawer combos. <a class="" href="https://ronbow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronbow</a> makes vanities with integrated sinks and storage below starting as narrow as 19 inches wide, good to fit twin sets in a small bath. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-laura-and-peters-uptown-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console styles</a> closely resemble furniture, with shapely legs below the cabinet to create an open effect, and usually incorporate a shelf near the bottom.<br />
<b><br />
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><b>Built-in cabinets</b></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This might be custom cabinetry, similar to what you would order for the kitchen, and from many of the same manufacturers. Or it might be <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/celestes-sweetened-park-slope-bathroom-homeowner-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bespoke</a>, crafted by a carpenter. Because the unit is built into a wall, it can be as large and long as you want. It also allows the addition of matching units above the counter, on either side of the sink, or between double sinks. You get lots of opportunities to vary door, drawer, and open shelf combos above and below the counter. <a href="https://www.kraftmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KraftMaid</a> makes a narrow pullout unit with shelves, much like a pantry, to make use of a narrow vertical space. Consider upper cabinets with glass doors as bathroom storage for towels and pretty toiletries in a spa-like display.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Freestanding cabinets</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Similar to kitchen solutions, you can add a cabinet or an open case fitted with shelves in any free space in the bath. Make sure there is clearance for any activity taking place nearby. The advantage here is that the shelves can be adjusted when you wish—to hold a hamper or bath towels on a lower shelf, and smaller personal care items at arm level. Another alternative: a shelf that is not a shelf, such as an étagère—an open-back shelving unit—or one side of a ladder. These repurposed bathroom storage ideas can be found at resale shops or some furniture stores that make small decorative furniture for the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in shelves</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-and-after-ellens-kensington-bathroom-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelves</a> maximize <span class="s1">vertical space anywhere there is an open wall space with studs that provide support for attaching the units. Find a place for shelves adjacent to a sink, between sinks, or flanking sinks, above a toilet tank, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, on a wall a foot or so from the shower, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity. In addition to shelves that match a manufacturer’s vanity collection, options include a wide selection of widths and depths or you can have a carpenter craft shelves to exact specifications. As with vanities, they come in a variety of </span>styles.</p>
<p class="p1">The most versatile, these shelves go anywhere there is sufficient support to attach them: above the toilet, between sinks or flanking sinks, high up around the perimeter of the ceiling, or even a shallow ledge above the vanity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21983 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Fabio_Kitchen-Bathroom-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #76808f;">Melina and Fabio&#8217;s gold and marble</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/70s-apartment-gets-dose-luxury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating shelves</a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Medicine cabinets</strong></span></span><span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Why go for a simple mirror when you can capture storage above the sink too? You have two options for storage here, with medicine cabinets that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/before-after-mario-and-joes-clinton-hill-bathroom-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recess into a wall</a> or mount on the wall, each with the traditional mirrored door that opens out.<br />
<b><br />
*</b>Recessed &#8211; Placed in the shallow wall space between studs, this style comes in versions from 4 to 8 inches deep—big enough to stow rolls of toilet paper. Kohler offers one for less than $100. <a href="https://www.robern.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robern</a> adds options with one, two, or three doors as well as electrical outlets for added organization and versatility.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><b>*</b>Wall mount &#8211; If you mount the cabinet on the surface of the wall, check out Decorá, which makes a model with storage shelves that slide out from either side, disappearing when not in use.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-19471 size-chrono" title="bathroom storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-600x900.jpg" alt="bathroom storage" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SWEETEN_Eric_Apartment-05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><br />
</a><span style="color: #76808f;">Maria and Eric&#8217;s</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-modern-gut-renovation-goes-scandinavian-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-in niche</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Built-in niche</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">This type of shelf is located in a recessed area, such as between studs or even between two cabinets. Built-ins also work on a smaller scale in the shower, in the form of a niche for shampoos and soaps. In the wall above the tub, you can go larger and perhaps fit a couple shelves for a practical display of bath salts and liquid soaps. For visual interest, insert mirrored panels or beadboard on the back surfaces of the niches, or paint them a contrasting color.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s2"><strong>Furniture</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">In addition to the small decorative pieces described above, it can be fun to introduce a vintage dresser or bookcase, if you have the room. Use the top to display personal items as well as toiletries. Drawers hold towels, small appliances like a hair dryer or electric razor. </span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Solve your bathroom storage with some of the suggestions described above, and begin to enjoy the serene space you deserve.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m so attached to the pedestal sink in my bathroom that I was a bit surprised when a client I&#8217;m working with requested a wood vanity cabinet for his bathroom. Why would someone want a vanity?</p>
<p>The most obvious reason is that vanities provide storage that we all need, especially in small New York City apartments. And even the simplest wood vanity adds warmth to a bathroom finished with tile floors and walls and ceramic fixtures. It makes the space feel less utilitarian and more like a real furnished room. Now, after doing a bit of research, I&#8217;m entirely convinced.</p>
<p>Designers sometimes repurpose old night tables and chest of drawers to serve as vanities. Conversely, a lot of vanities are designed to look like antique furniture. I like this kind of &#8220;themed&#8221; vanity in Powder Rooms or Guest Bathrooms, which aren&#8217;t used every day. Can you imagine using <a href="https://www.bathgems.com/" target="_blank">this vanity</a> everyday? I think it was once used by Napoleon.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY TRADE WINDS EMPIRE" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4768146788_a83322bd45.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/" target="_blank">vanity</a> was made from an old Chinese trunk. It&#8217;s a dramatic, fantastic look that would look great in a discotheque.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY COLE AND CO CHINESE CHEST" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4767507037_9a3820def2.jpg" /></p>
<p>One trend now is to use &#8220;vessel sinks,&#8221; bowl-shaped sinks that rest on top of a vanity like a washbasin. I like these but water often splashes over the edge of the bowl and it constantly needs to be wiped down. But vessel sinks have a very pretty look, like this <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/onlinecatalog/detail.jsp?prod_num=2200" target="_blank">low, round sink</a> that&#8217;s set on a wood stand.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY KOHLER BELL" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4767507175_607f6b5059.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of handsome, simple vanities. There&#8217;s the basic style with two wood doors below, the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd_192257-444-NR24-JVO_0_?productId=1226361&amp;Ntt=vanity%2024&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;Ns=p_product_price%7C0&amp;pl=1&amp;currentURL=/pl__0__s?Ntk=i_products$rpp=30$No=480$Ntt=vanity%2024$Ns=p_product_price%7C0$identifier=" target="_blank">platonic ideal</a> of vanity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY JAVA OAK RIDEFIELD" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4768145736_4ac8450489.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd_192257-444-NC24D-JAV_0_?productId=1268663&amp;Ntt=vanity%2024&amp;Ntk=i_products&amp;Ns=p_product_price%7C0" target="_blank">This simple one</a> has three stacked drawers. It&#8217;s straddles the line perfectly between traditional and modern.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY LOWES JAVA CREST" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4767506231_07fe25f918.jpg" /></p>
<p>This pristine <a href="https://rh.com/" target="_blank">white wood vanity</a> would look perfect in a country home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY RESTORATION CARTWRIGHT" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4767506685_003f3d0f89.jpg" /></p>
<p>For whatever reason, there are a lot of Shaker-style vanities. <a href="https://www.faucetdirect.com/sagehill-designs-al2421-24-bathroom-vanity-cabinet-with-open-display-shelf-from-the-allure-collection/p1121879?source=gba%7C1121879&amp;CAWELAID=437563236" target="_blank">This one</a> has an open rack below for towels.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="VANITY SAGE HILL" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4767506849_a7d9df5c07.jpg" /></p>
<p>This terribly elegant vanity was inspired by Federalist style furniture. But it&#8217;s clean, fine, ladylike lines alos have a luxurious 30&#8217;s modern kind of style. I can imagine a very spirited and beautiful young woman a la Katherine Hepburn preening in front of this piece. I guess that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called vanities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday <a href="https://sweeten.com/about">Jean</a>, Becky and I visited <a href="https://www.bklyndesigns.com/">Bklyn Designs</a>, the annual showcase at St. Ann&#8217;s Warehouse for local designers and craftspeople. There were upholsterers, woodworkers, carpet makers, and metalsmiths there, all showing off the beautiful things they produced in their Brooklyn studios.</p>
<p>Two rising furniture-makers with very different sensibilities made a big impression.</p>
<p><a href="https://colleenanderic.com/">Colleen and Eric</a> design lovely, playful home furnishings inspired by far-fetched ideas. Small brass rivets are recessed into the dark wood top of the &#8220;Northstar Table&#8221; like stars in the constellation. If you locate the northstar and press down on it, a secret side drawer slides open. It&#8217;s the perfect place to stash a diary, jewelry, or contraband.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3580/4609972472_cb9653e2ff.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC NIGHTSTAR TABLE DETAIL" /></p>
<p>Colleen and Eric&#8217;s &#8220;Hold on Tight Bookshelf&#8221; takes unlikely inspiration from the image of books toppling sideways off an open shelf. This simple maple shelf is capped at one end and has a brightly-colored, sliding metal stop at the other. The toy-like mechanism is a pretty accent and also a lot of fun. Becky couldn&#8217;t stop playing with the display model and Jean and I finally had to drag her away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1188/4609972250_b3539e1cfa.jpg" alt="COLLEEN AND ERIC HOLDONTIGHT" /></p>

<p>Colleen and Eric also make accessories like tote bags and keychains. Their product lines are sure to expand further as they&#8217;re struck by new ideas. It &#8216;ll be fun to see what they&#8217;ve come up with at next year&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>In contrast, the pieces from Kai-Wei Hsu&#8217;s shop <a href="https://www.kwhfurniture.com/">KWH Furniture</a> take inspiration from the elemental qualities of the woods that they&#8217;re made from. The furniture in the new &#8220;Vice&#8221; line doesn&#8217;t shout out for attention. Each piece has a clear, modern sensibility and yet is so restrained so that it wouldn&#8217;t feel out of a place in a traditional interior.</p>
<p>The elegant &#8220;Bar Cart&#8221; is made from white oak with a cerused finish. The first thing you&#8217;re drawn to is the fine grain and stain of the wood.</p>

<p>Then, as you lean in closer, you understand the exquisite workmanship of the piece. The outer corners of the frame are held together with wood splices.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4609973430_5fff0ce9ab.jpg" alt="KWH BAR CART DETAIL 02" /></p>
<p>The similarly elegant &#8220;Vanity Table&#8221; is made from black walnut with an oil finish. Its proportions are perfectly balanced. The first think that strikes you is the sumptuous finish in the wood.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1317/4609363631_a18322cabf.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY" /></p>
<p>Then when you move in closer, as you&#8217;re bound to do, you see how subtly and precisely the drawers are fitted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/4609363865_1d49899a26.jpg" alt="KWH VANITY DETAIL 03" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how Kai-Wei&#8217;s designs evolve as he explores new materials and details. Whatever direction the pieces take, I&#8217;m certain they&#8217;ll all have the same immaculate craftsmanship.</p>
