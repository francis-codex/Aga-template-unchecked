<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Making the decision in a work-from-home moment</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">When it came to this renovation and our decisions about it, the pandemic was a true influence. Kevin and I previously lived in a two-bedroom apartment, using one bedroom as an office—but working from home, we needed more space. I am a television producer and Kevin is a broadcast engineer. In the end, never leaving home was the motivator we needed to make a move.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We found a <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-bedroom house</a> in L.A.’s Westchester neighborhood with plans to use two of the bedrooms as our home offices. Added bonus: the property also had the backyard that we and our dogs, Joey and Stevie, wanted.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Hiring a qualified general contractor—with guidance</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">As first-timers for a renovation of this scale, we had questions. The biggest ones: How long it would take and how much it would cost? The team at <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> guided us through the process of getting bids from several contractors, and the website prepared us for <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-guide-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what to expect</a> during work.

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Updating the house mechanics</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Our home was built in 1950 and, with a previous renovation, gained an addition in the ‘60s, including the living room, primary bedroom, and a half-bath. But before beginning, we had dirty work to do. We replaced the sewer line to the street and pipes under the house, tented the house for termites, reinforced the foundation, and updated the electrical.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49424 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19.jpg" alt="Image of Los Angeles homeowners sitting in living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s8">&#8220;We felt a true match with our contractor and I love how our home turned out: clean and solid.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">The renovation plan included several phases. First, we wanted to lay new flooring throughout the house. We chose white-oak engineered hardwood in 8-inch planks, to showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel cohesive. We felt that lighter floors would complement the living room’s existing natural wood ceiling. In fact, our vision for the space was guided by that beamed ceiling, and a desire to open the home’s center, front to back.</span></p>
<h3>A wider and elongated kitchen</h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We met with our contractor and his in-house kitchen designer. Most importantly, we wanted to discuss how to increase flow to the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L-shaped kitchen</a>. We decided to widen the kitchen doorway and remove part of the 6.5-foot wall that separated it from the living room. We planned to build a long, modern peninsula to draw the kitchen through the opening and <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-los-angeles-full-home-renovation-gets-an-ubermodern-look-inside-and-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrate it with the living space</a>. It would make the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/remodeling-a-kitchen-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen more functional</a>. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49440 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1.jpg" alt="Image of kitchen cabinets with brass fixtures and white counters" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-16-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We stacked and boxed in the washer and dryer and created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. That gave us room to add a large pantry in the kitchen space. Our contractor’s crew custom-built the cabinets and suggested matte brass hardware and fixtures, which we love. Choosing the countertop stone took time—after researching online, we visited stone yards and showrooms before agreeing on a light-gray quartz. </span></p>
<p>We originally planned to paint the shiplap walls in the kitchen white, but after the walls were sanded and primed, we opted for the white-washed look instead. We could always paint it later if we changed our minds.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">A private bathroom for each family member</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Next came the <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathrooms</a>. We don&#8217;t really have a primary—it&#8217;s more like <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-west/how-to-remodel-a-bathroom-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“his” and “hers.”</a> I claimed the one with the bathtub and my husband got the other one, a half-bath when we bought the house. Part of the 1960s renovation, it was odd, narrow, and tight with its very own exterior door! We redesigned it, finding space for a shower by removing the door and an adjacent window, and bumping out approximately 20 inches into the breakfast nook area. Since we were removing the natural light sources, our contractor suggested adding a skylight. We’re happy we took this idea.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49439 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg" alt="Image of a bathroom with wood sink vanity and black sink backsplash" width="666" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1.jpg 666w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-15-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49438 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated bathroom tub with white subway tile walls" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-14-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Like Kevin’s, my bathroom also got a makeover. We installed new tile, fixtures, a vanity, and hardware. One other idea we got from our contractor was to choose wall-mounted toilets. The bathrooms are small—mine, especially—and the streamlined toilets free up vital inches.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49434 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated white tile bathroom with walk-in shower and skylight" width="667" height="1000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1.jpg 667w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-10-1-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">Shopping for materials</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We sourced most materials ourselves. At the project’s start, our contractor gave us a preferred vendor list, which helped us to know where to shop for tile, plumbing fixtures, and other essentials. When we visited brick-and-mortar locations, we researched first and knew exactly what to look at. I understand why people <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/home-interior-design-trends-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work with designers</a>! We made a lot of decisions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" class="elementor-button-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Connect with Sweeten contractors</span></a></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">Shopping for lighting fixtures was fun, though. A friend who worked at a lighting showroom recommended a woman-owned Portland lighting company, leading us to beautiful choices for the bathrooms, kitchen, and bedroom. The pandemic definitely affected the supply chain: A refrigerator order took six months to arrive.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49425 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1.jpg" alt="Image of a renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<h3 class="p4"><span class="s8">The renovators’ learning curve</span></h3>
<p>As two people with no major renovation experience, it felt like a challenge. Fortunately, we were lucky to have a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-a-general-contractor-for-your-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general contractor who guided us</a>. We learned a lot about balancing time and budget—how long things would take and the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-per-square-foot-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effect on cost</a>. Sweeten’s check-ins gave us peace of mind; I knew I could ask questions if issues arose. My advice to other renovators is, make sure your <a href="https://sweeten.com/ca/los-angeles-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contractor is licensed and insured</a>, and consider whether you can communicate clearly with him or her—you need to understand each other.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s8">We felt a true match with our contractor and I love how our home turned out: clean and solid. It’s comforting to know that things were done right. I love the final touches brought to the project by interior designer Ana DeLeon of Delena Studio, whom we hired on our contractor’s recommendation. We thought we wanted help figuring out where to hang art, but</span><span class="s9"> she advised us on rugs, too, and it was her idea to use the leather loveseat at the dining table.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s8">The <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">result is a gorgeous home</a> with space for both of us to do our things. I’m so happy!</span></p>

<p><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Nate. &#8220;</i><span class="s1"><i>After&#8221; photos by Lena Yaremenko.</i></span></p>
<h3>A new home becomes a passion project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Michelle and Nate, both freelance advertising creatives from Brooklyn, bought a 2,010-square-foot house in Long Island, NY. Built in 1994 by the previous owner, Nate found the home in good condition. “Luckily, the house didn’t need anything to enjoy it right away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We looked at it as a fun long-term project to turn it into an escape from the city,” Nate said. Nestled in the woods and surrounded by local farms, wineries, and nearby beaches, the Long Island home was perfect for their plans. The first item on the to-do list was to add another bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Happy homeowners sitting on the couch with their dog" width="1000" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49146" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-01-300x240.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nate_Michelle-Bathroom-01-600x480.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong></span></p>

<h3>A closet repurposed</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it easier to accommodate guests, the couple wanted each bedroom to have its own bath. There was a large alcove in the upstairs hallway that they thought would be the perfect ensuite guest bathroom. It was conveniently located above the downstairs bathroom and plumbing so they hoped it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to transform. “Our main question was really just how difficult would it be to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-a-bathroom-renovation-take/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516480067964000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGyH1pCCFGN6MXH3vylt6iOnb95Dw">add a bathroom</a> where one hadn’t existed before,” said Nate. He posted their Riverhead bathroom remodel on Sweeten and was <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten general contractor</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We had to be out of town a lot during the work, but our contractor was really good about sending work-in-progress pictures.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>A modern farmhouse bathroom</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before getting started, Michelle and Nate nailed down the look and feel of the bath, opting for a modern country vibe that was clean and simple. Because the angled roof affected one of the walls, they got creative with the layout, choosing to build a triangular storage nook in the uniquely-shaped space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shiplap was added to the slanted wall, giving the room the desired farmhouse style the couple hoped to achieve. They also incorporated some personal touches, including handmade shelves that Nate built from reclaimed wood. A pull-out drawer was repurposed from an old door to hold cleaning supplies and extra toilet paper. For the entry, the couple took a style cue from the neighboring farms. “We especially like the look and function of the sliding barn door,” Nate said.</p>

<h3>Managing the Riverhead bathroom remodel from afar</h3>
<p>Michelle and Nate searched a variety of brands to outfit their bath but always found themselves coming back to one retailer. “The nice thing about getting fixtures from one place is that you know the metals will match. Oil-rubbed bronze, for example, can look very different from one brand to the next,” said Nate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We had to be out of town a lot during the work but our contractor was really good about sending work-in-progress photos,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The pictures helped make sure things came together the way we imagined them.&#8221;</p>
