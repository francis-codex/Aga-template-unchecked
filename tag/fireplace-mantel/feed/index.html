<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><strong>Homeowners:</strong> Geoffrey, an architect, and Alicia, who works in operations at a FinTech startup, posted their modern <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/123489#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room remodel</a> on Sweeten</li>
<li><strong>Where:</strong> Manhattan on Central Park South</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> An updated living room creates custom zones with millwork and additional walls in their one-bedroom apartment</li>
<li><strong>With:</strong> <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten general contractor</a></li>
<li><strong>Homeowner&#8217;s quote:</strong> &#8220;Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with homeowner Geoffrey. <span class="s1">&#8220;After&#8221; photos by Kate Glicksberg.</span></i></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">An opportunity to invest in Central Park South</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the pandemic, we saw a lot of people giving up on New York, and thought it was the perfect time to double down. We drew a box around the southern half of Central Park and started searching. A lot of units had recently been taken off the market but we reached out to realtors to see if the sellers were still interested in making a move. We found our home in an ideal building and location, and made an offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners and their dog" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52587" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our 1,000-square-foot apartment is in an iconic mid-century building on Central Park South, which we felt offered us the best of all worlds. The Upper East and Upper West sides were easy to get to, and we love being able to spend our weekends alternating between the two.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A love of pre-war layouts</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, we’d always lived in pre-war buildings with architectural character and well-defined floor plans. You don’t get a lot of that in modern buildings like the mid-century one we landed in, so we created our own. We posted our project on <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, and hired our general contractor. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg" alt="dining room and modern living room remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52579 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Geoffrey-fireplace.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-53002 size-full" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn&#8217;t be adding molding, chair rail, or opening up the kitchen, which are so popular these days. Instead, our plan was to define the layout in discrete ways that would <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/entire-home/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create separate zones</a>—a proper entry foyer, a generous space for dining, and a desk niche.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our apartment’s original living room was 13 feet across and more than 30 feet long, so we had plenty of space to work with. Our goal was to create a more intimate and purposeful space that could be used for entertaining as well as a dedicated workspace for those work-from-home days.</span></p>
<h3>Creating niches in a modern living room remodel</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most New Yorkers, this was all about maximizing the available square footage. We had an opportunity to divide the extra-large living space for different purposes. By adding a small wall near the entrance to the apartment, we created a foyer on one side and an office area on the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the living room, the focal point was a 14-foot wall with custom-designed millwork crafted from European white oak and marble. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-materials-101/carrara-vs-calacatta-marble-what-is-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single slab of Carrara marble</a> houses an electric <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace</a> and a recessed TV. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg" alt="modern living room remodel with niche office desk" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-52584 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/123489_Geoffrey_09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">&#8220;[M]ake sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.&#8221;</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the winter, the apartment could feel a bit dreary (our courtyard views prevent us from getting a ton of natural light). Installing a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/adding-fireplace-renovation-gas-wood-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fireplace would turn up the cozy-dial</a>, and we designed the entire living space around that idea. We couldn’t do a real fireplace and weren’t interested in dealing with the hassle of gels or fuel logs. We chose a beautiful electric fireplace that was the most convincing artificial unit we could find.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The white oak used throughout the renovation featured strong horizontal lines echoing the building’s iconic mid-century exterior. The material also helped brighten up the space. Bump-outs of the walls near the window created a defined dining area. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marble slab realities</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single biggest issue during the renovation was with the large slab of Carrara marble that would clad the front of our fireplace and media wall. It was 7 feet tall and about 5 feet wide, and we insisted that it have mitered corners. We had no idea what an ordeal it would be—the mitered corners were fragile, and a slab that size was very unwieldy. Maneuvering it through the parking garage and up the freight elevator was a half-day exercise that culminated in hours of positioning, tweaking, and polishing. We were scared the entire time that this 500-pound piece of marble would break and we’d have to start all over!</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Align your budget and your expectations</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten was an invaluable resource in helping us find an initial list of contractors. I had access to reviews and see their work, all in one place. It was also great to know that they had my back if something went awry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice to renovators? Really <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dig into the contractors</a> you’re interviewing. Make sure that you’re 100% sure that they can do the kind of work that you want, and make sure that you’re aligning your own expectations with the kind of money that you want to spend. You can’t expect million-dollar work on a thousand-dollar budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of our budget, we did pretty well and came within <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the projected cost</a>. It was about $35,000 including the fireplace. Overall, we couldn’t be happier. The space is doing <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything we wanted it to</a>, and we’re excited to cozy up in front of the “fire” this winter.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>Making the space modern</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan closed on their 1,000-square-foot, co-op apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. They loved the prewar apartment&#8217;s location and proximity to the park. But, they were put off by the interior’s worn and outdated appearance. The color scheme—yellowy-beige walls against the bright red brick of a non-functioning fireplace and tired cherry cabinets—was not to their taste.</p>

<p>The walls had been repainted too many times to count. As a result, it had a “thick, uneven, mushroom-colored appearance.” The wiring, which lined around the baseboards, was nonfunctional. Layers of shiny yellow varnish obscured the parquet wood floors (which Cat was partial to, having grown up in a home with it).</p>
<p>The couple wanted to brighten up the space by stripping the walls and floors. Bookcases around the fireplace would add interest to the long span of wall. A new dark gray kitchen ticked the box of the “warm modern home with spare decorations&#8221; they wanted.</p>
<h3>Finding the right renovation team</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal was to make their apartment “look as big, bright, and clean as possible.” They were uncertain about how to turn their vision into reality. They weren&#8217;t &#8220;design people,&#8221; Cat admitted, and “needed a lot of guidance.” Posting their project on Sweeten, they found a contractor to provide the direction they needed. The couple described the process: “The contractor genuinely loves working with clients, explaining choices and limitations. He knew when to give us the ultimate stylistic decision and when to push back with his expert opinion.”</p>

<h3>Installing dark gray kitchen cabinetry</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, they would create an elegant and functional design. Since the kitchen opens into the living room, it was important for the materials in both rooms to echo each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dark gray kitchen cabinetry contrasted with white quartz countertops and a stainless steel backsplash. Instead of handles, drawers had carved-out pull tabs for a streamlined look. The utensil drawers were made of natural walnut. Cat said, “I never thought that the inside of a drawer could, or even should, be beautiful, but I appreciate seeing the woodwork every time I reach for a utensil.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26871 mb-0 size-chrono" title="custom drawer" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-06-08.gif" alt="custom drawer" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<h3>Adding a kitchen peninsula</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some minor changes made as the demolition got underway. Originally, an island was planned for additional prep and storage space, but the demo revealed that the dividing wall couldn&#8217;t be knocked down. They scaled the island back to a <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen peninsula</a> with a smaller footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the end,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the peninsula was perfect and very functional.” On the kitchen side, the peninsula held the kitchenware and cookware, along with a trash and recycling bin. On the dining room side, napkins, placemats, and cookbooks filled the cabinet space.</p>

<h3>Changing up format and flooring</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor suggested the modern and very useful reverse L-shaped bar top. It provided a “comfortable and practical surface for resting a coffee mug or working on a laptop.” The open design between the bar and peninsula created a seamless transition to the living space. The bar top was a natural spot for appetizers when entertaining, and “people seem to naturally congregate around it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan were most excited about the kitchen floor tiles. Cat wanted an abstract, black-and-white pattern. With their contractor&#8217;s help, they decided on a medley of Moroccan cement tiles in black, white, and gray hues. As Jordan explained, “The more traditional patterns reflected the age of the apartment and the black casement windows, while the mix of different patterns added an informal feel.&#8221; The same tile configuration sits in front of the fireplace tying the two rooms together.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26882 size-chrono" title="custom bookcases" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<h3>The value of skim coating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the living room, their contractor designed a new fireplace mantel to complement the new built-in bookshelves. The clean lines provided a focal point. The walls were also skim coated and repainted. Initially, Jordan did not see the value in spending the time and money on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skim coating</a> (a texturing technique to hide construction tape and other imperfections to give walls a smooth and plaster-like appearance). However, they were so glad they did it. “I can’t believe what a difference it made—the whole place looks lighter, brighter, and fresher.” The parquet floors were stripped and refinished in a matte coating, preserving their original wood tones.</p>

<h3>Living at home during a renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cat and Jordan&#8217;s biggest challenge was <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living through the construction</a>. It took longer than expected due to hold-ups with the cabinetry. They had to wash dishes in the bathroom and eat a lot of takeout. Wicket, their Norfolk Terrier, was curious about all the construction, so a baby gate was set up to keep her safe. “Wicket was pretty suspicious of the floor-sanding equipment, wood-cutting tools, and other supplies,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Luckily, our contractors did a fantastic job consolidating the equipment in the construction zone and cleaning up at the end of each day, so we only had a few barking flip-outs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26883 mb-0 size-chrono" title="dining area" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-13-723x482.jpg" alt="custom bookcases" width="723" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, the couple has a bit of advice for future renovators. They say watch some home renovation shows to get design ideas. However, &#8220;prepare yourself for the possibility that something unexpected can happen during a renovation, especially in an old building.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While no budget-blowing issues came up, they did learn to take construction surprises in stride. “Having watched so many renovation TV shows, we felt relieved that nothing major popped up and were less disturbed by minor changes in the plans.”</p>
