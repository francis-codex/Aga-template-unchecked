<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our most up-to-date Atlanta </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no denying Atlanta is a booming city. Between 2010 and 2018, Atlanta was the fourth-fastest growing city in the nation, adding a little less than 700,000 people and now sits at close to six million inhabitants. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, it’s a great time to put down roots in Atlanta—from restoring a bungalow in Decatur, adding to a classic Georgian-style home in Druid Hill, or </span><span class="s2">remodeling</span><span class="s1"> a loft apartment in the Old Fourth Ward. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free renovation platform that matches homeowners with licensed general contractors and tracks their project, offers this guide detailing costs to remodel in Atlanta as a starting point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When embarking on a renovation, ‘How much will it cost?’ will likely be your first question. It’s notable in Atlanta that once a renovation budget reaches a couple $100,000s, building a new house instead becomes a major consideration. In this situation, you’ll need to factor in costs to tear down the existing structure and remove debris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Read on for a breakdown of typical starting costs for remodeling across Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on five categories: full home, kitchen, bathroom, outdoor spaces, and permits.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Gut renovation: </span><span class="s3">Starting at around <strong>$70</strong>—<strong>$100 </strong></span><span class="s2">psf </span><span class="s1">(per square foot)<br /></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong>—<strong>$30,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$35,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen remodel: Starting at <strong>$65,000</strong></span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Budget bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$12,500</strong>—<strong>$15,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Starting at <strong>$20,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end bathroom remodel and reconfiguration: Starting at <strong>$35,000+</strong></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Deck</span><span class="s1"> composite: <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Wood deck: <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46402" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1.png" alt="Sweeten Find Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTA-FindGCs-1-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta home remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A total gut renovation in Atlanta that brings your home down to the studs and dresses it back up again with budget</span><span class="s3"> finishes will likely start at around <strong>$70</strong> to <strong>$100</strong> psf,</span><span class="s1"> according to Atlanta-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6670#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Dexter</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He recently worked on a renovation that redid everything except for the basement. “We renovated about 85 percent of this house,” said Dexter. It was a 1950s house that involved redoing the siding, repairing, and polishing the original wood floors, remodeling two bathrooms with a custom shower in one and new tub in the other while adding gold-look faucets and an oversized kitchen island with a farmhouse sink. Subsequently, by using high-end finishes and custom elements, that renovation came in <strong>$120,000</strong> for the end budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6745#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Kimberly</a> is currently working on a 3,200 square foot farmhouse renovation. The budget is at <strong>$150,000</strong>, which includes renovating three bathrooms and expanding the fourth for a larger master suite and a kitchen remodel that includes custom kitchen cabinets and quartz countertops. “We will be making some smart choices to make it look brand spanking new without breaking the budget,” said Kimberly, adding that the owners were rolling their sleeves up to do some work themselves to reduce the budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Kimberly is about to start demolition on the project which will reveal if any rewiring is needed to bring the old building up to code. One issue common in Atlanta’s older homes is subpar work that might have been completed previously by an unlicensed contractor. “The budget could go as high as <strong>$225,000</strong>,” she said, bringing the farmhouse reno to about <strong>$75</strong> psf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, another factor that can have a big impact on a budget for an extensive renovation is the age of the house and whether it had <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead paint or asbestos</a>, according to Dexter. Anything built before 1978 could have lead paint in it. Anything built between the ‘30s and the end of the ‘80s could have asbestos. That’s why Dexter gets homes built in those time periods tested. Subsequently, if it comes back positive, the removal of lead or asbestos could add a few thousand dollars to your budget while pushing your timeline back.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48249 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="740" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts-.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--300x222.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Atlanta-RemodelingCosts--600x444.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The typical quote detailing costs to remodel a minor kitchen in Atlanta ranges between <strong>$20,000</strong> to <strong>$30,000</strong> for a 200-square-foot space which</span><span class="s3"> includes labor and rough materials such as drywall</span><span class="s1">. This number doesn’t budge all that much because it is mostly calculated on installation rather than materials. </span><span class="s1">In a budget kitchen remodel, it’s a good idea to keep lighting where it is while refreshing the fixtures, according to Sweeten expert Kimberly. For a mid-grade to high-end budget, you should be able to change the location of lights. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additional material costs include elements such as replacing cabinet fronts, a basic granite countertop, basic lighting, energy-efficient appliances, faucets, and resilient flooring. For example, you could go for a good value kitchen appliance package with a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and oven for <strong>$3,500</strong> from Home Depot. A similar package from high-end brands could set you back <strong>$20,000</strong>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at some mid-grade to high-end kitchen costs:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect the average mid-grade kitchen renovation to come in around <strong>$175</strong> psf or <strong>$35,000</strong> for the Atlanta area. A 200-square-feet space would reveal laminate countertops, a 15-square-foot island, semi-custom wood cabinets, and a double stainless steel sink with a standard single-lever faucet. It also contained a built-in microwave, dishwasher, and custom lighting. Keeping your layout the same will be the biggest factor in keeping your budget down.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">High-end kitchen renovations came in at around <strong>$325</strong> psf or <strong>$65,000</strong>. A 200-square-foot kitchen would include custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances were also kicked up a few notches to include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much an Atlanta bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a typical bathroom quote, expect the cost to come in </span><span class="s3">between <strong>$12,500</strong> to <strong>$15,000</strong></span><span class="s1">. The budget focuses on installation and does not include some key materials. This gives renovators the freedom to shop for what they want while having greater autonomy over their project’s budget. This cost range does include a vanity with a basic granite top, toilet, and tub or shower. Homeowners can shop for finishes such as faucets, tiles, and mirrors. For a project with a lower budget, Dexter advised renovators to stick to tiles in the <strong>$2</strong> psf range and faucets made from chrome or brushed nickel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a look at mid-grade to high-end bathroom budgets:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">In the Atlanta area, the average cost of a mid-grade kitchen remodel comes in about <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$571</strong> psf. This range applies to a 35-square-feet space and installing a new porcelain-on-steel bathtub, ceramic tiles, and a recessed medicine cabinet with built-in lighting. A renovation of this level can add about <strong>$13,000</strong> to a home’s value, which recoups close to 65 percent of the project’s cost, according to <i>Remodeling’</i>s Cost vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/"><span class="s7">report</span></a>. Not a bad investment.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A popular remodel is taking out the tubs to put in showers. However, avoiding this and working with the layout that you have can easily shave off <strong>$4,000</strong> in a bathroom budget. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">The average bathroom remodel cost in the high-end category starts at around <strong>$35,000</strong>. For this budget, you could expand your bathroom from 35 square feet to around 100 square feet and can play around with elements like a freestanding soaker tub and a shower with recessed shelves, a frameless glass enclosure, and body spray fixtures. You’re also likely to afford a double-sink and double-mirror vanity with custom draws and wall cabinets. In Kimberly’s experience, a high-end bathroom remodel typically involves using marble or quartz, replacing a rod and shower curtain with glass and adding elements like double shower heads.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Costs for adding outdoor space in Atlanta</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you don’t mind a bit of humidity, an outdoor area can be used year-round (although, a fan and mosquito netting is a smart addition for summer). <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add or renovate your deck or patio</a> and it will be like adding another room to your home. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The average price for a 320-square-foot deck made from composite is <strong>$20,000</strong> or <strong>$61</strong> psf, according to the Cost Vs Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/south-atlantic/atlanta-ga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s7">report</span></a> for 2020. Composite is a mix of wood and plastic, making it more durable to weather and termites than just wood. A project using this material will add about 60 percent of the cost back into your home’s value. If you do use wood, it will reduce your budget by more than 25 percent to <strong>$14,000</strong> or <strong>$44</strong> psf. A deck made with wood will add 70 percent of the project cost to your home’s value.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Consequently, the majority of Dexter’s clients go with a wood deck rather than composite. A recent client had him rebuild a deck and cover it with flyscreen. It was about 300 square feet and the job was done for a total of <strong>$20,000</strong> or about <strong>$65</strong> psf.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding stone to a concrete slab for a patio will start at about <strong>$12</strong> psf, according to Kimberly. If you want to add lighting and ceiling fans, then add another <strong>$5,000</strong> to your budget for fixtures and wiring. An outdoor kitchen could range from <strong>$5,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong>. “In Atlanta, people plan spaces for entertaining purposes,” said Kimberly.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Permit costs</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building permit fees are often calculated by the square footage of your project, or by the overall budget cost. To see how your area’s permits are calculated, check with your local building department. Your general contractor will likely put an estimated amount in your initial budget before a final amount is calculated. “There’s no rule of thumb when it comes to the cost of permits,” said Sweeten contractor Dexter. “Some areas I can pull a permit for <strong>$50</strong>, but the same job in another county could cost <strong>$200</strong>.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t just the cost of the actual permit that needs to go into the budget. Additionally, you also need to pay your contractors for the time it takes them to pull the permit. In some counties in Atlanta you can file electronically. Other counties, a contractor or architect will need to show up in person with paper plans, said Kimberly. A typical fee to have someone file your permits can range between <strong>$300</strong> and <strong>$1,000</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <span class="s7">cost</span> of building permits for the city of Atlanta, the area including and immediately surrounding the downtown area, is <strong>$7</strong> per <strong>$1,000</strong> for construction. Electrical, plumbing, and mechanical permits also have their own fees, which start between <strong>$75</strong> and <strong>$175</strong> per project. Your general contractor will be familiar with the costs and will also be filing your building permits on your behalf.</span><span class="s8"> </span></p>
<p>Permits vary greatly in different areas of Atlanta. Neighborhoods like <a href="https://www.johnscreekga.gov/pdfs/cd-fee-schedule.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span aria-invalid="spelling">John&#8217;s</span> Creek</a> and Alpharetta typically have more fees to consider. Permit fees are less expensive in <a href="https://cityofsugarhill.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Fee_Schedule_Amendment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar Hill</a> in Gwinnett County and Forsyth County.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To confirm a budget, a general contractor will want to see the site for a more accurate assessment of costs. Having your “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves” list paired with a realistic budget will have you on your way to your dream home. </span></p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">Atlanta homeowners can expect gut renovation costs in the range of $70 to $100 psf. This would bring an Atlanta-area home down to the studs and dress it back up with budget finishes.
