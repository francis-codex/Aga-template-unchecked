<h2>No space? No problem! Get inspired by these small entryway ideas by Sweeten</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: the entryway is the first space—and the last—everyone sees in your home. It&#8217;s a perfect space for making a statement, and it deserves a careful balance of form and function. Regardless of your usable square footage, there are great options for style and utility improvements in even the smallest of entryways. Here, we highlight 5 design-forward small entryway ideas by Sweeten contractors.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 1: Enlarge a small entryway area</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44263" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jessica-S-entryway-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39880" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg" alt="foyer" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWEETEN-Randy-Goldsmith-Apt-12-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For an 1,800-square-foot apartment in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side, a couple hired architect Jessica Wetters to help reimagine the space. It was a full-gut renovation of the kitchen, master bedroom, living area, and bathroom, as well as <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/"><span class="s2">the entry area.</span></a> The entry was a relatively simple job, since they were gutting the rest of the house, but it brought outsized benefits: a great first impression, an enlarged space to fit a comfortable bench, and a floating shelf for essentials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Laura and Randy put an offer on their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/diamond-in-the-rough-upper-east-side-nyc/"><span class="s2">Upper East Side co-op</span></a>, they envisioned an all-new, more functional layout. Central to the plan was the small entryway. &#8220;We knew we wanted to extend the entryway as it was incredibly narrow with two closets on either side of the front door,&#8221; Laura said. &#8220;We decided to keep the larger walk-in and remove the smaller one, to create a place that was pretty but also functional.&#8221; The couple completed the statement with stunning, geometric-patterned wallpaper</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 2: Use wallpaper to make a statement</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43738" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg" alt="wallpaper foyer" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jessica-Entryway-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41440" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Herrmann-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jessica and Alex had rented for six years before buying an <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/long-time-renters-shine-as-renovating-homeowners/"><span class="s2">800-square-foot co-op</span></a> in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Although they were thrilled to finally own a home, they knew the apartment would need work before feeling like their home. They remodeled the galley kitchen and the bathroom and reconfigured a few closets. They also gave the entryway some attention, with carefully chosen wallpaper to make a visual statement. &#8220;The subtle raffia gives texture and depth to the walls,&#8221; said Jessica. &#8220;We chose materials that would stand the test of time from both an aesthetic and durability standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For media executive Jenifer Herrmann and her partner Mitzie Wong (co-founder of creative design firm <a href="https://roarandrabbit.com/"><span class="s2">Roar + Rabbit),</span></a> wallpaper was likewise the way to make a statement in their newly renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/"><span class="s2">entryway.</span></a> They added Rhye wallpaper in hand foil and completed the look with a round mirror from <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/"><span class="s2">Serena &amp; Lily </span></a>and a console from <a href="https://www.westelm.com/"><span class="s2">West Elm—</span></a>elements that complemented their nature theme.</span></p>
<h3>Idea 3: Combine function + design accents</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41693" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Andrew-DAngelo-Home-06-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40969" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="1501" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-ErinGibbons-Apt-13-585x878.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tina, a designer, and her husband Andrew wished they had entryway storage for shoes and coats. When they planned a complete renovation of their  <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/ground-floor-co-op-sunnyside-queens/"><span class="s2">1930s co-op</span></a> in Sunnyside, New York, they had to contend with tight space constraints in the entryway. Since they couldn&#8217;t enlarge the space, they used their imaginations to maximize the space, combining form with function. They added a small bench, along with hooks for bags and coats, all set against a shiplap background. &#8220;We love the clean lines and texture of details of the shiplap,&#8221; said Tina.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Erin and Chris, their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-homecoming-hudson-heights/"><span class="s2">three-bedroom, two-bath co-op</span></a> in a post-war, 1950s building also lacked storage at the entry. To remedy, they installed a bench with storage bins underneath and overhead. For finishing touches they added wicker baskets, a floating shelf, and a metal-framed mirror to the adjacent wall</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 4: Add a statement piece</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41912" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Aurora-Farewell-Condo-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After renting for many years, John wanted to start building equity. He bought a <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/murray-hill-full-apartment-renovation/"><span class="s2">1,200-square-foot apartment</span></a> on Park Avenue in New York City, with gorgeous views of the skyline. He enlisted architect <a href="https://aurorafarewell.com/"><span class="s2">Aurora Farewell</span></a> to help improve the layout and add professional touches, to make the space feel cohesive and thoughtfully designed. For the entryway, he wanted a sense of drama. He and the architect chose a large round mirror to cover most of the wall, above a minimalistic, multifunction wood bench</span>.</p>
<h3>Idea 5: Make the entryway space do double duty</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-0" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="entryway" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/">Chris and Jeremy</a></span><span class="s2"> had hoped to renovate sometime in the distant future. Then, water damage from a leaky apartment above required immediate attention, inspiring them to go beyond repairs and jump into a larger renovation. In addition to the bathroom, they remodeled their kitchen and living areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">They also knew the foyer presented an interesting opportunity. It was large enough to feel like wasted spaces if they left it empty, but too small for any obvious uses. Their Sweeten general contractor helped them find an imaginative solution. &#8220;We decided on a full-height bookcase that’s only 8-inches deep. It holds loads more than we expected,&#8221; said Jeremy. &#8220;On the opposite side, our general contractor fitted narrow custom cabinets to serve as a bar.&#8221; Art lights hang over tall mirrors, giving a classic gallery sensibility</span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A wide variety of front door styles lets homeowners upgrade looks <em>and</em> security</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31125 mb-10 size-chrono" title="front door and entryway" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-723x482.jpg" alt="front door" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Nazli-door.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span class="img-label"> Nazli and Larry&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone renovation</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First impressions make lasting impressions, and this is as true of your home as it is of anything else in life. Let’s begin with the front door. It’s the focal point of your entry and the feature upon which pretty much everything else hinges—literally. You can go dramatic or understated, but you want a door that works with the style of your house while also keeping it secure and free from drafts. The right choice will set you well on your way to the kind of curb appeal that also gives a boost to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-is-home-equity-and-home-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the value of your home</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s plenty to consider when selecting from front door styles. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers a rundown of front door styles—materials, colors, accessories, and add-ons—to help you navigate the process.</p>
<h3>When should you upgrade a front door?</h3>
<p>In short: security, energy efficiency, and good looks. The appropriate door performs on many levels. It’s also a good investment. The National Association of Realtors advises that homeowners can expect as much as an 80 percent return on <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/renovating-your-home-for-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">window and door upgrades</a> at closing. If you’re not moving, this enhancement makes you a better neighbor and a happier homeowner with a prettier front entrance. Prices across front door styles can range from $200 up to $2,000+ if you add on sidelights, transoms, or different finishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also seize the opportunity to upgrade security with a newer, more secure lock system. Additionally, you could also get an energy-efficient door that reduces air leakage and cuts your utility costs!</p>
<h3>Finding your front door style</h3>
<p>The choice is yours, and you can have whatever you want—windows or a solid panel, sidelights, or a transom. To maximize curb appeal, you should stick with a door that fits with the architecture of your home. Today’s houses, especially new construction, can often be a hybrid that includes features from different eras. For example, you&#8217;ll see Tudor plus French Revival, or Spanish Colonial plus Craftsman. Consult with a professional (an architect, your contractor, or a door company sales rep) who has experience pairing the right door with a particular house style. You can also research architectural home styles online, like on manufacturers’ websites, and compare what you find with your home. <a href="https://www.thermatru.com/inspiration/doorways-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therma-Tru Doors offers the DoorWays app</a>, which allows you to try out different doors on an image of your own front entrance.</p>

<h3>Front door systems and configurations</h3>
<p>You’ll find that entry doors are often referred to as “door systems.” This means they come pre-hung in a frame and pre-drilled for both doorknob and deadbolt, not just a mere rectangular slab. The system should also include the door’s bottom edge, which interlocks with the threshold. It will also likely have weather stripping encircling the door’s perimeter. This setup is convenient and sensible. This way, you purchase all the door features from one manufacturer to ensure everything functions well together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re replacing an existing door, you will want it to be the same size as the previous one, unless you are taking apart the entire entryway for a dramatic change. Changing the dimensions of the door (like adding sidelights or a transom) involves reframing the opening. For this type of involved job, you want to work with a general contractor. Before committing to a particular door, consult with your own contractor to ensure the door will fit. (Do this before it is paid for and delivered!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other terms you’ll encounter are “flush” and “paneled.” Flush doors are flat and smooth on both faces. Paneled doors have rectangular recesses framed by horizontal rails and vertical stiles. Originally, panel construction was meant to minimize cracking and warping on wood doors. They do this by giving the panels room to shift with changes in humidity. The “look” caught on, and it can now be found in other door materials. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h3>Front door material choices</h3>
<p>When you see the word “door,” you may automatically think “wood.” However, there’s more to materials nowadays, including fiberglass, steel, and wood composites. In each of these categories, doors are typically made of more than one material. Other materials are incorporated to enhance stability and energy efficiency. A wood door may have a steel interior, a steel door may have a wood exterior, a fiberglass door may have a wood frame—all for stability and strength—and most will have some type of foam insulation to fill the interior voids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the materials has its pros and cons, and the versatility to achieve different styles, configurations, and finishes, including the look of woodgrain.</p>
<h4>Fiberglass front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fiberglass doors are a practical choice for most climates, particularly harsh or humid weather. They resist wear and tear extremely well. Available in smooth or embossed woodgrain texture, they can mimic the look of wood and take paint or stain. These doors are dent-resistant, require little maintenance, and typically come with a long warranty, from 20 years to a limited lifetime.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Can crack under severe impact.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $1,500</p>
<h4>Steel front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Steel doors are positioned as the strongest of doors. They will not crack or warp. Coated with a baked-on polyester finish, steel doors will require periodic repainting. Higher-end versions come with a vinyl finish for greater weather resistance. Some manufacturers offer a wood veneer or wood composite coating that can be stained.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Not as weather-resistant as fiberglass or wood doors. They are easy to dent, and dings are hard to fix. Scratches on steel doors may rust if not treated promptly. In extremely high temperatures, the surface can be hot to the touch.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Both steel and fiberglass doors should come with a thermal break that separates the inside and outside door skins. This prevents the transfer of outdoor heat and cold, which can cause frost to form on the inside surface.<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $200 &#8211; $2,000</p>
<h4>Wood front doors</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Pros</b></span>: Fans of wood front doors are drawn to its heritage of warmth and the versatility of different species. Wood resists cold and heat. Some wood doors are composed of veneer skin over an engineered wood core. This protects the core from moisture that causes shrinking, swelling, and warping. It’s also the least likely material to dent, and scratches are easy to repair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Cons</b></span>: Solid doors can be made through a millwork shop, lumberyard, and some door manufacturers, but they are expensive and time-consuming to complete. They also require regular upkeep—painting or varnishing to maintain their appearance—and a protected area in the shade or under an overhang.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Price range</b></span>: $175 &#8211; $2,600</p>
<h3>Decorative details for front doors</h3>
<p>The hardware—hinges, door handle—are practical, while also complementing your door style. Manufacturers will offer further options for customization with decorative glass, grilles, metal trim, and clavos (AKA, decorative door studs). Sidelights and/or a transom also lend visual interest while letting in more light. There’s plenty of choice within the glass category, too—clear, rain, satin, and geometric to name a few. And don’t forget the door knocker, even if you have a doorbell!</p>
<h3>Front door styles: Colors to consider</h3>
<p>A contrasting or complementary door color adds a touch of wit and drama to the entry. Try matching it to the window frames or shutters, if you have them, for a truly coordinated look. Or just go for it with one bold color for the door. Many manufacturers offer color as part of the door selection process, which saves you the trouble of painting. These finishes are formulated to be fade-resistant, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Picking the right front door can feel like a big commitment, and it is. But as with all the right relationships, it’s one that you can depend on and enjoy for many years.</p>
