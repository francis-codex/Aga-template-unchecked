<li><strong>Where:</strong> South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York</li>
<li><strong>Primary renovation:</strong> Top-to-bottom upgrades took the existing finishes in a grayed-out-modern, 668-square-foot studio from stark to a luxe-chic state of relaxed</li>
<li><strong>Notable:</strong> The remodel brought needed storage and stretch-out room to the narrow condo.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> A home towering with sleek touches and rich tones, and offering space for everything</li>

<p>It’s hard to say anything but yes to the job next door. “This project, right around the corner from our home and office, was the most convenient project we’ve done,” said Keren Richter, principal designer and founder, with husband and partner Thomas Richter, of <a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Arrow</a>. But that wasn’t the only <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/buying-renovating-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aspect of the condo</a>, part of a historic 19th-century building conversion in South Williamsburg, that drew them to the remodel. The lofted duplex, with its 19-foot ceilings and armspan-width, was unique in its shipping-tube configuration. And then there was the owner. Jared had stayed all over and sought to bring an alluring boutique-hotel vibe to the place.</p>
<p>“I’d been bouncing around between cities for a while—Amsterdam, San Francisco, back to New York City,” Jared said. “I wanted a place to call home, that would really be a sanctuary. I spoke with the design team about the aesthetics of spaces I loved, like SoHo Farmhouse, the Bowery Hotel, the Maritime in Chelsea, Brooklyn’s Wythe Hotel, the Freehold, the Clover Club, and the Walter.” The White Arrow duo was reeled in.</p>
<div></div>
<p>“We agreed we wanted to give the home the trappings of a sophisticated urban hotel,” Keren said. “It needed to be great for entertaining, hosting guests, relaxing and working,” which Jared, a digital agency founder, had been doing from home for years. The apartment, despite its high ceilings, was extremely narrow, with a ground-floor kitchen and living room that pushed the boundaries of its small footprint.</p>
<p>“Our goal was to make the home feel spacious and accentuate the positive,” Keren said. The walls, she explained, were a “disjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles,” including an inset stretch of exposed antique brick and a boxed-in, underutilized loft-bedroom platform. “We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display,” she added.</p>
<p>“Every square foot had to be well utilized,” Jared said. He wanted to add nooks and niches to put his things, and make the place truly feel like his own.</p>
<blockquote><p>We streamlined everything, reconsidering odd bumps as opportunities for storage and display</p></blockquote>
<p>The designers and their client also agreed that, instead of demolishing the place, they would elevate the existing finishes and fixtures. “We set out to minimize the rustic details the developer had selected during the conversion, and bring the home to a quiet level of cohesiveness with a new color palette,” Keren said.</p>
<p>Following White Arrow’s plan, their Sweeten general contractor streamlined the place’s odd juts and angles, and adding custom integrated display shelving in the kitchen as well as the home office-niche. Workers refinished the white-oak flooring with a more neutral, beige color tone and painted the dark exposed brick. “I knew I wanted lighter floors for a more Scandinavian aesthetic, but was wary of bleaching them,” Jared recalls. He trusted the team and has no regrets. Similarly, whitewashing the brick felt risky when the designers suggested it—but it “totally opened the room,” Jared said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45654" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg" alt="painted green cabinets" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-08-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>“Our client took some creative leaps,” Keren recalled. Repainting the gray kitchen cabinetry in a vivid green was a biggie. “The color is a total showstopper, and we are so glad he was game!” Keren remarked. Their Sweeten contractor retiled the kitchen backsplash with marble penny tile and changed all door hardware and plumbing fittings in the kitchen, as well as the two bathrooms, which got new grout and caulk, toilets, vanities, medicine cabinets, and fixtures.</p>
<p>Throughout the place, the contractors added new lighting locations and dimmer switches and swapped in new fixtures. “We added dramatic chandeliers and sconces that draw the eye up to take in the dramatic, high ceilings,” Keren said. “Living finishes” such as an unlacquered brass kitchen faucet, bring warmth and texture. A home-media specialist integrated a sound system and a wall-mounted TV.</p>
<p>It was with the furnishings that the designers really connected with the hotel aesthetic they strove for. “We chose distinctive, contemporary pieces in rich materials and jewel tones,” Keren said. Both Keren and Thomas were excited to shop and showcase an unusual mix of international designers, including Muller Van Severin, Gio Ponti, Atelier Areti, Harto, Maison Sarah Lavoine, Slash Objects, and Trnk. “We sought out furnishings that would do ‘double duty’ to maximize small spaces,” Keren said—sophisticated sofa beds, the secretary desk that Jared describes as “an ingenious space-saver.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>“Every piece,” Keren said, “is of the right proportion and scale,” including the king-size bed that Jared considered a must-have in the loft bedroom. The designers searched endlessly to find the furniture pieces that would allow every room to feel both luxurious and functional. To mellow the mood of the bedroom, Keren said, they added “a floor-to-ceiling, emerald-green velvet drapery to hide the formerly visible ensuite bath.”</p>
<p>The project had a fast turnaround, thanks to Sweeten’s vetting and follow-up during the project, Keren said. “The contractor was easy to work with and accommodating as the scope grew.”</p>
<p>As for the owner—Jared has been pleased to have his own digs to hunker down in during uncertain times. “The designs are super smart and well executed,” he says. “The living-room nook is discrete and conducive to relaxation. I am really happy.”</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Keren and Thomas of White Arrow, and Jared, for sharing the results of an inspired collaboration!</em></p>

<p><em><span class="s1">With a hair product line expanding in the U.S., London-based brand, Johnny’s Chop Shop settled on Williamsburg for its first American location. To start, Steven Ross decided to revamp a spot that was in complete disrepair and found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service to match him with a vetted general contractor. And to maintain a consistent message on brand, materials, and design, the majority of millwork and finishes, similar to those in the other locations, were fabricated in the U.K. and shipped stateside. The result: A barber shop that introduces the art of grooming to a new generation. </span></em></p>

As of this year, they are in 3,500 <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a> stores. We felt it was important to have a barber shop in the U.S. to strengthen the authenticity of the brand. Our first shop opened in London five years ago and we now have five locations.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> Where did the idea for the business come from?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> Barbering has been growing in popularity with the Millennials not only in visiting barber shops but in using products in their hair. I wanted to be part of that journey and create a brand that resonated with our target audience.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> We thought, “Where is the coolest city in the U.S.A.?” New York City was the answer. Then we asked what was the coolest neighborhood in the city, and of course, we came up with Williamsburg.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How does your new shop design represent your brand?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> I am passionate about design, and the influence for this new location is Americana with a modern twist and quite a few nods to England. </span><span class="s1">The tiger neon sign was brought in from the U.K. It has a very high wattage and needed a special transformer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How was your vision executed by working with your Sweeten general contractor? </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>Steven:</strong> Working in NYC is a far cry from working in the U.K. There are many more hurdles to get over in New York and is more expensive. I was lucky to stumble across the Sweeten site and find a contractor who has proven to be reliable, honest, and helpful.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When Vitoria, an art historian, and Jonathan, a location scout, purchased their 650-square-foot co-op in a century-old building in South Williamsburg, they began discussing renovations right away. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22955#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They posted their project</a> on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that matches homeowners with vetted general contractors, and were <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matched with a Sweeten contractor</a> to create a new home for the couple, daughter Asa, and Ramona, the family dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33753 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-04-1-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33563 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-08-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment was in &#8220;okay&#8221; shape, but it had little storage and the materials used were poor quality—laminate flooring and old Ikea cabinets. It would need a lot of updates along with better quality materials, such as kitchen countertops and new hardwood floors, but they were limited on budget and time. Some of their efforts went into looking ahead toward selling in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vitoria, who is inspired by the simplicity of Japanese design, envisioned uncluttered white space with lots of natural wood color. “Since we are growing a family in a small space, a place that looks tidy and serene was a priority. For us ‘negative space’ is actually positive,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33565 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-10-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33564 mb-0 size-chrono" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-09-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, living room, hardwood floors, natural wood" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>We replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood [so] the unevenness is barely noticeable.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;">Once the demo began, they were faced with a few surprises including rotten pipes in the kitchen sink and toilet and uneven floors. </span>Changing the floor was imperative. Vitoria said she had some “crazy ideas” to put in cork floors or use raw plywood cabinets in the kitchen, but then realized those materials would not increase the resale value and were too specific to her own personal taste. They opted instead for a pre-finished <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oak hardwood</a> which their contractor suggested. She admitted she was scared at first since the color of the boards varied quite a lot, but she soon fell in love. “The wood floor has so much personality!” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33754 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33567 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-01-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33566 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-03-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While redoing the subfloor in the bathroom, they decided not to renovate all the subflooring throughout the rest of the apartment to save time and money, &#8220;Since we replaced the cheap laminate with thick hardwood,&#8221; Vitoria said. &#8220;the unevenness is barely noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their Sweeten contractor helped with the layout of the kitchen, fitting in more storage with cabinets that were taller and deeper. They kept the stove and washer-and-dryer in the kitchen and purchased a new refrigerator. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/spice-rack-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrow cabinet for their spices</a> flanks the hood.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33568 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-02-723x482.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, hardwood floors, quartz countertop" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33569 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-04-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, kitchen, white cabinets, quartz countertop" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were a few &#8220;must-haves&#8221; on the couple&#8217;s list; in fact, Vitoria chose a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quartz countertop</a> before she even chose a contractor. “Quartz is a great material, especially for clumsy cooks like me,” she said. She also insisted on a Toto toilet and a slim Blomberg refrigerator. “These were non-negotiable. I had to have them!” Since the remodel, Vitoria said, “I actually have more space in the cabinets than I have things to put in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She also loved the idea of untreated pine for the open shelves above the sink to store what she called their “showpieces.&#8221; While visitors may think it’s yet to be painted, she is happy with the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33571 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-Before-01-723x1084.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg" width="723" height="1084" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33572 mb-0 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Vitoria-Hadba-Kitchen-AptUpdate-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="apartment renovation, Williamsburg, hexagon floor tile" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had a good working relationship with their contractor, who not only had a great personality but sourced materials that fit their taste and worked for resale while being adept at managing their budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When their contractor took up the bathroom floor, he discovered the original 100-year-old tiles, which were cracked and loose. He had to remove two layers of tile and redo the subfloor, which delayed the project by a couple of days. &#8220;Throughout the whole process, he was very aware that we had no wiggle room in the budget and was super cost-conscious. We are extremely grateful for that,&#8221; said Vitoria.</p>
<p>During the chaotic periods, they were glad to have Sweeten in their corner. Vitoria liked that Sweeten contacted her often during the renovation, commenting that it made her feel well taken care of and gave her peace of mind.</p>
<p>Post-renovation, Vitoria knows that there will always be unexpected issues no matter how good your contractor is or how fat your budget. “But having a home that you love makes it worth every penny spent,” she said. “Although my home is small, it feels spacious. I confess I only leave if I have to.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What is Fool’s Gold Records and how did the brand begin?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ben Jacobs, Fool&#8217;s Gold Records:</strong> The company was founded by two DJs, A-trak and Nick Catchdubs, as a Brooklyn-based record label in 2007. We&#8217;ve morphed into a retail brand and a bit of a marketing agency, but first and foremost we&#8217;re a record label.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26311 size-chrono" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-Before-07-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" />Original retail shop on Metropolitan Ave in Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: What led to the opening of a brick-and-mortar store?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We felt it was important to have a retail presence as an extension of the brand and the art that we create. Our first retail store and offices were actually in the same space on Metropolitan in Brooklyn. We were making tee shirts and either selling them online or tossing them off stage at shows. We decided, “Let’s take advantage of this space and open it up to the public.” It was a success and just came to a point where we outgrew it and it was a little too small to do enough with it. I happened to walk by this building—147 Grand Street—and saw a big open space for rent. The wheels started turning and we decided to come up with a new space that was more functional for how the brand was evolving.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How does your new retail space represent your brand? Why did you need to leave your former location? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> The old space was very narrow. Everything was fixed and there wasn’t much room to grow. The idea for the new space was not only to be bigger but a little bit more modular. For events, we have the flexibility to pull the podiums out or move the DJ booth over a bit. We’re doing art shows, workshops for kids, and DJ workshops—a range that ties into New York’s creative, arts and music community.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26248 size-chrono" title="DJ booth" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-03-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26252 size-chrono" title="retail shop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How was your vision executed by working with Sweeten? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> I worked closely with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Sweeten contractor</a> who did the work to make the space a reality. We had a pretty defined concept visually, but it was a bit up in the air in terms of how we were going to execute it. These enfilades that we’re sitting under, these three structures, were an experiment. We had to figure out how we were going to get the polycarbonate to stand and be sturdy and supported during events. Due to the nature of a lot of the materials we selected, there was a fair amount of trial and error and I appreciated the contractor&#8217;s willingness to experiment until we found the right methods and his patience throughout the process. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #d8bc3a;">&#8220;The enfilades were a simple way to get a strong view right when you walk in. It also takes all the aspects of Fool&#8217;s Gold and puts them on display individually, sort of like laying out the ingredients for a recipe.&#8221; &#8211; Designer Dong-Ping Wong</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten: How did you, as a client, work with Sweeten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR: </strong>We found Sweeten through our designer, Family New York. I definitely noticed how quickly and efficiently we were able to get bids and that it wasn’t a disjointed process. From the receiving end, it was like, “Wow! We’ve got a lot of general contracting options here, and a lot of good people who are interested in this job. Great!” It simplified the process and gave us a very strict and transparent way of comparing our options and what’s out there. During the renovation, there was a lot of communication with our Sweeten contractor—emails, calls, weekly meetings. He was very involved in the process and genuinely concerned with making sure it turned out exactly as we were hoping.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26259 size-chrono" title="office" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-12-723x482.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="482" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26258 size-chrono" title="conference room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DongPing_Store-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="commercial renovations" width="723" height="1085" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sweeten:</strong> How do you think Sweeten can help small business owners like yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FGR:</strong> Sweeten helps business owners by simplifying and demystifying the process a bit. It’s pretty daunting if you’ve never been through the renovation process before. So you&#8217;ll have questions like, “Where do I start? What are the first steps? When do I know I’m done?” All these different questions you have going into it kind of blind. It definitely takes a bit of the edge off of figuring out what to do and if you’re feeling a little bit lost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2005, a condo conversion gave Felix the opportunity to buy an apartment in the Williamsburg building where she had rented for three years. Although she considered renovating the spacious but “grim” rental-grade bathroom at the time, she procrastinated…for over a decade. It wasn’t until 2016 that she pulled the trigger, but the results were well worth the wait. With a bright new master bathroom, a brand new extra powder room, a washer/dryer closet, and an entryway closet, the project incorporated clean lines and Scandinavian-inspired design throughout the new spaces that blended seamlessly with the loft-style apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21113 mb-0 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Portrait.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-21076"></span>Fun fact: before moving into her current space, Felix lived in an identical apartment two stories above. She was one of the few residents who remained through the conversion, and as the 12-unit building emptied out, the sponsors told her that she could look around and have her pick of the lot. Felix chose to purchase on the third floor with the future in mind: although she didn’t yet have kids, she was hoping to, and a fifth-floor walkup with a baby sounded unrealistic. Given the nearly-empty building, she was also in the unique position of being able to slowly move all her belongings from one apartment to the other, placing her furniture in the exact same location—just two floors down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In early 2015, Felix started thinking renovations again. She now had a daughter, Nova, and while the 1,500-square foot apartment provided plenty of space for the duo, the bathroom update was long overdue, and storage space in the entryway was lacking, so a new closet was also in order. A powder room would be a much-appreciated addition, given that they had room for guests and a third bedroom might be added down the line. Last—but certainly not least—Felix wanted to include a washer/dryer to the scope of her project. When a Google search led her to Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted her project</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now you might be wondering why a whole year lapsed between Felix posting the project, and the project breaking ground. This is a story of perseverance paying off: <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Alan</a>, who Felix chose from several Sweeten matches, patiently checked in with Felix over the course of the next dozen months as she updated and changed the details of the renovation. “We were laughing about it, because it was really just shy of a year of us meeting [for the first time] and me pulling the trigger,” Felix recalled. “That was really why I went with him—he stuck with me through the procrastination!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21094 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-05" width="600" height="899" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21092 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02-600x899.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-02" width="600" height="899" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once Felix signed on the dotted line, things picked up pace. Alan was helpful in the planning stages by assisting her in decision-making about layout, materials, and finishes. She would send him links and he gave feedback about whether a choice might work. Felix and Alan also worked together to carve up what once was open, under-utilized space right outside of the original bathroom. They physically mapped out where walls would go for the new half-bath and closets, and worked with the building&#8217;s condo board and architect to review the plans and work through permit filing requirements. <span id="m_4274900948712308356gmail-m_-4912132230132608472m_-173239267599755632m_3764308559695335903m_-8103665152874927754m_-6452857499375953401m_-3861732466284412182gmail-m_1969148704937432351m_7319843981009065494gmail-m_-8045206210142907377gmail-docs-internal-guid-4a6a0646-b1cd-4c67-2385-bb691e742e01" class="gmail_msg"></span>Inside the existing full bath, they decided to keep both the sink and the toilet in the original location, but moved the tub slightly to make room for an extra linen closet behind the bathroom door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Felix’s original vision of a “Scandinavian feel” was brought to life through gray and white finishes with wood and colorful accents. In the full bath, Felix chose a gray slate tile for the floor, to contrast against the white bathtub, toilet, and vanity. For the walls, she chose a matte white subway tile from Nemo Tile, intending to lay it horizontally, but changed direction when she realized that the tile fit perfectly along the tub when laid vertically. A glass partition maintains the overall minimalist look. Alan’s team recessed a large mirrored medicine cabinet into the wall, providing ample storage. Felix also appreciated that the understated palette of the permanent fixtures meant that she could change out bright hooks and towels without having to worry about clashing colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the powder room, Felix carried through the same minimal design and materials, with wall-mounted fixtures that maximize floor space. Although the decision to wall-mount the toilet complemented the overall design, it was borne of necessity: during demo, Alan discovered that a steel beam ran through the floor where the toilet would have stood, making it impossible to run the necessary plumbing. He made use of his extensive network and had a different model delivered with minimal delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21091 mb-24 size-large" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01-600x401.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-Before-01" width="600" height="401" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21119 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08-723x1100.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-08" width="723" height="1100" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21120 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-09" width="723" height="1085" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21128 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_Felix_Bathroom-10-12-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-21129" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif" alt="Sweeten-Felix-closet1" width="723" height="1085" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1.gif 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sweeten-Felix-closet1-200x300.gif 200w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The steel beam beneath the powder room was the only major obstacle in a process that otherwise went smoothly and quickly, with Felix and Nova displaced from their apartment for just under two months. Alan’s team cordoned off the renovation zone to keep dust from invading the rest of the apartment (see <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/8-ways-minimize-mess-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> on how to minimize mess during construction), and kept it tidy throughout the duration of the project. While construction was underway, Felix would stop by the work site daily to check in and to answer any questions the team had. “But pretty much Alan knew what I wanted,” Felix explained. (This may have had something to do with the fact that they had been talking about this project for 12 months!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that Felix and Nova have moved back into the loft, they are thoroughly enjoying the updates. In particular, the stacked washer/dryer has been a “life changer,” and they now have space for coats as well as odds and ends like the vacuum cleaner in the new entryway closet. The baths provide a spa-like experience with plentiful storage, but remain beautifully simple. Felix loves her new space but does have a minor regret—she wishes that she had had the foresight to hang the medicine cabinet in the full bath a bit higher so that she could open the doors without knocking over bottles sitting on the back ledge of the sink. Overall, however, Felix found the renovation process to be “surprisingly easy,” even for a first-time renovator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to Felix and Nova for sharing their space—we’re so glad you decided to go for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>When advertising executives Lia and Chris Wollen made the leap to homeownership, they didn’t have to go far. A waterfront condo, just four blocks from their Williamsburg rental, called to them with bridge views and appealing amenities. After envisioning the possibility of a townhouse, square footage in the two-bedroom was a concern, but with a stunning kitchen and bathroom renovation, plus strategic spending and saving in a few key spots, Sweeten helped them make this home their own (with time to spare for the arrival of a new baby this winter!). Read on for Lia’s take on this beautiful project.</em></p>

</span>Guest post by Williamsburg homeowner Lia Wollen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After three years of renting in Williamsburg, the time came to try and buy a place. My husband, Chris, and I hoped to find a spacious townhouse or something bigger than our current place. Planning for a family and wanting outdoor space, we felt that broadening our search to less trendy neighborhoods was our only option. After exploring most of Brooklyn, however, we found that we kept coming back to Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six months into our search, standing just four blocks south of our rental and looking out at the East River from the roof deck of a two-bedroom on the market, Chris said, “Well, if we can do this, then I want this.” It was a top floor unit with a small terrace off the living room, high ceilings, tons of light, and views of the Domino Sugar Factory, the river, and Manhattan. It came with basement storage, a parking space, and a piece of the private roof deck. Square footage was a concern, and we agreed that we would have to do a renovation before moving in to accommodate long-term needs, but first, the offer. Ours was accepted.</p>
<p>I found Sweeten in a general contractor search online and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filled out the project post form</a> to be matched with general contractors. Not too long after that initial search, I saw a blog post like this one, of <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/coreys-williamsburg-kitchen-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another gorgeous Sweeten renovation</a>. One of the photos looked right out at the Domino Sugar Factory—a replica of our new view! I realized pretty quickly it was a condo from our building and emailed Sweeten to ask them for the contractor. They connected us with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten general contractor</a>. We met with him to kick things off and were thrilled with the fit and his vision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56286 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg" alt="Kitchen before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56285 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg" alt="Bathroom before renovation" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The focus of our renovation was the kitchen and bath. I love to cook and wanted a hard-working, welcoming space to gather in. The bathroom needed a feeling of calm, an escape from the city. Our contractor was strategic with us in his approach. He started big so that we could see the possibilities, and then collectively, we pulled each other back to set reasonable expectations. This process was critical when it came to prioritizing our wants and needs and managing the dollars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We underestimated the significance of overall design in renovating, but it was the beautiful and technical unifier underneath everything we were trying to accomplish. The contractor addressed the kitchen simply: hide the fridge, fill in the odd angles and edges of the ceiling, and provide more counter/storage space. This blew our minds. It cleaned up the whole space and looked like a kitchen that meant to be there, rather than an afterthought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The most exciting proposal from our contractor was to open up the ceiling and expose building beams that were encased in the walls of the kitchen and living room. This eliminated awkward lines and revealed some industrial elements, playing off of the raw materials mirrored across the street at Domino. We achieved separation of living room and kitchen while retaining warmth in the space, by limiting how far we (and our budget) extended the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another small but important detail was the flooring. The contractor and his team buffed out the overly lacquered yellow floors to get back down to raw wood, and we chose a sky gray matte stain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were other more indulgent decisions made during the planning process, like a wine fridge. This felt like a low-cost, high-impact amenity you don’t typically get in the city and we were very excited about it. Chris insisted from day one that we have a garbage disposal, so that was non-negotiable. We also debated and ultimately agreed to a waterfall edge for the kitchen countertops. Our contractor had strongly recommended this as a focal point when entering the home, and he was absolutely right.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="mb-24 alignnone wp-image-56288 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg" alt="Candid shot of Lia in her kitchen renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56292 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg" alt="Sweeten homeowners in their space renovated with Sweeten" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the bath, we kept the tub, sink, and hardware, but had everything retiled. We used leftover marble from the kitchen for the tub and installed a glass shower partition to open up the small space. We also built a new medicine cabinet and drawer for the sink to accommodate storage, and I found some new light fixtures to modern it up a bit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and I have a very similar aesthetic, so choosing materials, appliances, and fixtures was pretty straightforward. Before construction, I spent a lot of time pulling looks and materials from home and design websites, so we had a strong point of view right away. My must-have was a Wolf Range with the iconic red knobs. Snobby, kinda, but an important design element in an otherwise minimalist kitchen. The thing is also a weapon! (Chris started a grease fire the first time we used it.) Keeping in line with the stainless steel, we also bought a new Bosch dishwasher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Material choices included Carrara marble, beveled and plain white subway tile with dark grout, classic New York hex tile in the bath, Edison bulbs, and glossy white cabinets. We chose IKEA cabinets because of another Sweeten renovation I caught on Instagram. It was very important to me that the cabinets went as high as they could go. I wanted an excess of clean-looking storage space and was not interested in dusting open shelving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-56287 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg" alt="Portrait of the Sweeten homeowners in their renovated kitchen" width="1000" height="1494" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6638-Lia-Bathroom-01-600x896.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were easy-going clients who trusted our contractor and his vision. We made things easier by not changing our minds and being open to his direction when we were undecided on something. The biggest decision, which we labored over the longest, was whether or not the kitchen should remain galley-style. The choice is obvious now, but there was something tempting at the time about toeing that suburban-house line with a big island to gather around. After the renovation, any concerns with square footage more or less went away. More, because we made so much out of what existed, and less because in March we found out we are expecting a baby boy this month!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21207 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-1-723x469.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="469" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin came to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> to find a design/build contracting team after a long search for a move-in ready pad in Williamsburg. He’d scoured New York’s ultra-competitive market for months and landed a charming but worn floor-through unit in a Graham Avenue co-op. The building was a century old and his unit hadn’t been touched since the ‘70s—but with high ceilings and old bones, Austin saw the many cons as potential pros: here was his chance to grab a well-located, window-filled blank slate and start anew. Austin <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project on Sweeten</a> and planned to put between $100,000 and $150,000 into the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a first-time renovator who spends his days as a consultant for media and cable groups, a full renovation game plan was admittedly ambitious. Sweeten introduced Austin to a contractor to create a sunny and spacious space that maximized every bit of square footage. One of Austin’s guiding goals was to make an apartment that anyone could enjoy, so he opted for a minimalist approach in a neutral color palette. To create the open and airy feeling that Austin was after, the contractors weighed in with suggestions for modern finishes and monochromatic tones that would unite the space and keep the focus on natural light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14998" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment_Before-01-4-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin and his Sweeten contractor team managed an incredible feat: with one single design choice, he brought an entirely new feel to the entire space. Matte-finish wide-plank hardwood flooring, and not all that much else, now sets the tone in this serene bedroom and throughout the living areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14984" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-07-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14982" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-05-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14991" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-14-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To create the kitchen, the team focused on making the most of a slightly slim layout. They swapped the former kitchen space into the living room and turned what was formally a bedroom into a new slim kitchen. They maximized its narrow footprint with all food prep and storage along one wall and then connected the space to the rest of the unit with French doors and glass panel details. Austin chose a very dark soapstone countertop with light marbling &#8211; a stand-out feature that is low maintenance and impervious to acid, bases, and heat. A custom table from <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Room and Board</a> turns the room into a hangout spot and pulls double-duty as both breakfast nook and workspace.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bathroom showcases a blend of the old world and new, with a mosaic hexagon marble tile floor paired with more contemporary limestone on the walls. Couple that with a sprawling vanity and a stacked washer/dryer, and the project started to feel complete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14978" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-01.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-01" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-01.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/SWEETEN_Austin_Apartment-01-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Austin initially worried that the process would be daunting, but thanks to regular check-ins and tech-savvy partners, the crew kept the project on time and on budget, even when surprise issues like termite damage came up. Since he was often traveling for work, his Sweeten contractors instituted regular check-ins and created a DropBox to share images of the progress with Austin, right down to snapshots of the inside of his insulated floors.</p>

Guest post by Corey, Williamsburg homeowner</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Burned out by a decade of renting in the city, we entered the buyer’s market with little knowledge of how volatile it would be. After a search that saw us move too slowly on a modest but well-located unit, and then get completely outbid on a dream apartment, we stumbled upon a two-bed, two-bath condo in Williamsburg. Not wanting to miss out again, we put in a bid and were surprised to get the place. That could very well have been the end of the story, but what fun would that be?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’d be the first to admit that the unit we purchased was totally serviceable. Only a few years old, it was a corner apartment with decent square footage and great city/bridge views in an increasingly popular zip code. The unit had been rented to a prolific painter who’d kept the walls white and the creativity high. It was a serviceable blank canvas; what it wasn’t was the dream apartment we’d lost out on months earlier. Regardless of how excited we were to be new owners, we just couldn’t shake the “if only&#8230;” feeling for that spot and started thinking about ways to incorporate elements from the coveted (but now somebody else’s) space into our new home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had no idea where to start, but after a search on New York renovations, I stumbled upon <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> and spent a few days ghost-stalking various featured projects on the site. This gave me many ideas and the more we explored changes for our space, the bigger the scope of this potential project became, so we decided to focus on the area that could make the biggest impact: the kitchen. As it was, the apartment opened into a cramped one with little countertop space, limited storage, basic appliances, and no defined dining area. There was unused space above the cabinets and an odd mixture of lighting fixtures. In a nutshell, it was a cookie cutter kitchen in a cookie cutter condo and we really wanted something with more character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13107" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png" alt="SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE" width="600" height="225" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SWEETEN_CoreyKitchen-00-BEFORE-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I put together a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/2075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project post on Sweeten</a> with a fairly clear idea of the feeling we wanted the place to evoke, even if the specifics weren’t totally defined. Sweeten introduced us to a few design teams and we decided to work with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten Expert Thomas</a> and his design/build team based on images of some of the spaces they had designed in Little Italy. We had them come out to the apartment to see what we had and right away, the team showed enthusiasm for the project and the type of aesthetic we were hoping to achieve. In hindsight, that was probably the most important decision we made &#8211; identifying the team that seemed to best understand the vision we had and showed a willingness to get us there (and stay within our budget) was key.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thomas&#8217;s team introduced us to their design/build approach and though I had no experience with the model, it became clear we would be working very closely to get the space just the way we wanted it. But what was that, exactly? Aside from being slight on storage and functionality, our complaint was that the kitchen was generic, so looking to the neighborhood for inspiration, we envisioned a design that embraced the industrial history of the area without being too rustic. We also wanted to maximize the space by creating a more open floor plan. Through conversations with the design team, we zeroed in on a classic palette incorporating white, gray, brown, charcoal, black, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palette aside, there was little hope of gaining storage or making the space feel more open without a pretty drastic change to the layout. Thomas and his team walked us through possible reconfigurations; we entertained the idea of installing an island or lengthening the counter, but because of the central placement of the sink and dishwasher, the only way to address the problem was to relocate both. Cue the plumber. The upside? We were able to position the sink in front of the window (where it probably should have been in the first place?) and create a longer countertop surface as well as additional storage both above and below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the devil is in the details and we learned this firsthand once the floor plan had been chosen and the time came to fill it. We have an admittedly eclectic style so the conversations about materials were lengthy and the direction of the design changed a few times. We went in knowing we liked metal, glass, tile and wood because they suggested the “industrial” feel we liked, but it was most important that we assembled comfortable and clean materials. We knew we wanted appliances that would allow for entertaining and easy food prep and a look that would match, so a lot of time was spent narrowing down the colors of the tile and millwork and countertop and shopping for new appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the design/build process, we were able to combine an <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA</a> pre-built cabinet base system with custom doors, buffed and polished to create a bespoke look &#8211; a color that did not exist before we requested it! We finished the cabinetry with hardware from <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropologie</a> and found the backsplash tile at <a href="https://www.nemotile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nemo Tile</a>. Thomas added open shelving repurposed from wood that his team sourced, and complemented the look with a decorative but spare hanging pendant from <a href="https://www.abchome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC Carpet and Home</a>. The dishwasher, range, and fridge are all <a href="https://www.vikingrange.com/consumer/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viking</a>. We found the table and benches at ABC Home before we bought this place and love how they work here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many things about the design that I love, and each component is like a puzzle piece that connects to a memory. The feature that I still find the most exciting is the countertop. Once we knew we’d be relocating the sink, and nearly doubling the counter surface area in the process, I knew it was critical to choose the right material as it would be prominently featured. Thomas had shown us a space they were finishing with a soapstone countertop and we inquired about the possibility of doing that in our space. They were more than willing to help us make that work and took us out to their supplier’s stoneyard to look at slabs. While there, we saw the integrated countertop/sink configuration on display and were sold. We also opted for a “waterfall” edge which helped distinguish the kitchen/dining areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I would be lying if I said it was all completely painless, but as I look back, it’s obvious that every trial we ran across, whether it be plumbing surprises or tile irregularities or whatever, we chose a design firm committed to making good on our contract together. They were as invested as we were in seeing the space come out the way we wanted and along the way the team at Sweeten (Jean and Shera) were both very much in the loop and always asking how they could assist. I doubt I will embark on another renovation anytime in the near future but if I did, I’d certainly return to Sweeten and would recommend them to anyone looking to transform their home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Thanks, Corey, for this tour of your gorgeous kitchen and for your thoughtful recollections of the journey.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Around the end of last year, Elliot, a Graphic Designer, and Katie, a Benefit Specialist, decided that the time had come to take the scary but sensible plunge and become first-time homeowners of an older 1,800 sq/ft, 2-story townhouse in Williamsburg. The couple fell in love with this house&#8217;s lovely bones, plus it had a backyard for their dog, Desmond; but what they did not love was that it had the common NYC problem of disjointed spaces caused by a layout of many smaller rooms, not to mention the interior&#8217;s outdated <em><span style="color: #000000;">everything</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the couple had never done a renovation before, they were excited by the idea of fixing up an older home. So the next task was to find their general contractor, which wouldn&#8217;t be easy (they thought) since they didn&#8217;t know many other homeowners, and therefore word-of-mouth was out of the question. After hearing about our resources at Sweeten, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katie &amp; Elliot posted their project</a> right away to get matched with members of the Sweeten Network. After comparing their matches, the young homeowners chose to put their project in the trustworthy hands of <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/228#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Sweeten general contractor</a> focused on sustainable design-building. The contractor worked with the renovation newbies to think through everything from the practicality of materials to overall design concepts, before beginning construction on their 4-month project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Katie &amp; Elliot&#8217;s first order of business was to re-do the kitchen so that they could finally enjoy eating-in, as much as they do dining out at their favorite neighborhood spot. Ecostruct enlarged the space by opening up existing entranceways and creating larger floor-to-ceiling cabinet systems. During demolition, Ecostruct&#8217;s team, lead by Jon Eklund, found that the existing plumbing needed to be replaced because it was not up to code (and was actually a ticking time bomb inside their walls). This added some extra time, expenses, and maybe a few gray hairs to the project, but both the homeowners and Jon&#8217;s team were confident that it was a problem worth solving right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10653 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10654 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10655 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, Elliot and Katie have similar taste when it comes to interiors. The couple wanted to create a home that had a warm, clean and modern feel with plenty of light. For the kitchen, they choose to use both recessed lighting and Caravaggio Matte Grey Pendant Lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10656 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/07_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon helped Elliot and Katie think about the new materials in terms of cost, aesthetics and sustainability &#8211; triple bonus! The couple picked Caesarstone in White Farina for their countertops which is known not just for its simplified fabrication and installation process that makes it budget-friendly, but also for its nonporous and scratch resistant qualities which will help it retain a perfect surface without sealants or waxes, keeping harmful toxins out of the home. For the floors, the couple went with Mirage Knotty Walnut floors throughout the living room, open kitchen and dining room. The wood adds nice warmth to the space and its natural irregularities make a nice contrast with the white clean lines of their kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10657 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08a_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10658 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08b_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it was the mix of mid-90’s earth toned floor-to-ceiling tiles, black accented toilet seat, or the fact that the faulty old pipes in the walls were about to bust open, updating this bathroom was a must. I loved how, by continuing with the same color palette and general clean aesthetic of the adjacent kitchen, the bathroom  now reads as an integrated part of the home and less of a time warp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10659 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/09_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is tied both aesthetically and visually by opening up the island and updating the dry bar so the ever so hospitable Katie or Elliot can do what they do best, serve their lucky guests a cocktail while cooking up a meal in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10666 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png" alt="williamsburg townhouse renovation" width="600" height="902" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-200x300.png 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/10_SWEETEN_Ecostruct-LeonardSt1-599x900.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the entry foyer, the homeowners had Jon&#8217;s team replace the front door and repaint the concrete flooring and wood staircase; they also hung a nice big <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/park-slope-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mirror that looks pretty familiar</a>. I really like the shabby-chic but very gender-neutral vibe of the foyer, which I&#8217;m sure is making many great first impressions for the Katie and Elliot&#8217;s visiting friends and family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks and congrats to Katie and Elliot! And a big thanks to Jon and his team at Ecostruct!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We are ultimately focused on the tangible components and how they contribute to the experience of a project, which allows conceptual designs to be realized within actual parameters of budget and resources.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Bryan Young, Principal at Young Projects</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re pleased to introduce one of theSweeten&#8217;s newest members, DUMBO-based architecture studio, Young Projects. Firm principal Bryan Young (photographed above) launched his practice in 2010, and in just 3 years, the small team has rallied some big achievements, including last month&#8217;s award of the <a href="https://archleague.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 Architectural League Prize</a>. In practice, the team pursues unique considerations of materiality, assembly, &amp; craft through a method of experimentation that embraces all levels of technology; the resulting architecture, while stylistically modern, elicits qualities of warmth &amp; tactility. We were interested in learning more about Young Projects&#8217; work, so we met up with Bryan on the site of a project that is currently under construction in Williamsburg, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolios/Gut-Renovation/Photographer-s-Townhouse-Williamsburg-Brooklyn-NY/602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="graphic-rendering-of-two-storey-house"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48042 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg" alt="3d graphic rendering of a two storey house backyard with swimming pool before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse project is a gut renovation &amp; new addition to an existing, 2,300 sqft masonry townhouse. The century-old building had deteriorated to a state of disrepair before it was purchased by a local photographer. After a thoughtful collaboration between the Young Projects team and the homeowner, the first phase of construction began earlier this year. On site, Bryan walked us through some of the highlights of the project design and development. One of the most prominent features of the new design is the exterior; by their use of materials, the designers have created a strong juxaposition between the old, restored brick facade, and the new addition &#8212; an elevated mass behind a screen of perforated, corrugated zinc. You can see the exterior in the above rendering.<span id="more-8739"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="2d-design-rendering"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48038" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg" alt="2d design rendering of a two storey-house" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This section drawing gave us an idea of the proposed interior space. Unlike the sharp contrast on the exterior, the distinction between old and new is more subtle on the interior &#8212; a &#8216;conceptual fault line&#8217; creates a slip in the floor level at the intersection of the old &amp; new zones. On a functional level, by elevating the addition, the designers provide space for parking. With this arrangement, the back yard is replaced by a series of rooftop courtyards that will allow the perfect amount of privacy on the corner lot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="room-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48041 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg" alt="photo of a room with beams during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, on site, we&#8217;re standing near the center of the old townhouse looking toward the back where the new addition will be constructed. A large portion of the ceiling overhead will be opened up for a glimpse at one of the landscaped courtyards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="design-illustration-of-dining-living-rooms"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48039 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2.jpg" alt="3d graphic rendering of open dining and living rooms before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This rendering is what we would see from where we&#8217;re standing in the photo above. Here you can see the changes in the floor height, indicating where the new addition begins. Opposite what we saw on the exterior, the designers have created continuity across the slip with the conscious use of materials, so that on the interior, we read the old &amp; new as a fluid space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="townhouse-exterior-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48044 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg" alt="three storey townhouse exterior during renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the old masonry building, the construction crew started prepping the foundation for the new addition. Construction here will take some time, but we&#8217;re excited to follow along as the new home takes shape!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we thought we&#8217;d head over to the Young Projects studio in DUMBO to check out what else the designers are up to &#8212; what we found really highlighted how adaptable the Young Projects approach is for meeting different types of design challenges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="sweeten-team-members"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48040 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-3.jpg" alt="the sweeten team at work" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole team was hard at work when we arrived at their sunny loft office! The space was filled with material samples, models, mock-ups, sketches, experiments and printouts, showcasing their iterative design process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="various-graphic-rendering-images"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48043 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6.jpg" alt="four different graphic rendering images of two storey house and plywood before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were drawn to a large site model and renderings along one wall in the space, which Bryan explained are from a project that will move to construction later this year, the Playa Grande Retreat. The retreat will be the vacation home for a NYC-based family, with a program that includes a main house, 3 guest bungalows and a kiva for special events, all on a 6.5 acre beachfront site in the Dominican jungle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="graphic-rendering-of-two-storey-house"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8.jpg" alt="3d backyard design illustration of a two storey house before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rendering above shows a view from a path leading to the main house. The designers followed to the natural topography and landscape of the site in order to generate forms, structure &amp; pathways, as well as experiences of the site &amp; views.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Directed by solar orientation, natural ventilation and the desire to preserve all existing trees and vegetation, the evolved form is a drifting ring that shifts in plan and section just below the jungle’s canopy. The roof is a ruled surface requiring over 200 scissor trusses; each is dimensionally unique, but simple in joinery and construction.&#8221;</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A historic paper doily factory gets a new look</h2>
<p>Back in May we gave a <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-projects-to-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very early preview</a> of some longer-term projects that we were excited to follow through construction. After a suspenseful few months, we&#8217;re back with Adam Glickman &amp; Lauren Schlesinger of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSDO</a> to check out the progress of their conversion of a historic paper doily factory located in South Williamsburg. The former doily mill is well on its way to becoming the new home of the <a href="https://www.wnns.org/donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Williamsburg Neighborhood Nursery School</a> and will also house two apartments on its upper level. Here&#8217;s a last look into the project before the finishing touches are completed and the final results are revealed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38332 mb-24 size-chrono" title="01_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8863-e1544468926618-723x964.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8863-e1544468926618-723x964.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8863-e1544468926618-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8863-e1544468926618-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> The nursery school entry &#8212; Adam &amp; Lauren chose a pair of playful pendant lights for the school&#8217;s entry space; the pendants have an industrial quality while remaining kid-friendly in yellow rubber. The fixtures are by <a href="https://muuto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form Us with Love for Muuto</a>.<span id="more-4427"></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38333 mb-24 size-chrono" title="02_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8867-e1544468958539-723x964.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8867-e1544468958539-723x964.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8867-e1544468958539-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8867-e1544468958539-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> Another playful touch is the circular ceiling fixtures that run throughout the nursery school; these were manufactured locally by <a href="https://lightingfixtures.lamarlighting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaMar</a>. Adam &amp; Lauren got the idea from their young daughter who recently started saying &#8220;circle!&#8221;  Rather than using color on the classroom walls, the school went with a neutral white scheme in order to better display the students&#8217; work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38334 mb-24 size-chrono" title="03_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8886-723x542.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="542" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8886-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8886-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8886-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />The two classrooms for 3-year-olds are connected by large pocket doors so that some activities can be easily shared.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38335 mb-24 size-chrono" title="04_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8905-723x542.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="542" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8905-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8905-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8905-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> Upstairs, the first apartment is an open 1,340 sqft with lots of light and a blend of clean-modern &amp; old-industrial character.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38336 mb-24 size-chrono" title="05_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8901-723x964.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8901-723x964.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8901-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8901-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />The white IKEA cabinets and subway tiles in the kitchen keep it clean and simple.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38337 mb-24 size-chrono" title="06_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8938-723x542.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="542" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8938-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8938-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8938-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />The second space is a 1,725 sqft two-bedroom apartment. Here is a look into the open living space where an original skylight opening had been reintroduced by GSDO in order to help satisfy NYC building code requirements for air and light.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38338 mb-24 size-chrono" title="07_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8946-723x542.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="542" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8946-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8946-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8946-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /> The designers integrated the ductwork, track lighting, and sprinklers into the ceiling joists in order to minimize their appearance in this apartment. In the first apartment, they took an opposite, celebratory approach to the HVAC and sprinkler layout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-38339 mb-24 size-chrono" title="08_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8940-723x542.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="542" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8940-723x542.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8940-300x225.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8940-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" />This open kitchen/living layout would make a perfect space for entertaining.</p>
<div id="attachment_38340" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38340" class="wp-image-38340 mb-10 size-chrono" title="09_theSweeten_GSDO_nursery2" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8960-723x964.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="964" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8960-723x964.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8960-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/IMG_8960-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><p id="caption-attachment-38340" class="wp-caption-text">Another set of ikea cabinets in the second kitchen which features a more colorful scheme, using blue backsplash tiles from <a href="https://ceramicabardelli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ceramica Bardelli</a> in Italy and a grey lava stone countertop from <a href="https://www.mondialtiles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mondial Tile</a> in Brooklyn.</p></div>
<p>Many thanks to Lauren &amp; Adam at GSDO, we can&#8217;t wait to see the final reveal!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we met up with Nick Dillon and his crew at Nick Knacks Creative Interiors. The guys are off to a good start on this residential lighting project in South Williamsburg, which they were awarded via <a href="http://sweeten.com">Sweeten</a>. For the homeowners, a thorough revamp of the lighting scheme in their 1400 sqft home all started with one dark closet. In addition to the closet, not a single one of their 3 bedrooms nor the living and dining spaces was equipped with overhead lighting. Nick worked closely with the homeowners to come up with the best lighting solutions for each space. In order to finish the job, they&#8217;ll also be replacing the existing, standard ceiling-mounted hallway fixtures with something a little more stylish.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/01_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3821" title="01_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/01_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/01_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/01_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s Nick, owner of Nick Knack&#8217;s Creative Interiors, showing off a microphone-style track fixture. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/02_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3822" title="02_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/02_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/02_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/02_theSweeten_NickKnacks-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>As we saw in an <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/site-visit-w-nick-knacks-creative-interiors-2/">earlier post</a>, Nick is serious about his prep work in order to protect his clients&#8217; homes and belongings while the tools are out. Here he is on day 1 prepping the guest bedroom with one of his crew members.<span id="more-3820"></span> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3823" title="03_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s an example of a dark corner in the living space that really needed some overhead light. Nick helped the homeowners come up with a track light system that will fit the space perfectly. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3824" title="04_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/04_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>The team started work in the living and dining areas. In only a matter of a few hours they&#8217;d drawn electricity through to the new 3-way switches and fixture locations, and by the end of the first day the tracks were already installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3825" title="05_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/05_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Here&#8217;s where they added a switch location and have drawn power through. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3826" title="06_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/06_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>We loved the brushed steel tracks &amp; fixtures these homeowners chose for the living room. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3827" title="07_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/07_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Nick suggested 3-way switches for the spacious, open living / dining space, and they installed these Lutron Maestro digital dimmers (600 Watts). <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3828" title="08_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/08_theSweeten_NickKnacks-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>On our second visit we could see more of Nick&#8217;s systematic style. Back in the dining space, the guys had installed &#8220;pigtail&#8221; lamps in place of the future fixture, which will be an industrial-style chandelier from Rejuvenation. Nick said these dangling pigtail lights represent where the new electrical connections had been made and properly secured. Next, the cuts to the ceiling (and walls) will need to be patched with drywall, then plastered and painted, before the final fixtures are installed. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3829" title="09_theSweeten_NickKnacks" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="747" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/09_theSweeten_NickKnacks1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>After the living / dining spaces, Nick and his crew moved into the guest bedroom and office, leaving more pigtails behind until the ceiling has been mended.</p>
<p>At this point, they&#8217;re almost halfway finished with this 7-day job. Next they&#8217;ll be working on a new entryway chandelier and the master bedroom. We can&#8217;t wait to see all the new fixtures installed!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we&#8217;re previewing a couple of projects being completed by members of theSweeten network. Both renovations are still early on in the construction phase, but we&#8217;re so excited about them that we had to share!</p>
<p>First up is this retrofit with <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSDO</a> (you may remember their awesome work from this post). Adam Glickman &amp; Lauren Schlesinger invited us out to Williamsburg to check out the progress on their adaptive re-use of a former Paper Doily Factory. The 7,000 sqft structure will soon have two apartments on the upper level; the new home of the <a href="https://www.wnns.org/donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Williamsburg Neighborhood Nursery School</a> will be on the ground floor.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3482 mb-24" title="560_GSDO_00" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/560_GSDO_00-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Lauren &amp; Adam of GSDO <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3450 mb-24" title="GSDO_01" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GSDO_01-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Everyone was hard at work on the nursery school &#8212; soon this space will be full of 4 year olds! <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3452 mb-24" title="IMG_7935" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7935-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Upstairs, a bathroom plan is tacked up in the first apartment. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3451 mb-24" title="IMG_7912" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7912-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Six North-facing windows inside the second apartment wash the space with a lovely, even light. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3453 mb-24" title="IMG_7984" src="http:/sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="420" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984.jpg 560w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_7984-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a>Shiny new windows are already in. Can&#8217;t wait to see what else is in store for this former paper doily factory (circa 1902)!</p>
<p>Second on the list is another retrofit with Peter Maslow of <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maslow Interiors</a>. Peter has just gutted this 1000 sqft  home in the West Village and is getting started building the new plan. The former 2 bed, 1 bath will be transformed into an oversized 1 bedroom with both a full and a half-bath.  Peter is also relocating the entire kitchen, which, after the renovation is completed, will open onto a living room / library. And like the last project we saw from Peter, this one will also include  some unique finishes.</p>
