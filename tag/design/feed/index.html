			<h2>The shower bench: A bathroom detail to add for relaxation and functionality</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="two-tone-bathroom-with-glass-shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52329" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The bathroom remodel holds second place as the most popular project in the home. (The kitchen is the most popular.) While choices for tile, layout, and storage are usually top-of-mind, adding details like a shower bench can also make a big impact.</p>
<p>For many, shower benches are a nice add-on as they provide both form and function. They can help people with mobility challenges. Provide a special place for relaxation. Add a unique design perspective to the room. Or, all of the above. Here, five shower bench designs from Sweeten renovations show the comfort of taking a seat.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten </a>matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Eye-catching wraparound shower bench seating</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg" alt="bathroom wet room" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24574" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Leslie_Bathroom-07-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>One way to make a statement is with a long shower bench that wraps around the area. It gives the space an almost spa-like feel. This Sweeten homeowner took it even a step further. She elevated the design by adding in under-mounted lights. This larger-sized bench allows for extra storage as well. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/ultimate-spa-bathroom-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a> keeps a handy shower caddy at the ready. But others have been known to use it as a way to add interesting accents, like candles or even plants.</p>
<h3>A pulldown shower bench with a purpose</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="foldable-wooden-seat-bathroom"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11.jpg" alt="foldable wooden seat in bathroom with white wall tiles and grab bars along with glass shower door with long handle after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49463" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Debbie-Bathroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sometimes you just don’t have enough room to add a built-in shower bench. Don&#8217;t worry: you still have options! Smaller spaces can accommodate drop-down shower bench seats. These are great additions if you have mobility challenges (for example, for recent injuries or are elderly). They provide a safe spot to steady yourself or take a rest. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/remodeled-bathroom-for-elderly-father-is-safe-stylish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten renovation</a> combined two crowded bathrooms to create a larger, more accessible one for a father&#8217;s limited mobility. Now, his wheelchair and walker can fit and move with ease. The shower needed to be safe and comfortable with a shower bench and grab bar. Mission accomplished!</p>
<h3>A luxuriously long bench</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="shower-with-bench-and-recessed-shelves" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02.jpg" alt="walk-in shower with bench and marble tiles on walls and recessed shelves and glass door after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47475" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Krystin-Bathroom-After-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>If you do have the space, consider putting in a long shower bench—one that runs the length of your shower. This is a luxurious addition to any bathroom design. It will provide you with space for a basket of shower accessories. Or, just use it as a place to sit and relax as you enjoy the steam of a hot shower. Like the wraparound bench, it provides a visually appealing design element to the space. This <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/two-bathroom-renovation-for-resale-in-chicago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a> updated her bathrooms with resale in mind and felt that this added feature would be a draw.</p>
<h3>A versatile freestanding shower bench</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="frameless-glass-sliding-doors-walk-in-shower" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg" alt="frameless glass sliding doors to a walk in shower with steel bathroom fittings and open shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31704" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-OliviaBeaton-KitchenBath05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten homeowners, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-co-op-reno-designed-to-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olivia and Greg</a>, it was the upcoming birth of their first child that sparked a remodel. They wanted an overall update to their prewar co-op and to be more versatile. Olivia pictured a bathroom that would be a place she could retreat to. “We wanted something that looked good, but was also functional so that I could shave my legs and relax during a hot shower,” Olivia said.</p>
<h3>A functional floating bench</h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg" alt="two-tone-bathroom-with-glass-shower" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52329" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2185-Megha-KitchenBath-04-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The aesthetic of a floating shower bench is streamlined but functions like all other shower benches. When installed properly (it is important to hire an expert contractor for the project!) a floating shower bench can hold up to 400lbs. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/before-after-meghas-midtown-kitchen-and-bath-renovation-sweetened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner Megha</a> added this feature to her bath without using up a lot of space. Since it is open underneath, she could store toiletries and other necessities.</p>

			<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">From kitchens and home offices to outdoor spaces</span><span class="s2">, the top Miami home remodeling trends point to function, customization, and color</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg" alt="A balcony in Miami with a water view" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52441" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_design_trends_Ken_Hayden-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Miami, homeowners are increasingly drawing their design inspiration from color and nature. At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve observed how these themes inform the most popular Miami home remodeling trends. It&#8217;s clear that h</span><span class="s1">omeowners are rethinking both aesthetics and function, indoors and out. In this guide, Sweeten shares popular home remodeling design trends in The Magic City.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and up to $50,000 in Renovation Financial Protection—for free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Home remodeling projects in Miami are robust. “They’re putting money into their homes,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6382#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based Sweeten contractor Adrian</a>. “They see it as an investment.” </span><span class="s1">Adrian said that much of his remodeling work has less to do with adding square footage. It’s more about reconfiguring—taking away and adding walls, refreshing appliances, and fixtures.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen trends for functional and style</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consistently close to the top of the remodeling project list in Miami is the </span><span class="s2">kitchen</span><span class="s1">. “It’s the heart of the home,” said <a href="https://samrobin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-based interior designer Sam Robin</a>. “My philosophy about it hasn’t changed much. If I entertain 100 people in my home, they’ll all end up in the kitchen.” With the kitchen serving as both a functional <em>and</em> fashionable space, Miami homeowners are upgrading the room to work hard and look appealing. Below, Sweeten lists the go-to updates Miami homeowners are requesting for their kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg" alt="gray-bathroom-with-gold-hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52385" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/96911-Andrew-Kitchen-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/93911#after" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #76808f;">Sweeten kitchen remodel</a> in Miami. Photo by Real Estate Captured.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Upgrading kitchen appliances</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So many renovation plans include updating and re-prioritizing the styles and functions of appliances. The nationwide trend is toward cooking with wellness in mind, so steam ovens are becoming more prevalent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Induction cooktops are catching on (“absolutely, very trendy,” said Adrian. Sam said she still prefers gas ranges.)</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Flexible room design</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchens opening to a great room are still popular, with cabinets that look more furniture-like. But there’s definitely a move to closing off larger spaces when desired. Sliding, French, and barn-style doors do the trick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kitchen islands are being more defined by function, so Sam has specified double islands for some clients. Multi-level counters also are trending. The varying heights allow for different functions.</span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">An organic look: Natural materials </span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the overall look in the kitchen, designer Sam said there’s a trend to more organic, more natural materials. It’s all about changes in textures. Graphic backsplashes include porcelain, terra cotta, or concrete tiles. These can be earthy or bold color combinations or monochromatic tone-on-tone patterns like herringbone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a big trend toward more rustic simplicity, like <i>wabi sabi</i>,” she said, such as cement walls or concrete flooring and countertops. It’s a real organic living space.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here are some other top Miami home remodeling trends in the kitchen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Simple, flat-panel cabinetry. Lacquer finishes mostly have given way to matte.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Farm-style and trough sinks are on the rise.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide-planked floors (seven inches wide is average), such as light rift-cut oak or dark wenge.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Statement lighting. Shapes include large scale globes, square-shaped, or linear fixtures, especially over countertops</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Metal hardware. Burnished brass still is trending as well as black matte. Sometimes they’re seen in the same room.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg" alt="Marble bathroom with white double floating vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52388" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Bath trends for utility and statement materials</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractor Adrian has seen freestanding sculptural soaking tubs remain strong in Miami. However, many homeowners are preferring freestanding showers. Features like aromatherapy and steam showers are gaining traction. That’s especially true in luxury condos. <em>(For more info, see <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/miami-condo-renovations-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s Guide to Remodeling a condo in Miami.</a>)</em></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In larger homes in Miami Beach, bigger master baths are open to the master bedrooms. Adrian has installed barnyard-style doors, 6-feet wide (and wider, when more privacy is preferred.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The top Miami home remodeling trends in the bathroom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Floating vanities with integrated stone tops and storage drawers.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Stone and porcelain featuring dramatic veining that can be book-matched on statement walls.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Touchless toilets and motion-activated faucets are desirable wellness/hygiene features.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Multiple sources of lighting &#8211; Sam said while it’s important to include downlights, lighting around vanities (usually sconces) is important so that shadows aren’t created.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper, especially with tropical themes, palm trees, or foliage, is very popular in powder rooms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Outdoor space as an extension of the home</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bringing indoor style and all of their comforts outdoors is a goal. No matter what the style, the connection from indoors to out cannot be denied. “We have such an inside-outside vernacular,” said interior designer Sam. “We want to merge it because of a gorgeous landscape. It’s like having a painting in every room.”</span><span class="s3"> Outdoor kitchens feature commercial-style grills, refrigerators, and wine coolers. Fireplaces or fire pits and water features add to the ambiance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg" alt="A stone walkway with palm trees in Miami" width="1000" height="1363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52390" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-220x300.jpg 220w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Miami_renovation_design_trends_1-1-600x818.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Coral was repurposed for a walkway and retaining wall by designer Sam Robin. Photo by Ken Hayden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been doing large terraces,” said Sam. “And getting into more hardscaping, like paving materials. There’s a lot of wood, like ipe, a tropical hardwood that withstands the elements. Other materials for the outdoor space include travertine with grass in between, microcement, Keystone coral, and big boulders to create ponds. We’re creating spectacular views, framed by foliage.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indoor rooms opening up to terraces with a series of French doors or doors that fold back is another way to connect with the outside.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Home offices get a makeover</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam also has gotten a lot of requests for home offices—homeowners are trading kitchen counters for more professional dedicated spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Clients want a good back wall, appropriate for video meetings,” said Sam. “Something more professional looking, with style. They also want space for the kids to focus with computers and homework. Not just a playroom for a bunch of Legos.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam said that allocating space for a home office often involves a reset of function. For example, sitting rooms off of bedrooms or smaller family rooms are converted. Guest rooms also do double duty, with sleepers and desks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“And there’s creative storage,” said Sam. “Closets can be transformed into storage file systems with nice millwork, which can be opened up (when needed) instead of having a separate room. It depends on personal preference.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some even opt for more than one home office; the addition appears to be boosting resale value, even with a modest investment.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Miami home remodeling trends: Design details in the home</span></h3>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Impressing guests <em>and</em> personally savoring spaces</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Homeowners are investing money in renovation details that are big and small—all of which make an impact on daily living. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rolling bar carts make way for built-in cabinetry which holds wet bars, undercounter refrigeration, freezer, and wine coolers. “My clients all want wine rooms,” said Sam.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other rising design trends in Miami home remodeling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Wide plank flooring, with an average of seven inches wide, in lighter woods like ash and oak. “It’s a European country vibe,” said Adrian.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Architectural light fixtures in simple modern shapes, linear forms, and organic shapes that feature leaves and tendrils are catching on</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">LEDS are replacing halogens. There’s more accent lighting, like under-cabinet and lighting coves.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Graphic tiles (including for the floor), as well as concrete patterned tiles, are quite popular. Black and white geometrics and heritage Cuban designs are inspirations.</span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">Color palettes include earthy tones (creams and tans), blue and white (cobalt to watery blue-green), and vivid bold colors          </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Important structural elements for Miami homes</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another important consideration when remodeling in Miami is the threat of hurricanes. </span><span class="s2">Building codes</span><span class="s1"> are strict because of that. Concrete pillars, rebar and steel-reinforced walls, roof trusses and bracing roofs, and hurricane-resistant windows all are part of the conversation. <em>(</em></span><em><a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/renovating-in-the-south/how-to-prepare-your-house-for-hurricanes-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten&#8217;s guide to Preparing Homes for Hurricanes</a>.)</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are no water restrictions, however, as there are in California. But because of Miami&#8217;s wet climate, materials need to be mold and mildew-proof.</span></p>
<h4>Finding the right general contractor for a Miami home remodel</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miamians are personalizing more while remodeling their homes. In their budgets and work scopes, homeowners ensure there’s more room for a little drama.

			<h2>Six open concept kitchen ideas by Sweeten imbue space, flow, and natural light</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49429 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p>When asked what they want in a kitchen remodel, many homeowners echo the same idea: an open-concept kitchen. Gone are the days of the kitchen being cordoned off. No more swinging doors or small entryways. Renovators want big, open spaces that connect the kitchen to the dining area and sometimes to the living room, too. It is a modern concept that is both inviting and multifunctional. It also can give a smaller space the appearance of more square footage.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, a look at six o</span>pen concept kitchen ideas from <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten renovations that make kitchens the star of the remodel. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A soaring ceiling for the win</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="marble-countertop-kitchen-island"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg" alt="marble countertop on kitchen island with white cabinets and brown vinyl flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="1250" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41789" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-240x300.jpg 240w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-06-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann looked for a contractor for two years to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update her dark and dated kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in East Hampton. She wanted a space that was welcoming and large enough to accommodate her family and guests. A place that felt open and airy and just enjoyable to be in. She finally pulled the trigger on the renovation after finding a contractor through Sweeten. They teamed up to create the bright, airy kitchen of Ann’s dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann knew she wanted the faux-brick backsplash and dark cabinetry replaced with lighter, more modern options. To go along with that contemporary update, Ann also decided to remove the wall between the dining area and cook space. But the ultimate game-changer was the detail her contractor recommended: a cathedral ceiling. Bumping up the ceiling added a feeling of spaciousness far above and beyond just taking down a wall. It gives the space a grand appearance and regal style. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just love having the open space, where everyone can sit and hang out together,” Ann said.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A galley kitchen opens up</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin lived in their Bronx home</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a year-and-a-half before they decided to renovate. It was time. They were tired of the small, inefficient 124-square-foot </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/how-to-make-a-galley-kitchen-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">galley kitchen.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They wanted more natural light. To make this happen, their Sweeten contractor took down the wall between the kitchen and entryway. He also removed a partial wall between the kitchen and dining, effectively connecting the two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="kitchen cabinet styles" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41638" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-03-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the kitchen was still on the smaller side, they had to get creative with storage. They included a peninsula breakfast bar that seats four to six and features additional storage. Glass-front cabinets, a microwave cabinet, and a built-in paper towel holder are all prime examples of their extra storage solutions. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to make the most of our floor space, have an open layout, and have comfortable dimensions for navigating the kitchen,” said Elizabeth. Mission accomplished.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Flooring that ties it all together</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg" alt="washer dryer" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49429" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-05-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many, living through the pandemic made</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/1950s-home-remodel-in-los-angeles-is-pandemic-life-perfection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amy and Kevin re-evaluate their living situation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The conclusion? It was time to make the move to get more space. So they purchased a 1950s home in Los Angeles, California. From the get-go, they knew it needed to be remodeled to fit their work-from-home lifestyle. In addition to turning two of their three bedrooms into office space, they wanted to rethink their kitchen and living room.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg" alt="custom kitchen cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49430" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/66248-Amy-Home-06-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their Sweeten contractor recommended widening the kitchen doorway and removing part of the six-foot wall to help the L-shaped kitchen flow. This opened the kitchen up to the living area. To unify the two spaces that were now one, they chose white-oak engineered hardwood in eight-inch planks. They felt this would showcase the oak’s natural grain and make the house’s interior feel more cohesive. In addition, they created a nook for the refrigerator in the peninsula area. This gave them the additional room to add a large pantry—a must-have for most renovators. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is a gorgeous home with space for both of us to do our things,” says Amy. “I’m so happy!”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A more kid-friendly remodel</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-peninsula-with-quartz-countertop"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg" alt="Kitchen peninsula with quartz countertop and pendant lighting after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51253" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Samantha-Kitchen-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha is a stay-at-home mom and Jameson is an executive at a creative agency. They loved their Clinton Hill, Brooklyn co-op but it wasn’t optimal for their family of four. The couple wanted a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/kid-friendly-apartment-renovation-with-soundproofing-and-open-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">space that was more kid-friendly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out,” said Samantha. To achieve this they decided to renovate. They opened the kitchen to the living room. This way Samantha can see the family in the living room while she’s cooking in the kitchen. Plus, they added a breakfast counter with a cut-out. It serves as the perfect setting for homework—a win-win as Samantha can be doing dishes or prepping meals while she helps the kids with their school work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also rethought their old layout. They switched the dining area, which was previously by the window, with the living room sofa to make the table easily reachable. Samantha says her new open-concept kitchen is “an absolute pleasure.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>A tight New Jersey home gains valuable kitchen space</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45614" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Dining-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this Sweeten renovator and his wife moved to Montclair, New Jersey, they knew <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the home they bought needed a lot</a> of updates. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was one of the first projects on their list. The house was almost a hundred years old and it looked its age. It was small, with “looming” cabinets all around. There were only eight feet of usable counter space. And the stove looked like it was out of a 1940s movie. Not to mention the cracked “McDonald&#8217;s” tiles (red terracotta tiles that are found in some older McDonald&#8217;s restaurants). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg" alt="New Jersey kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45621" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Kitchen-9-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the renovation was to gain square footage and a better layout. Their Sweeten contractor&#8217;s plan was to tear down two walls. One had an old butler’s pantry. By removing it, they gained 18 square feet of space. That was enough to add an island. They also turned the unused cellar entryway into a walk-in pantry. The other wall that they removed was between the kitchen and dining room. Once it was down, the kitchen really took shape—their open-concept kitchen idea transformed the first floor with improved flow and natural light.</span></p>
<h3><strong>An open concept kitchen idea joins minimalism with functionalism</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-living-ding-in-one-stock"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen living and dining in one stock space and large window and hardwood floors and oak and white kitchen cabinets after renovation " width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41453" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel loved <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Long Island City</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Queens, apartment, especially the 15-foot ceilings. They reveled in the natural light that beamed in. What they didn’t love, however, was the functionality or feel of their already-open kitchen. It didn’t match their Scandinavian style and had little to no counter space. They wanted a more open space with integrated appliances, clean lines, and minimal clutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg" alt="wooden slab front kitchen cabinet door designs" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked with a Sweeten contractor and used the IKEA kitchen design tool to develop a new layout. The result is a gorgeous space with a walnut matte finish. The kitchen is seamlessly integrated into the living and dining area, with no walls to be seen anywhere. This open kitchen concept idea lets the family cook, dine, and hang out with ease all together. “It feels modern, calm, and welcoming,” said the couple. “It fits our needs and it feels like home.”</span></p>

			<h2>7 renewed living room spaces offer ideas for relaxing and gathering</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brick-highlight-wall-and-furniture"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11.jpg" alt="Brick hightlight wall in a living room complete with furniture after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51539" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-11-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Rivaled only by the kitchen and bedroom, the living room is where you spend most of your time. So, designing it to match your lifestyle and personal aesthetic is key. Here, see how seven homeowners with unique modern living room ideas reimagined their spaces. From large open-concept layouts to smaller spots with creative uses of space, aspiring renovators can find inspiration at every turn.</p>

<h3><strong>Cottage-style living room inspires a calm aesthetic</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-blue-couch"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg" alt="white living room with blue and red couch and white floor rug on wooden floor and large window after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-50372 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/28922-Monique-Apt-09-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Part of a <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/charm-queens-row-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-home remodel, this living room</a> turned from dated to dreamy. Homeowner Monique always loved the idea of a cottage-style home. So, when she bought her 1940s row house in Queens, she hired a Sweeten contractor to help realize her vision. They ripped up the carpet floors to expose beautiful hardwood and chose a classic walnut stain. To make the room appear larger, her contractor suggested opening up the archway between the entry and living room. Plus, they installed European tilt-and-turn style windows.</p>
<p>The result is a living room that has Monique’s desired aesthetic (cottage meets modern) and is bigger and brighter. “My renovated space feels like a peaceful retreat,” says Monique. “I love how welcoming and warm it feels for my friends and their kids to come and hang out.”</p>
<h3><strong>Art deco arches uplift this living room</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="living-room-arched-entryway"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05.jpg" alt="living room with arched entryway and hanging pendant lights after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-49486 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-05-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>What stands out the most in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this living room remodel is immediately clear:</a> the stunning art deco archways. When their clients hired Can Vu Bui and Lane Rick, <span>principal architects at the <a href="https://oo-t.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of Things</a>, they asked them to reimagine the main floor of their 1920s rowhouse. And that they did! From front-to-back, they incorporated Art Deco details, like the arches you see in the living room. This helped to bring in space and light, which was the main goal. “We replaced the existing walls with elegant structural arches,” says Bui. The space went from dreary to cheery. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Elegant seating with a view</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg" alt="Glam style living room with floor-to-ceiling curtains and natural light" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-37459 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-01a-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/kips-bay-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room in this Kips Bay, Manhattan apartment</a> had good bones. It was already, spacious so no walls needed to be knocked down to increase its square footage. It featured a stunning wall of windows and original hardwood floors. The challenge for interior designer Tara Benet was to refresh this tired living room, last renovated 30 years ago.</p>
<p>To help her do so, she hired a Sweeten contractor. Together, they transformed a dull space into a work of art. They started by removing the old track lighting (nothing dates a place more than bad lighting!) The ceiling was concrete so they couldn’t install recessed lighting. The workaround? Two gorgeous chandeliers that do double duty. They effectively light the room and provide a beautiful focal point.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1.jpg" alt="Closeup of modern living room coffee table with flower vase and modern white sofa" width="1000" height="1250" class="alignnone wp-image-35657 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-600x750.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-723x904.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Tara-Benet-MurrayHill-Apt-07-1-585x731.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/flooring-options-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flooring also needed to be redone</a>. The original area rug was in the same spot for nearly 30 years. The intense UV rays faded the varnish over the years, leaving the flooring two-toned. The fix was to re-sand and re-varnish the entire floor in a light stain to add a fresh look. Benet also selected a white, with a slight orange base, for the walls. The result: a mix of muted and rich hues of blue and gold for a modern aesthetic that pops.</p>
<h3><strong>A small but spunky studio apartment</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg" alt="Modern living room in studio apartment with bold red sofa and black accents" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-46927 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Taylor-Studio-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The apartment itself may be small, but the living room’s design is big in style. Taylor turned to Sweeten to find a contractor to help renovate <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovating-a-hand-me-down-co-op-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her family’s 320-square-foot Manhattan studio.</a> She knew it wasn’t going to be her forever home, so she renovated with that in mind. She was delighted when her contractor found curved pass-throughs underneath drywall and paneling. “It was great to find a bit of the apartment’s charm still intact,” said Taylor. She also ripped out the paneling and updated the dark teal walls.</p>
<p>Before the remodel, she said it felt a little like a “dungeon.” But by opting for a lighter color for the walls, it instantly brightened up the space. She gave it a modern feel by painting the window trim in a contemporary charcoal shade.</p>
<h3><strong>A Hollywood star gets a new living room for a growing family</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17.jpg" alt="Image of a modern living room renovation for Jaime Ray Newman" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-46474 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-17-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Like so many other homeowners,<em> Little Fires Everywhere</em> actress Jaime Ray Newman and her husband <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/a-ranch-style-home-and-garage-renovation-for-actress-producer-jaime-ray-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dreamed of renovating their home</a>. But when the couple discovered they were expecting their second, they realized it was time. “It was now or never,” says Newman. “We knew that with two kids, we’d want an open floor plan.” So, they hired a designer and a Sweeten contractor and got to work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06.jpg" alt="ranch home renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46463" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sweeten-Jaime-LA_ADU-06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The result is a living room that is both stylish and functional for her young family. The room seamlessly flows into the kitchen and dining area for much-needed clear sightlines. A gray sectional ties into the gray and white cabinets of the kitchen while a console with wood doors complements the nearby dining table. The actor and producer have this advice for those thinking of renovating. “These are massive decisions that you can’t turn back on, so hire a designer if you have doubts,” she says. “And hire a contractor whose aesthetic you love.”</p>
<h3>Reproducing the look and feel of a modern hotel</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03.jpg" alt="A modern Williamsburg loft living room with blue velvet couch" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-45649 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Wife and husband duo, Keren and Thomas Richter, run White Arrow, a design firm in NYC. Their client, a successful digital agency founder, wanted his <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-williamsburg-studio-goes-boutique-hotel-chic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn apartment to have the essence</a> of a sophisticated, urban hotel. He was used to traveling for work and this aesthetic spoke to him. One of the challenges was the narrow layout of the ground floor. A positive was the high ceilings, but the small, tight space also had what Richter explains as “a disjointed arrangement of extrusions and unflattering angles.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01.jpg" alt="Living room with double height loft ceilings and gold lighting fixture" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone wp-image-45647 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keren-WhiteArrow-Loft-01-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>They worked with a Sweeten contractor to fix this. Design techniques were employed to make the space feel wider and more expansive. For example, they bleached the floors to make them lighter. They also white-washed the exposed brick for a more modern feel. And finally, added dramatic chandeliers and sconces to draw the eye up. “The designs are super smart and well-executed,” the homeowner says. “I am really happy.”</p>
<h3>A multi-functional family room</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-living-room-with-couch"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10.jpg" alt="White living room with couch and armchairs with brick wallpapers after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51540" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Apartment-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan decided to live</a> in their outdated loft in Soho for a few years before making the decision to renovate. When the couple found out they were going to have a baby, they sprung into action. They needed a space that was conducive to their new family life. Tara and Ryan hired a Sweeten contractor to re-imagine their 1,200-square-foot apartment.</p>
<p>In addition to a kitchen and bathroom remodel, the couple wanted a functional family/living room. &#8220;The vision was to embrace the original loft aesthetic with an industrial-meets-modern design,&#8221; said Tara. &#8220;We wanted to re-expose the brick along the entire length of the living room wall.&#8221; This gave it the updated industrial look they desired. This long wall also allowed them to add much-needed storage. They had built-ins installed, which are perfect for storing toys, books, and other household items. It is now an ideal family room—both beautiful and functional.</p>

			<h2>An all-white kitchen can become a calming backdrop, or a stunning showstopper</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20220" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The dependable all-white kitchen color palette remains popular for the wide-ranging looks it brings to the kitchen. The clean slate of a single white hue brings visual calm when on its own. Add to that tile shape, pattern, and texture and you&#8217;ll start to see a personality emerge. It works as a supportive background when paired with gold hardware or dark wood for contrast. This classic neutral compliments modern, industrial, and every style in-between. Here, seven Sweeten kitchens show why white is the perennial choice.</p>

<h3><strong>A fresh start in an all-white kitchen</strong></h3>

<p>As new parents-to-be, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Tara and Brian were looking</a> for something more modern. They wanted to ditch their dated kitchen with a faulty layout. After finalizing the floor plan, the homeowners chose a simple white subway tile backsplash to ground the room. The clean tile became a cohesive backdrop for an exotic live edge walnut island countertop<span>—</span>a must-have for Tara. The dark shelves stand out and provide a pleasant contrast.</p>
<h3>A traditional kitchen goes modern</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="Sweeten kitchen with Semihandmade cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34317" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Marc-Metter-Kitchen-07-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seven months of living in their first home,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-white-kitchen-sized-just-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc and Steve decided it was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time to renovate their crowded, outdated kitchen, which was once dark and claustrophobic. The homeowners wanted their kitchen to feel open and bright. To achieve this, the duo installed sleek white cabinets and countertops. The window above the sink was swapped out for a larger window letting in more natural light. A black-and-white patterned floor added a graphic urban look.</span></p>
<h3>A warm, minimalist all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38850" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-Elie-Chau-Kitchen-01-1-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan homeowners</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/a-galley-kitchen-gets-in-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elie and Matt wanted to remodel</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">their washed-out gallery kitchen. Custom-made<span style="color: #333333;"> white cabinets,</span> along with a white quartz countertop and backsplash moved them in a direction that was more in line with their taste. The pop of gold hardware and large-format gray tile flooring made the kitchen feel luxurious, yet crisp and simple. Their new all-white kitchen makes Elie and Matt feel at home in the open, welcoming space.</span></p>
<h3>A simple and current all-white kitchen</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="brick wall" width="800" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-49320" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SarahD-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a kitchen that had gone through &#8220;a hodgepodge&#8221; of renovations,</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/washington-heights-kitchen-renovation-for-a-family/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah and Eddy decided they needed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a complete change and a unifying design. Their kitchen was dark and dated. The goal was to achieve the opposite. The subway tile backsplash, grouted with dark gray, contrasted well with the open wood shelves. Keeping within the clean white look, an arabesque-patterned tile behind the stove was a nice design surprise. A neutral-toned banquette also stands out against a newly-discovered brick wall.</span></p>
<h3>Let there be light</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" class="alignnone wp-image-20220" style="font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif;" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SWEETEN_Mila_Kitchen-03-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Two <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/white-walls-and-black-hardware-in-a-windowed-pre-war-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newlyweds in Manhattan</a> knew their kitchen was in need of an update before moving in. The kitchen had been worn, with dark clunky cabinets, while the dining room table made the kitchen feel cramped. After adding white cabinets with black knobs and a white quartz countertop, the space was revived. Extending the countertop underneath a window expanded the kitchen&#8217;s reach. The natural light shines through the new counter-to-ceiling windows, making the all-white kitchen gleam.</p>
<h3>Using architecture to add texture</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29280" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN_Tara_and_Ryan_Houser_Apartment-03-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-loft-in-a-former-silk-warehouse-gets-a-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Ryan found their kitchen</a> to be functional, yet dark and musty. There was definitely room for improvement! Working around a column in the middle of the room, the couple was able to find a layout they liked. They achieved this by moving the kitchen island<span style="color: #333333;"> </span>slightly to create more room. The show-stopping feature of the room is its now dazzling white appearance. A once dated and crowded kitchen was now open and bright.</p>
<h3>All-white, with floor-to-ceiling storage</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44167" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nadia and Stephen planned to be</span></a> avid home chefs in their multigenerational townhome. But with their L-shaped kitchen, counter-space and storage were lacking, they needed some updates. The kitchen was moved to one side which made space to include an island, wraparound pantry, and dining room table. The all-white cabinets with no hardware added to the modern and streamlined look of the new bright and spacious family kitchen.<del></del></p>

			<h2><strong>These classic Colonial kitchen renovations show interiors ready for modern-day life</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg" alt="yonkers colonial house" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45098" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Exterior-22-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) The 1919 Colonial of Sweeten homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda and Cory</a></span></span></p>
<p>The quaintness of Colonial-style homes is undeniable. Usually marked by two or three stories and brick or wood facades, these dwellings are traditionally found on the east coast. They are typically characterized by a simple almost minimalist shape. The floor plan keeps the kitchen and dining room on the first floor with bedrooms on the second. And while some have open-concept layouts, it is more common to see separation between rooms. They are also easy to remodel by adding on to the side or back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we look at three Colonial kitchen renovations by Sweeten—examples of their older interiors redone to bring in modern style and conveniences.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bringing a Tudor Colonial into the next century</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg" alt="blue gray kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34775" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Built in 1912, </span>Nilda and Brian’s<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tudor Colonial in Westchester County, NY, desperately needed a remodel. The 4,400-square-foot home featured a kitchen that was last updated almost 60 years ago. It was time for a change. “The floor was three inches off-level,” says Nilda. “You could peek through the floor to the basement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg" alt="backyard entry" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34776" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Nilda-Del-Valle-Heller-Kitchen-03-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />The couple hired a Sweeten contractor for the remodel. To honor the historic style, they maintained some separation between the kitchen and the other living spaces. New cabinets, flooring, and lighting updated the look. They also opened up the back wall to install a patio door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They kept a traditional feel by opting for Shaker cabinets in a modern gray color. The butler’s pantry also keeps the turn-of-the-century vibe but with a contemporary twist.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Colonial Revival home gets rejuvenated</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44333" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN-Nydia-After-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Fiske Terrace, Brooklyn, is a quiet enclave built at the turn of the 20th century. Interestingly, the Flatbush neighborhood is filled with Colonial Revival homes. So when </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/modern-colonial-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nydia and Jonathan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought their 3,240-square-foot home in 2012, they decided to renovate. But at the time, they put off the larger renovation of the outdated kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="Brooklyn kitchen, renovation, remodel" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37425" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/SWEETEN-Nydia-Ramos-Kitchen-05-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Eventually, they turned to Sweeten to find the right contractor for their old-home renovation. They wanted to take advantage of the natural light the house afforded. However, like in many other Colonial home renovations, the small windows blocked out the light. As a solution, they replaced them with white-framed ones. In addition, they updated the kitchen with gray-blue cabinets and brushed gold accents. These design choices make the aesthetic modern yet still warm and inviting. The bonus? The exposed brick from the chimney area brings even more character.</span></p>
<h3><strong>From challenged to Colonial charming </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg" alt="drip dishware collection" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45107" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dated salmon-colored Formica didn’t stop </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-1919-colonial-house-finds-renewal-in-soft-tones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda and Cory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from buying their 1919 Colonial home. For a while, they actually found it charming. However, they knew eventually it needed to be renovated. They hired a Sweeten contractor to update the kitchen to accommodate their family’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On their list of goals was creating a better flow of traffic and light. A challenge of renovating Colonial homes is their notorious separation of rooms. The main entrance to the kitchen by way of the dining room was too narrow. As a result, it isolated the kitchen. But taking down the wall felt disrespectful to the house’s character, so instead, they simply widened and centered it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg" alt="old house kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45101" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Amanda-Kitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a lot of Colonials, there was some asymmetry in the house. One example was the sheetrock box-beam in the kitchen. They assumed it encased something hard to move, so they left it. However, they fixed the problem by giving it a matching beam which created symmetry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new space makes us feel happy,” says Amanda. “It feels so harmonious with the rest of our beautiful old Colonial home.”</span></p>

			<h2>From granite to quartz, different types of kitchen countertops can deliver on both looks and performance</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SWEETEN_Meredith_Kitchen-Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-0 size-full" title="Caesarstone countertop in Statuario Maximus" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>Updated on October 14, 2021</em></span></span></p>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen cabinets</a>, kitchen countertops have the most style impact in the kitchen. There are many types of kitchen countertops to choose from—stone, quartz, solid surfacing, wood, to identify the most popular—so you’ll want to take a few factors into consideration before pulling out your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where will it go? Will it be attractive if it’s visible from adjoining living areas as well as the cooking space?</li>
<li>How will you use it and how often? Can it stand up to common spills and daily impact with cooking tools?</li>
<li>What other features will it connect to? Will it look good and stand up to adjoining elements, like a sink or a stovetop?</li>
<li>How often do you clean? Besides the after-meal swipe with a sponge, are you up for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-ways-care-renovated-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking the time for regular maintenance</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, whatever your answers are to the questions above, there is a countertop for you. Today’s eclectic kitchen styles also welcome a mix of materials, so don’t worry about everything matching. You can have one material for the island and another for the countertop, or treat yourself to a small slab of marble for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar space</a>, for instance. For best results, always hire a professional certified to fabricate and install the particular material you choose.</p>
<p>Below are popular kitchen countertops that Sweeten homeowners have installed, along with the pros and cons of each material.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</span></p>
<h3>Marble kitchen countertops</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25997 mb-10 size-full" title="Carrera marble countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg" alt="Image of marble kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_Lia_Kitchen_Bathroom-12-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Carrara marble kitchen countertops in </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/exposed-beams-and-marble-finishes-frame-a-luxury-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia and Chris’ kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Sought for its classic beauty and variety, marble still draws its fans among homeowners who want to have stone in the kitchen. However, it is more porous than granite, and this factor—combined with a high price tag—limits its application to a few areas of the kitchen, like entertaining or baking areas. Remember that this particular material enjoyed pride-of-place in grand homes in the last two centuries, so if you are up for classic elegance that yields a timeworn patina, this could be the stone for you.</p>
<h4>Cost of <strong>marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at more than $100 per square foot (which does not include fabrication)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pros of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Withstands high heat</li>
<li>Adds a high-quality, luxury look suitable for traditional or contemporary kitchens</li>
<li>Stays cool, so good for rolling out dough</li>
<li>Pairs beautifully with many other surfaces, especially wood and metal</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cons of marble kitchen countertops</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The most expensive of stones</li>
<li>Limited in color choices—whites, grays, blacks</li>
<li>Stains, scratches, cracks, and chips more easily than other stones</li>
<li>Requires monthly sealing and may still discolor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Soapstone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43650 mb-10 size-full" title="Blue/green soapstone countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg" alt="Image of soapstone countertop and backsplash" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JanetJerry-kitchen-15-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Soapstone countertops in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet and Jerry&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Soapstone’s resistance to heat and water, along with a muted color palette marked by subtle veining, makes it an appealing alternative to granite and marble. It also comes with a slightly lower price tag, which is attractive to budget-conscious homeowners. However, soapstone countertops do require care, like all stones.</p>
<h4>Cost of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70-$100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists heat and water</li>
<li>Color tends to be uniform throughout the slab</li>
<li>Suitable for sinks, too, if you want a blended look</li>
<li>Comes in at the lower price spectrum of natural stone</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of soapstone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches easily and will show stains, which can be sanded out</li>
<li>May crack or chip if you aren’t careful when working on it</li>
<li>Requires regular sealing and will show stains if not wiped up immediately</li>
<li>Develops a patina over time, which you may or may not like</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engineered stone countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45708 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg" alt="Image of townhouse kitchen with engineered stone counters" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bellamy-Townhouse-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Engineered quartz countertops by Caesarstone in <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-brownstone-flips-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellamy and Zak&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, engineered stone is probably the toughest surface on the market. This material is typically 90 percent quartz mixed with pigments and polyester resin, then manufactured under pressure into highly dense slabs. Manufacturers such as Caesarstone offer a vast array of looks, including many faux granites as well as the whitest whites, blackest blacks, and some brilliant colors like red and blue. Claims that it won’t stain or fade or succumb to high heat make them <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;popular kitchen countertops&quot;}">popular kitchen countertops</span>, edging out granite, despite the fact that the cost is roughly the same or higher than natural stone.</p>
<h4>Cost of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $100 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most impervious of all surfaces; resists heat, stains, scratches, bacteria, fading</li>
<li>Huge selection of patterns and colors, including faux stones and custom colors</li>
<li>Can be manufactured into nearly any shape you want</li>
<li>Requires no sealing or special maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of engineered stone countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Faux stone doesn’t appear to look like real stone</li>
<li>May crack on sudden impact with a heavy object</li>
<li>Costs as much as real stone</li>
<li>Solid-colored slabs will show seams</li>
</ul>
<h3>Granite countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-41793 mb-10 size-full" title="honed black granite countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg" alt="Image of granite countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Ann-Strahle-Kitchen-10-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above) Granite countertops in </em><a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/kitchen-renovations/kitchen-renovation-east-hampton-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ann&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Granite landed on the kitchen scene a little over two decades ago and remains popular. It’s a close second behind the number one choice, engineered stone, according to a survey from the National Kitchen and Bath Association. Why do granite countertops endure? Simply put, they combine unique beauty with durability and low maintenance. The natural grain means no two slabs will be identical. While very hard and impervious to heat, granite is porous, so it needs to be sealed at least annually—easy enough with hand application by sponge.</p>
<h4>Cost of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts around $60-$100 per foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resists high heat</li>
<li>Comes in a range of colors and grains</li>
<li>Each slab has a unique appearance</li>
<li>Maintains its value if well cared for, including sealing annually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of granite countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Expensive, but popular colors come in lower prices</li>
<li>Shows wear from knives and spills like vinegar, citrus juice, and oils, so use a cutting board on top</li>
<li>Requires regular maintenance, which a DIY project with a sealant and a sponge can accomplish</li>
<li>Will crack if improperly installed or a heavy object makes an impact</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid surface countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-49495 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg" alt="Image of a kitchen with black and white floor" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Matthew-Townhouse-After-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/an-architect-guided-art-deco-renovation-for-a-queens-townhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architects Can Vu Bui, Lane Rick, and Matthew Storrie&#8217;s kitchen remodel </a></span></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, solid surfacing was the darling in the world of kitchen countertops. It still deserves consideration, as many qualities have been improved over time by brands like <a href="https://www.corian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corian</a>. It is heat- and stain-resistant and comes in a range of looks, including faux stone, and lots of fashion colors. Because it has a little give, due to it being made of acrylic or polyester or a blend of the two, objects dropped on solid surface counters are less likely to break. It also can be molded into many shapes, including intricate inlays, edge and backsplash treatments, as well as furniture.</p>
<h4>Cost of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>$80 to $100 per square foot, depending on the pattern and color</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Heat- moisture-, and fade-resistant</li>
<li>Enormous choice of colors and patterns, including custom</li>
<li>Seams fuse together so joints don’t show</li>
<li>Molds into just about any shape including integrated backsplash or sink</li>
<li>Does not require sealing; clean with mild detergent</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of solid surface countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can’t take high heat; will lose shape</li>
<li>Vulnerable to scratches, cuts, and prolonged exposure to stains like wine or catsup; requires a cutting board</li>
<li>Faux stone looks don’t exactly resemble stone</li>
<li>Not recyclable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wood countertops</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44120 mb-10 size-full" title="walnut wood countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg" alt="Image of kitchen with wooden butcher block countertop" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/slider58/Lavanya-kitchen-13-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Wood countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/renovate-railroad-apartment-home-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lavanya and Regis&#8217; kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Probably America’s earliest type of kitchen countertop, wood is still desired for its natural beauty and warmth. Wood countertops can take moderate heat, but it will show burns, dings, and knife cuts. Fans consider the patina part of the appeal. Most damage can be sanded out; be sure to reapply food-safe mineral oil after any repair. Avoid installation in areas like the sink with prolonged exposure to moisture, which will cause it to swell. Clean with a damp sponge and a mild detergent. Hardwoods such as maple and oak are most commonly used as kitchen countertops, in a butcher-block pattern, which provides additional strength. Another pro of wood countertops: they&#8217;re a thriftier choice than many of the other types of countertops described above.</p>
<h4>Cost of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $35 per square foot; rarer woods can be more expensive</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to clean and repair</li>
<li>Good for cutting and chopping; knives won’t dull with contact</li>
<li>Won’t chip and objects dropped on it are less likely to break</li>
<li>Provides a rich look for a price lower than many other kitchen surfaces</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of wood countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to moisture, chemicals, and high heat, which cause permanent damage</li>
<li>Immediately shows signs of use</li>
<li>Expands or contracts with extreme swings in a moist environment</li>
<li>Requires food-safe sealant and regular care to preserve the surface</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laminate countertops<b></b></h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26004 mb-10 size-full" title="Dekton laminate countertop" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg" alt="Image of laminate kitchen countertops" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SWEETEN_DanKitchen-13-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Laminate countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/small-kitchen-renovation-dan-mike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan and Mike’s kitchen remodel</a></span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p>While not so rugged as most types of countertops today, laminate countertops still have plenty of upsides. To start, laminate countertops come in loads of patterns and colors and have a thrifty price tag. Made of resin-covered paper backed by plywood or particleboard, laminate does come with its share of synthetics. To ensure your indoor air quality, look for laminate countertops certified by Greenguard, like <a href="https://www.wilsonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wilsonart.</a> This indicates they are made from low-emitting materials that use formaldehyde-free paper and low- or non-toxic glues. This fashion-friendly surface can mimic the look of stone, wood, or fabric, or any graphic the manufacturer can think of. It will last for a few decades with proper care, which includes no direct cutting on the surface or exposure to acid or chemicals.</p>
<h4>Cost of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at $10 to $20 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires minimal care and no sealing</li>
<li>Available in a vast selection of patterns and colors</li>
<li>Easy to cut and install in tight spaces</li>
<li>Well-priced, particularly for a product with so many style options</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of laminate countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and burns easily; sometimes impossible to repair</li>
<li>Seams show, particularly on solid colors</li>
<li>Allows only drop-in sinks, due to their construction</li>
<li>Anything other than the simplest edge treatment will drive up the price</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stainless steel countertops</h3>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44554 mb-10 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg" alt="Image of stainless steel countertops in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Beth-Kitchen-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></strong><span class="img-label"><span style="color: #76808f;">(<em>Above</em>) Stainless steel countertops in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-check-all-the-boxes-apartment-for-empty-nesters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth and Bob&#8217;s kitchen remodel</a></span></p>
<p>Of all the types of kitchen countertops, stainless steel countertops are commonly used in commercial kitchens. This is because stainless steel can take a beating: from knives, high heat, most spills, and it’s completely anti-bacterial. You must avoid caustic chemicals, but since it’s water- and stain-proof, that’s not an issue unless you use it for something other than food prep. It comes in a number of finishes, including polished and brushed, which help hide scratches. Dings and dents will show up and are impossible to remove without displacing the countertop. But if you want a pro-style countertop, those battle scars can be shown with pride.</p>
<h4>Cost of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Starts at around $70 per square foot</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Super-resilient material is water-, stain-, fade-proof and resists bacteria</li>
<li>No need for sealing; cleans with simple detergent and water</li>
<li>Integrates seamlessly with features like drainboards, sinks, and backsplashes</li>
<li>Manufactured to exact specifications, so potentially seamless</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons of stainless steel countertops</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not suitable for cutting; must use a board to protect from knives</li>
<li>Shows the smallest scratches and dents, which are very hard to remove</li>
<li>Noisy when kitchen tools come in contact</li>
<li>Fabrication will drive up the price unless you buy a ready-made sink and drainboard unit</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These kitchen pantry designs prove that out-of-the-way organization can fit in apartments <em>and</em> single-family homes</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44167 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg" alt="kitchen, kitchen island, Brooklyn kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-14-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><strong>Storage, storage, storage.</strong> They say that in real estate that location is key. When it comes to kitchens, plenty of storage is essential. Kitchen pantries are easy and popular ways to increase the square footage of storage in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry—pantries don&#8217;t have to be massive (but they can be if you have the space for it!) With careful and creative design, smaller areas can serve as a place to put food items, serving accessories, dishes, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Here, we share examples of different kitchen pantry designs from homeowners who <a href="https://sweeten.com/vetted-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with a Sweeten contractor</a> to ensure they had ample storage in their homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Repurposing an entryway</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45625" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Warren-Pantry-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For these Montclair, New Jersey homeowners, updating the kitchen of their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/pockets-of-space-reveal-an-expanded-suburban-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new home</a> was a must. It felt small and claustrophobic, and only had eight feet of usable counter space. The configuration needed a lot of improvement. They worked with a Sweeten contractor to rework the layout.</p>
<p>The first thing they did was to remove an old butler&#8217;s pantry, which <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/whats-better-kitchen-peninsulas-or-islands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freed up space to add an island</a>. However, a pantry was still on their wish list, so they got rid of an unused cellar entrance and converted it into a walk-in pantry.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Pull-out drawers</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42272" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="2000" height="3000" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SWEETEN-AndrewGottleib-Kitchen-12-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/still-a-galley-kitchen-with-a-bright-pass-through/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gina and Andrew</a> were uninspired by their dated kitchen that featured drab cabinets and an inconvenient layout. It was completely sectioned off from the living area and desperately needed a refresh. Working with their Sweeten contractor, the couple reimagined the layout to make it a functional and stylish kitchen. The cherry on top? The new floor-to-ceiling pantry with pull-out drawers. Pull-out drawers are always a plus since they help keep the space organized and provide easy-to-access item storage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Floor-to-ceiling storage in a small apartment</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47056" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg" alt="galley kitchen" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Michele-Kitchen-After-02-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For Sweeten renovator Michele, it all started with a bathroom remodel, and the desire to replace her dishwasher. That turned into a <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovating-a-bathroom-kitchen-to-make-home-a-happier-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full gut reno of her kitchen</a>—but it was a change of plans that she was very happy with. Her Sweeten contractor recommended renovating to use the unused space near the entrance more efficiently. That got the ball rolling. The result is a large pantry, which fits in between the refrigerator and dishwasher. &#8220;Having a floor-to-ceiling pantry is a fantastic luxury in a smallish apartment,&#8221; says Michele.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Wraparound pantry with copious storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44170" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nadia-Kitchen-Builtins-11a.gif" alt="pantry" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-rowhouse-becomes-a-multigenerational/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia and Stephen</a> were searching for a home that would fit their multigenerational family. They found it in their 2,300-square-foot home in Brooklyn, New York. The most striking design feature in their new home is the massive wraparound kitchen pantry. They added full-height cabinets since the area had a limit of 15-inch depths. This gave them plenty of storage space for serving ware, food items, and cleaning products.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Hidden door-style storage</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44867" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-Apt-11.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-40332 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>For their Park Slope two-bedroom co-op, Tara and Brian found a Sweeten contractor to help them <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rework their kitchen layout</a>. To lighten a hardworking wall that contained the stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinetry, their contractor suggested relocating the refrigerator to an existing cluster of storage cabinets just outside the kitchen proper. The wall instantly felt lighter. Where the fridge once stood, the contractor cleverly made a small pantry, matching the &#8220;concealed&#8221; concept. When closed, the pantry looks like a tiled wall, but opens to reveal 10-inch deep shelves.</p>
<hr />
<h3>The kitchen&#8217;s helper</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26915 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen pantry" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen pantry" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-46-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazli passed on upper cabinets so that she could mimic the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feeling of an open-plan apartment</a> on the first floor of her townhouse, establishing a clear line of vision from her front room all the way to the dining room. To make sure there was enough storage, the contractor created a walk-in pantry. Since the pantry is open to the rest of the kitchen, Nazli decided to paint it a darker color so that its contents wouldn&#8217;t be too distracting, allowing it to blend into its surroundings and almost disappear from sight.</p>

			<h2 class="p1">Your dream basement renovation is possible. Here are the technical codes to tick off with your contractor.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-48554 mb-10 size-full" title="light-brown-vinyl-floor-basement" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg" alt="Light brown vinyl floor in gray and white basement with stairs and banister after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cristiana-Basement-09-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> <span style="color: #76808f;"><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Tracy and Gordon&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-basement-remodel-boosts-a-petite-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement renovation</a> added living space to their small footprint</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many benefits to upgrading a dark, damp basement to an inviting living space. Basement renovations can add significant square footage—and resale value—to a home. And it can be a blank slate; something to reimagine for any of your family&#8217;s needs, including entertaining, working from home, or relaxing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to your wish list, you&#8217;ll need to consider several technical and building code details, such as minimum ceiling heights, emergency egress regulations, insulation, and moisture control. These will influence your basement renovation&#8217;s timeline and cost.</p>
<p>We offer an overview of what would be involved. A vetted general contractor with <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">basement remodeling experience</a> would provide a more in-depth discussion of what is possible in your space.</p>
<h3>Typical costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> general contractors have worked on basement remodels starting at $20,000. This price point would update an already finished space and include painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. For a raw space that is being renovated to a finished living area, the average cost is $75,000. With this budget, you&#8217;ll likely be able to include a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The existing condition of the space will always impact the budget. The floor may need to be dug deeper to increase ceiling height. The walls may require underpinning. New wiring and plumbing may need to be installed—guaranteed if you&#8217;re planning a whole new kitchen or bathroom. Insulation and waterproofing may be needed to control condensation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happily, according to our contractors, there are no deal-breakers when it comes to basement renovations. Any problem—bad plumbing, lack of natural light, high humidity, a low ceiling—can all be sorted to create your dream basement. Ultimately, it will all depend on how much you are willing to spend. “It’s a balancing act to how much you want to put into the house before you exceed what value it brings,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/1368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan, a Sweeten contractor</a>. &#8220;You also have to decide if cost value is important to you or is it more important to have a home you want to live in.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Square footage determines a basement renovation budget</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in the renovation cost, as well as in the value it adds to your home. Sweeten general contractor Kyle says that his smallest basement renovation added just 400 square feet of living space, to be used as a kids&#8217; play area. More typical basement renovations are around 1,000 square feet, he said. And don’t forget: If the basement houses equipment, like a furnace or boiler, a mechanical room could take away a few hundred square feet from the livable space.</p>
<h3>Ceiling height requirements for basement renovations</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although building regulations vary from town to town, our contractors say the minimum height requirement for ceilings will be between six and seven feet. You may choose to add more height than this, for comfort and aesthetics. About 50% of basement jobs require the floor to be dug lower to allow for additional ceiling height. This process involves cracking open the existing concrete floor, removing the excess dirt, and re-laying the concrete.</p>
<h3>Creating a second form of egress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you envision creating a living space for your basement, rather than a laundry and storage area? If so, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll need a second exit, also called an egress. &#8220;To be comfortable and have no problems with building inspectors, you will need that second form of egress, such as a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level,&#8221; said Kyle, a Sweeten contractor. That usually means digging down to make an open passageway on one side of the building so there is a way to get in and out.</p>
<h3>Basement renovations that add plumbing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, homeowners will add a half or a full bath to their new basement space. The plumbing for this usually goes under the concrete flooring. This will help avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Since your basement living space will probably be below sewer lines, you&#8217;ll need a pump to get waste out, said Kyle. Of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-bathroom-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a bathroom</a> will also add to the budget, but for many, the convenience is worth it, he said.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing and insulation protection</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basements account for the majority of your home&#8217;s indoor moisture, according to Alan. On top of the general humidity in your basement, flooding may be a periodic problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to moisture problems is often insulation and waterproofing. There are intelligent products that can help. If a conversion involves a bedroom, it is especially important to control moisture, to prevent toxic from forming. In-wall products like <a href="https://www.certainteed.com/building-insulation/products/membrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CertainTeed’s MemBrain</a> is an accessory to regular insulation that allows the buildup of moisture to escape while preventing moisture from entering in the first place. Its 2-step installation process will add a few extra days to a basement renovation timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even with intelligent products, insulation requires multiple products and systems to stay on top of heat, cold, and humidity, according to Ted Winslow, a representative from CertainTeed. This could mean using spray foam to fill in cracks and seal windows and doors, along with other insulation products.</p>
<h3>Improving basement ventilation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent toxic mold, the humidity of living spaces should be kept below 60 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-course-chapter-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Achieving this often requires ventilation, in addition to waterproofing and insulation. Relying on natural airflow from windows is possible, but its subject to the weather and seasons. Extending your home&#8217;s existing HVAC system will also help ventilate the basement area. However, many basements will require the direct removal of humidity. Kareem suggests installing exhaust fans into the wall or window. These push damp air out while circulating the remaining air around the entire house. This system can either turn on when the lights are switched on, or be equipped with sensors that switch the fans on once humidity gets above a certain level. A dehumidifier is another option, but be prepared to pump that wastewater up to the sewer lines.</p>

<p class="schema-faq-answer">The amount of finished space you add to your basement will be a major factor in costs. Additionally, adding a kitchen or bathroom to a basement will increase costs considerably, so keep your remodel simple–painting, flooring, a new closet, and lighting. However, don’t skimp on humidity-controlling features: basements are prone to wetness, causing toxic mold. Be sure to install a good HVAC system, exhaust fans, or a dehumidifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065183452"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make a basement into a living space</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">First, make sure the ceiling height is adequate–at least 6-7 feet. You’ll also need a second form of egress, which is an exit from the lower level to the outside. This could be a window or a door with steps leading outside to ground level. To create an egress, you’ll need to dig down to make an open passageway on one side of the building to create the way in and out. Basements are prone to humidity, which can cause mold; so install a new HVAC system and exhaust fans.</p>
</div>
<div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1640065198167"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to add a bathroom to a basement</u></strong></strong>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To add a bathroom to a basement, you’ll need new wiring and plumbing, which usually goes under the concrete flooring. Although it can be costly, a benefit to adding plumbing beneath the flooring is that you’ll avoid flooding if any of the pipes burst. Additionally, you may also need insulation and waterproofing to control condensation, which can cause mold growth in basements. Since most basements are below sewer lines, you’ll need a pump to get waste out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What can homeowners do when they need more space at home—but don&#8217;t want to leave?</h2>
<p>Many homeowners find themselves in a tough spot when their home&#8217;s space, design, or location stops working for them. Many wind up asking themselves: should I move, or remodel?  A <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/americans-prefer-renovations-21576/">Zillow study</a> found that when given a choice between spending a fixed budget on a down payment or using the same amount to remodel, 76 percent would opt to renovate.</p>
<p>Between leaving their neighborhoods and staying put, these homeowners ultimately made the choice to reimagine their homes with Sweeten&#8217;s help. <span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<h3>A big refresh for a beloved loft</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leah and Brian loved the Logan Square <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-chicago-loft-renovation-springs-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loft they had been calling home</a> for several years. The Chicago neighborhood’s energy and the industrial brick warehouse added to the lifestyle they were enjoying. But with time the wear-and-tear takes a toll on materials and daily functioning. They decided to renovate and stay in the area. The couple posted their project on Sweeten to update the entire space including a new kitchen and floors. Without structural changes, Leah and Brian brought out the best of their 14-foot ceilings.</span></p>

<h3>When you can&#8217;t go bigger, get creative</h3>
<p>Surging prices in her Fort Greene co-op building made upgrading from a studio to a true one-bedroom <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/film-editor-revitalizes-her-starter-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out of the question for Mollie</a>. She had to decide to either move elsewhere to get more space or remodel her cozy studio. Luckily, Mollie realized the market value of her apartment (and that she could borrow against her equity)! She came to Sweeten, was matched with a general contractor, and reconfigured the 500-square-foot apartment to suit her playful style.</p>

<h3>Baby on the way? Make your square footage go further</h3>
<p>A two-bedroom apartment was perfect for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Marco</a>—until they decided to expand their family. Fortunately, their duplex had enough square footage for them to get creative with! This made it possible to remodel and rethink how they used the layout, instead of moving. They turned the top floor into a combined kitchen and living area, while they divided the rest of the space into an office, closet, and bedrooms.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-gray-cabinets"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48147 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg" alt="white kitchen with gray kitchen cabinets under white countertop and farmhouse style sink after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Give a well-loved home some TLC upgrades</h3>
<p>After a year-long search for a new apartment, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/renovating-to-stay-in-a-beloved-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Igor</a> decided their sons’ schools, proximity to work, and an overall adoration for their lifestyle in Carroll Gardens were reason enough to stay in their apartment. They worked with a Sweeten general contractor to overhaul their dark kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom. The result? Open and modern spaces fit for the family of four.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="white-barn-door-large-living-room"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48146 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg" alt="white barn door in a large living room with large windows and natural wood flooring after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Combine two apartments into one home, sweet home</h3>
<p>A desire for more room led to multiple (unsuccessful) apartment searches for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe and Arvid</a>. Her dream of renovating and combining apartments finally put the hunt to an end. After contacting neighbors and finding one who was looking to move, their plan was underway. The additional square footage allowed for a third bedroom, a much larger kitchen, and an expanded living area.</p>
<hr />
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-gray-living-room-vinyl-floor"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48145 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg" alt="large gray and white living room with large windows and brown vinyl floor after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ShouldMoveOrRemodel-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Getting &#8220;upstate&#8221; light and space—with a city zip code</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney and Jim’s</a> Clinton Hill Co-op apartment lacked storage and light, which sent them on a search for a second home upstate. When they made an offer on the second property, reality hit: they needed to make their main residence work for them before taking on a new place. The couple decided to remodel, opening up the kitchen the rest of the living areas and reconfiguring storage closets to suit the family of four’s storage needs.</p>

<p>The Hamptons…the mere mention conjures up images of poolside luxury and endless summer. But what’s it really like to live—and renovate—there? If you’re considering buying a home in the East End to renovate, there are some things you should know. Luckily for you, we’ve done the homework! Read on to learn what to expect (and budget) for your Hamptons renovation costs. (Keep in mind that all projects are unique, and many variables will impact a remodel!)</p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> offers a guide to Hamptons renovation costs, focusing on four categories—cost per square foot, kitchen, bathroom, and permits. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p>Note: every expert contractor will want to have a detailed chat and inspection of your home before creating an estimate for your needs and wants.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of typical Hamptons renovation costs, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <em>Remodeling’s</em> 2023 <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full home renovation: Starting at <strong>$100 per square foot (psf)</strong> with stock materials; high-end properties start at <strong>$250+ psf</strong></li>
<li>Budget kitchen remodel: <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet</li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen remodel: <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end kitchen remodel: <strong>$75,000+</strong></li>
<li>Budget bath remodel: <strong>$20,000</strong></li>
<li>Mid-grade bath remodel:<strong> $25,000—$40,000</strong></li>
<li>High-end bath remodel: <strong>$40,000—$100,000</strong></li>
<li>Basement remodel: <strong>$25,000—$100,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: when referring to the Hamptons, we are talking about the <a href="https://www.southamptontownny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Southampton</a> and the <a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of East Hampton</a>, which both comprise many hamlets and villages. Hamlets such as Westhampton, East Quogue, or Hampton Bays lie within the boundaries of the town of Southampton. The villages of Amagansett and East Hampton are within the administrative boundaries of the town of East Hampton. So, any building permits filed will be with the offices of Southampton or East Hampton.</p>
<p>There is a season for everything, but especially in the Hamptons. <span class="s1">Usually, there is a big push before summer so that everyone can enjoy their homes before the summer is out, and everyone is very busy. If possible, start your design process in the fall and do the work in the winter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-48218 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="40" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FindLongIslandGC-1-300x20.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br><br>Hamptons home renovation costs per square foot</h3>
<p>According to experts who work in both New York City and the Hamptons, the consensus is that costs per square foot are essentially the same in both locales. As we point out in our cost guide to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/home-renovation-costs-square-foot-westchester-county-ny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Westchester County</a>, proximity to Manhattan dictates both the buyer demographic as well as real estate values. This, in turn, is reflected in the cost of renovations. As Sweeten contractor Eric points out, however, there are subtle differences between the villages and hamlets, with East Hampton being the priciest. Sweeten sees projects starting at <strong>$100 per square foot</strong> with stock materials and high-end properties at <strong>$250+ psf</strong>.</p>
<p>While renovation costs per square foot will vary depending on whether it is a gut or non-gut, and the level of finishes and custom features you require, Eric tells us that there is a starting point of <strong>$150 psf</strong> for renovations with stock materials. Luxury waterfront properties, however, start at <strong>$500 psf</strong> for high-end renovations and can exceed <strong>$1,000</strong> depending on complexity and finishes. (See <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Budget Basics: Renovation Costs Per Square Foot</a>, where we outline three levels of renovation.)</p>
<p>Additionally, cost increases over the past year have also pushed baseline budgets upwards: the price of fuel has gone up, as has general liability insurance, said Sweeten contractor Eric. “Building materials are also up from last year because of supply and demand; everyone is renovating! And when homeowners are renovating, the cost for electricians and plumbers and other subs increase, because they can pick and choose between the most profitable jobs. They will charge more now for smaller jobs like a single kitchen or bath.”</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-cost-guide-city-national-edition/">Costs for a kitchen renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget kitchen: Most budget-friendly Sweeten kitchen remodels&nbsp;average <strong>$25,000</strong> for under 100 square feet with basic finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Mid-grade kitchen: Most Sweeten mid-grade can fall between <strong>$40,000—$75,000</strong>. In Sweeten contractor John&#8217;s experience, he cites a mid-grade kitchen could average in the <strong>$75,000</strong> range.&nbsp;<a href="https://arielokin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel Okin</a>, an interior designer who works in the Hamptons, tells us: “Kitchen gut renovations can range from <strong>$40,000—$150,000</strong> depending on the level of work the client wants, and the same goes for baths. Square footage, scope of work, and estimated amount of time it will take to complete the job are all major considerations that go into pricing out the project.”</li>
<li>High-end kitchen:&nbsp;At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects cost start at <strong>$75,000</strong> for high-end finishes. According to <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2">, a major high-end kitchen remodel averages $178,347 in New York.&nbsp;</span><br>This is based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with top-of-the-line custom cabinets, stone countertops, imported tile backsplash, built-in refrigerator, microwave, commercial-grade cooktop, and vent hood, as well as all new lighting and wood floors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end kitchen in the Hamptons will start at <strong>$150,000</strong> and up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/bathroom-remodeling-costs-national-edition/">Costs for a bathroom renovation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333333;">Budget bathroom remodel: At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen projects begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. John quotes a three-piece (shower, sink, and toilet) project to average out to about <strong>$35,000&nbsp;</strong>for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Mid-grade bathroom remodel: Sweeten has completed bathroom renovations between <strong>$25,000—$40,000</strong> in the mid-range that covers about 100 square feet. </span></span><a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</a><span class="s2"> cites an average of <strong>$29,915</strong> for a mid-grade bath remodel.</span></li>
<li>High-end bathroom remodel: At the high-end range, Sweeten renovations that consist of three-pieces can cost between <strong>$40,000—$60,000</strong>. A high-end master suite remodel consisting of 4-5 pieces including a shower, double sink, bathtub, and toilet costs between <strong>$60,000—$100,000</strong>. According to Remodeling’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/middle-atlantic/new-york-ny/?bwts=1692367227"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value 2023 Report</span></a>, a high-end bathroom remodel averages <strong>$88,223</strong> in New York.

</ul>
<p>Sweeten contractor John estimates that a high-end master bath renovation would run about <strong>$100,000</strong> on average.</p>
<h3>Costs for a basement renovation</h3>
<p>At Sweeten, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://sweeten.com/category/sweeten-renovations/basement-renovations/">basement remodels</a> budgeted at <strong>$100—$150 psf</strong> or <strong>$25,000</strong> for a simple coat of paint. A gut renovation would cost <strong>$50,000—$100,000</strong> which could include plumbing, electrical, an entertainment center, appliances, closets, and with possible walls going up or down.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What to know about permits in the Hamptons</h3>
<p>Permits are a big part of the renovation process in Hamptons towns. While expediters are not regularly used there, the process can involve two types of <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/">experts not usually called upon in renovation projects</a> elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental consultants</strong> can assist homeowners and architects in parsing land use regulations, coastal environmental planning, and acquisition of related permits. Given the <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/green-remodeling-ideas-for-home/">delicate ecosystems</a> and the proliferation of wetlands and sand dunes along the coasts, these consultants are crucial to navigating this aspect of the permit process. Additionally, they can answer help determine whether you can expand the footprint of a house or add a dock. They typically charge by the hour (ranging from <strong>$250-350/hour</strong>, with a minimum project fee). For the initial site inspection and report, some offer a flat rate fee of around <strong>$1,500. </strong>This fee would cover the property inspection and produce a report.</li>
<li><strong>Local attorneys</strong> who are well-versed in the zoning codes of the particular town in question can help navigate the process. Sweeten architect Andrew tells us that East Hampton recently changed some of its codes and a local attorney assisted him and his client in liaising with the town office on a debated matter of allowable square footage. Attorneys’ fees vary; a local real estate agent can provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping up with local regulations and requirements</h3>
<p>While the town offices may be small and provide a more personal interaction, as Sweeten architect Andrew relates, don’t mistake that casual air for a casual approach to enforcing regulations. For example, certain Hamptons neighborhoods won’t allow work on weekends, or after a certain time during high season. There have also been increasing attempts to limit the square footage on properties and accessory structures that may be used as rental properties. Additionally, there are stringent regulations at the town, state, and federal levels that will affect your renovation, depending on scope.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s important to understand what the current code is. However, you should also try to find out what is upcoming or anticipated in terms of changes. Because project timelines can extend, you want to ensure you&#8217;re complying with the relevant codes when your project finishes.</span></p>
<p>One relatively recent development has been<a href="https://ehamptonny.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2224/Adopt-Local-Law-Amending-Chapter-102-to-Adopt-HERS-Rating-Energy-Conservation-Requirements-PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a change in the energy conservation requirements</a> in East Hampton, for example. Andrew notes that he is dealing with this on a current project. Now, they&#8217;ll need to hire someone who is certified to complete the HERS rating, which will cost between <strong>$1,000—$2,000</strong>. They may also need to use different building components to achieve better insulation and R-value required today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An outdoor kitchen is the ultimate al fresco space! Get ready for a ton of fun (and a good investment for your home)</h2>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" title="outdoor-swimming-pool-brown-deck" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Deck-1000-res-723x480.jpg" class="mb-10" alt="outdoor swimming pool and brown deck area with furniture after renovation" width="723" height="480" /></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Dennis</a></span></p>
<p>If you agree that the kitchen is the heart of the home, then consider bringing that sense of entertaining and relaxation outside with an outdoor kitchen. The options for an outdoor kitchen are endless—sinks, fridges, lighting, roofing, the list goes on.</p>
<p>If this sounds appealing, then you are not alone! More than 70 percent of homeowners who have outdoor space are looking to enhance the patio with the goal of making it more relaxing, according to a recent survey from American Home Furnishing Alliance. A CNN Money survey predicted the outdoor kitchen market to be worth almost $6 billion yearly.</p>
<p>An outdoor kitchen might become the cherry on top of your home renovation plans. It isn’t the cheapest project, nor a necessity, but <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines what you need to know to help you weigh your decision. Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</p>
<h3>How to schedule your outdoor kitchen project</h3>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s possible to do outdoor work at nearly any time of the year. However, weather with temperatures above freezing (minus rain and snow!) is preferred. On average, the shortest timeframe to complete an outdoor kitchen without delays or unforeseen events is 2-3 weeks. The longest average timeframe for an outdoor kitchen completion is four months. Start the process at least six months before you want to have the outdoor kitchen completed which also leaves enough time to create a good kitchen plan, advises Dennis, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Sweeten general contractor</a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<h3>How much does an outdoor kitchen cost?</h3>
<p>Like all home renovation projects, it’s best to determine what you want to spend in the beginning. Your budget will be a meeting place of your financial abilities and what you need and want. Dennis has worked on outdoor kitchens in the Philadelphia area that range in price from $15,000 to more than $100,000, which is a similar price range given by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6576#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose, a Sweeten general contractor</a> in the Miami area.</p>
<p>A lower-budget outdoor kitchen will use materials such as concrete or cement pavers for the floor, according to New York City <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Santi</a>. Pressure-treated wood for cabinetry is also another good value choice. Materials in a more expensive outdoor kitchen could be stainless steel cabinets, stone floors, and a natural stone countertop, Santi said.</p>
<p>Appliances will also take up a big chunk of the budget. Jose said you should expect to pay several thousand dollars for a grill, fridge, and other appliances that are tough enough to survive the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The national average cost of a mid-range backyard patio that includes a fire pit, small fridge, sink, gas grill, lighting, a pergola, and a 20-foot square patio on flat ground is about $56,000, according to <em>Remodeling</em>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs Value</a> report. That renovation will add over $30,000 to your home’s value. Many outdoor kitchens will start with a patio or deck that is already there, potentially bringing down the cost, according to Dennis.</p>
<h3>Design ideas for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>The layout of your outdoor kitchen can be drawn up by a kitchen designer or in a growing number of cases, a landscaper, says Dennis. Landscapers help to blend the outdoor kitchen into the overall look of your outdoor space. And of course, <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your general contractor can likely assist</a> you with the design.</p>
<p>Consider where you place the grill, sink, and fridge as they create the “work triangle” for whoever is cooking. Be sure to keep that area free of obstructions or foot traffic. The design is also an important time to look at the strength of your deck if you are not starting from scratch. Dennis advises that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/what-to-consider-before-building-or-renovating-an-outdoor-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing decks will need to be assessed</a> to determine if they can handle the added weight.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="stone-counter-granite-countertop" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45766 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg" alt="stone counter and granite countertop for outdoor kitchen after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Outdoor-BBQ-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Outdoor kitchen renovation by New York <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4277#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor John</a></span></p>
<h3>Materials used in outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>With the outdoor factor, the materials used will differ greatly from your indoor kitchen. And then factor in your style preference and budget. If a bench—a single permanent structure that encompasses countertop, storage, and appliances—is part of your design, common materials are stucco, concrete, or stacked stone, says Dennis. Quartz is also a possibility, according to Jose.</p>
<p>When it comes to cabinets, don’t install too many as you’re not going to keep a lot of plates, pots, and pans in your outdoor kitchen. Whatever you do have should be able to stand up to the winter cold and that includes pipes that drain easily for winterizing.</p>
<h3>Common outdoor kitchen appliances</h3>
<p>The staple piece of your outdoor kitchen, and likely the most expensive, is the grill. If you’re planning on installing this permanently by building it into a bench, then don’t hold back on price, Dennis advised. “You want to make sure you have a quality grill—and fridge—because if they break you aren’t going to find one that is an exact fit for the permanent structure,” he said.</p>
<p>Whether your chosen grill will use a propane tank or rely on gas lines, it will have a big impact on your budget, timelines, and permits needed. Even though you&#8217;ll need to replace a tank, you won&#8217;t need gas lines from house to patio; which saves time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Ironically, not all fridges can withstand the winter. “Some fridges cannot handle freezing weather even though that seems odd,” Dennis said. Outdoor fridges must work harder to maintain a constant temperature when the weather fluctuates. Consider high-grade stainless steel, which will reduce rust.  But don’t forget the added convenience of an outdoor fridge comes with the inconvenience of needing electricity. This will set you back a few hundred dollars, but solar energy is a possibility.</p>
<h3>Coverings for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Providing shade and shelter from the rain comes in many forms. For more extravagant outside kitchens—such as a TV for watching sports and a sound system—Dennis recommends something similar to a gazebo roof that has full coverage. There’s also lattice, which will provide some shade, but not rain cover. On the lower end of the budget scale is a retractable awning.</p>
<h3>Lighting for outdoor kitchens</h3>
<p>Have a long think about what you will use your new outdoor space for. Will you be reading? Playing cards with friends at night? Then perhaps you need more lighting over the seating area as well as where you prepare the food.</p>
<p>Hosting dinner parties? Then consider more ambient lighting that highlights architecture. And if you’re already planning on having a fridge and the electricity it needs, the lighting might be a natural progression.</p>
<h3>Plumbing for an outdoor kitchen</h3>
<p>Running water is important for cooking, so prepare to lay some pipes from your house to your outdoor kitchen. Depending upon the distance, it could cost between $600 to $1,500, according to Sweeten contractor Jose. Cold water is the only necessity here, but “if a client really wants hot water, we can explore a really small, tankless water heater,” he said.</p>
<p>Once you get the water out there, you then have to get rid of it. “You can’t put the waste water into the ground,” said Jose, “It needs to be connected back into the house’s sewer.” Use of a <a href="https://homesteady.com/info-12182622-can-use-dry-well-outdoor-sink.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dry well,</a> where water is filtered before going into the ground, might be possible, but this will depend on building codes.</p>
<h3>Tip: Prepare for permits</h3>
<p>The permitting process for outdoor kitchens can be surprisingly complicated. Not only will you need a building permit, but also an electrical permit for refrigeration. If you don’t want to use gas tank lighting, you’ll need mechanical or plumbing permits for water and gas. To avoid gas or electricity permits, clients can use a gas cylinder for the grill and solar energy for electricity, Sweeten contractor Santi suggested.</p>
<p>You may need approval from a zoning department. Dennis advises homeowners to check their local zoning codes as there may be limits on how much land you can cover with materials like concrete because rain cannot easily soak through it. There may also be restrictions on how close to the property line you can build. “It would be a waste of time to design something gorgeous and then submit it and not have it approved,” Dennis said.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving into a new house—or realizing an <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/remodeling-old-house-vintage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older home hasn’t kept up</a> with your lifestyle—can make renovation feel like a path to reinvention. However, creating a budget for a remodel is unique to every project! Budgets depend on many factors, like the materials you choose, changes in layout, or moving plumbing or gas lines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have compiled a guide to renovation costs across Westchester County, New York, focusing on four categories: kitchen, bathroom, basement, and permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting costs compiled from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> renovations and <em>Remodeling</em>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost vs. Value report</a>.</p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Westchester home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that Westchester County, with its close proximity to New York City, is one of the pricier areas when it comes to real estate. That is also reflected in the cost of renovations. <span style="color: #333333;">On average, many Sweeten projects can range from <strong>$100 </strong></span><strong>psf<span style="color: #333333;">—$250 </span>psf</strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">. Based in Westchester, </span></span></span><span class="s1"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Sweeten contractor Gregory</span></a> has worked on projects that involve multiple rooms or a gut renovation at the <strong>$250 psf range. </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anything higher, he said, “usually applies to one or more specialty trades, such as architects or engineers, and insurance costs which factors into the overall budget.” Choice of material will also affect the cost per square foot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similarly, a higher cost stems from the quality and experience of the skilled workers the contractors hire for the project. “Costs for construction vary based on experience, which increases for a higher-end result,” said a <span class="s2">Sweeten contractor,</span> who handles projects in the Westchester area. For instance, “A presentation representing the finished product—design and organizing, scheduling, and advising on the materials—is a service that adds to the budget.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing to note: While Sweeten contractors attempt to explore all avenues to stay competitive, it is an industry that is affected by trade. Therefore, the prices you’re quoted at any given time may not be the same six months or a year from now. Prices on labor and materials fluctuate and this will be reflected in your overall quote.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester kitchen renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at </span><span class="s3"><b>$25,000—$30,000</b></span><span class="s2"> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.</span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade kitchen: Expect to see starting budgets from </span><span class="s3"><strong>$40,000</strong>—<strong>$50,000</strong></span><span class="s2"> for a typical mid-grade kitchen.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s2">Westchester-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3553#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Majid</a> has worked on projects costing <b>$40,000</b> for 150 square feet, or about<b> $260 psf</b>. This budget includes mid-grade finishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2"><i>Remodeling</i>’s<a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span class="s5">Cost vs. Value report</span></a> puts <b>$350 psf</b> or <b>$70,000</b> total, as an average for Westchester County. These figures are based on a 200-square-foot kitchen with standard finishes, like an energy-efficient range, built-in microwave, and ventilation system. It also includes garbage disposal, custom lighting, and resilient floorings such as vinyl, linoleum, or cork.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2">High-end kitchen: Sweeten has seen projects start at <strong>$70,000</strong> for a high-end kitchen.<span class="s2"><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s6">In the Cost vs. Value report, the average high-end kitchen remodel cost <b>more than $137,000</b> for a 200-square foot space. </span><span class="s7">A project in that price range includes custom cabinets, built-in sliding shelves, stone countertops, and imported tile backsplashes. The appliances can include a commercial-grade cooktop and vent hood as well as high-end faucets and a water filtration system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">According to Sweeten contractor Majid, a large part of a high-end kitchen can be attributed to the cabinets. For example, one of Majid&#8217;s clients recently spent <b>$50,000</b> on fully custom European cabinets.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">How much a Westchester bathroom renovation costs</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="s2">Budget bathroom: A budget bathroom renovation, including demo, plumbing work, and new finishes, can reach </span><span class="s3"><b>$16,000</b></span><span class="s2">, said Oziel. Bathrooms in this category typically lean on big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot to source the majority of materials.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">Mid-grade bathroom: A mid-grade bathroom in Westchester County will cost on average </span><span class="s3"><b>$22,000</b>,</span><span class="s2"> according to the Cost vs. Value report, which is <b>$628 psf</b> for a 35-square-foot bathroom. This includes a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain-on-steel tub.<br /></span></li>
<li><span class="s2">High-end bathroom: Prices can start at around <strong>$32,000</strong> for a standard full bath with high-end finishes. However, homeowners are more likely to splurge for high-end in their master baths, bringing the starting cost for a typical high-end bathroom to around <strong>$46,000.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a higher budget, clients are looking at faucets that can cost $2,000 apiece, marble flooring, custom vanities, built-in medicine cabinets, a rain shower, and top-of-the-line lighting fixtures. At times, those pricey finishing materials can amount to half the budget. Whether it is budget or high-end, good general contractors can strategize with a reasonable budget to help clients achieve renovation goals.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten contractors have worked on basement renovations that cost anywhere from <b>$20,000 to $75,000. </b>A<b> $20,000—$30,000 </b>or <b>$50/psf </b>budget would update an already finished basement. This includes painting, flooring, and lighting. If the space is raw and being <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/converting-a-basement-into-a-living-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated to a finished living area</a>, the cost is around <b>$75,000</b>. For this budget, a bathroom, a kitchen, and HVAC can be added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Majid, a simple basement remodel can cost as little as <b>$50 a square foot</b>, which works out to be about <b>$40,000</b> for an 800-square-foot space. Adding a toilet or shower could increase your budget, plus any necessary work to bring the room up to code. Waterproofing and drainage can also push up a basement project’s cost. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some town regulations might require two forms of egress or natural light (by adding a door or a window) or a certain ceiling height, which means digging down and lowering the floor. An average basement conversion in Westchester is <b>$75,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. A project with this budget includes a 20×30 foot room, a 5&#8217;×8&#8242; bathroom with a shower and bar area, plus insulation and laminate flooring. This example project works out to<b> $117 psf</b>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in Westchester</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost of permits changes from town to town in Westchester County. Typically, home renovation costs will be determined by your budget, and require some basic math to figure out. For example, the permit costs below are broken out among the different towns across the County:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Pelham</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost <b>$250</b> for a project costing under <b>$5,000</b> plus <b>$12</b> per each additional <b>$1,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Scarsdale</span></span><span class="s1">: Building permits cost<b> $255</b> for a project costing between <b>$10,000</b> and <b>$50,000</b>. For projects budgeted over <b>$100,000</b>, a permit costs a flat fee of <b>$1,755</b> plus <b>$14</b> for each <b>$1,000</b> or fraction over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Katonah</span></span><span class="s1">: Permits cost <b>$14</b> for every <b>$1,000</b> of a budgeted project.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"><span class="s3">Hastings-on-Hudson</span></span><span class="s1">: The fee will cost <b>$17</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of the estimated construction cost.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These figures provide a jumping-off point for your Westchester County renovation budget.

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">UPDATED: Read our </span><span class="s1">most up-to-date New Jersey </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-kitchen-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">Kitchen Remodeling Costs</span></a> and New Jersey <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/2022-bathroom-remodeling-costs-in-new-jersey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathroom Remodeling Costs</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine million New Jerseyans live in the Garden State. And why not? There’s the option to live close to beaches, own a farm, or live the quintessential American suburban life. There’s also a convenient commute to New York City and Pennsylvania. </span><span class="s1">According to the US Census, 64 percent of the houses are owned by the inhabitants, which means there are a lot of homes available for renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Set a budget for New Jersey home renovation costs</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re embarking on a home renovation, your first stop will be creating a realistic budget so you can compare what you have to spend and what you might need to spend to get what you want. Each project will have a unique process and outcome with many variables that will increase or decrease costs. From your tastes in material and workmanship to changes in layout, many elements will impact your budget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, </span><span class="s1">Sweeten has done some of the homework for you when it comes to home renovation costs for New Jersey. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with <a href="https://sweeten.com/new-jersey-general-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetted general contractors</a>, offering advice, support, and secure payments—at no cost to the homeowner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s a breakdown of typical starting home renovation costs in New Jersey, compiled from Sweeten renovations and <i>Remodeling</i>’s <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Cost vs. Value report</span></a>. Renovators in denser areas closer to New York City will likely see slightly higher budgets. </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Full home renovation: <b>$100 per square foot (psf) and up</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen remodel: <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen remodel: <b>starting at $30,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen remodel: starting at <b>$60,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom remodel: <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom remodel: <b>$685 psf</b> or <b>$24,000</b><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom remodel and expansion: starting at <strong>$40,000</strong><br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Basement remodel: starting at <b>$20,000</b><br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But remember this: While it is great to have an idea of your end cost, a contractor will want a detailed conversation and inspection of your home before delivering a more specific estimate.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey home remodeling costs per square foot</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">New Jersey is a big state. In the northeastern part of the state, real estate prices are slightly lower than neighboring New York City. Western NJ has more affordable rural properties that give New Jersey the nickname “Garden State” for its extensive agricultural industry. The same cost variations can occur when it comes to renovating your New Jersey home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most Sweeten projects generally start at<b> $100 per square foot</b> <b>(psf)</b> in New Jersey. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3903#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Norm</a>, who is based in Northern New Jersey, has seen gut renovations start at <b>$200 psf</b> and go up from there. This cost range also includes everything from architectural design and drawings to fixtures, demolition, expediting, construction—the whole project.</span></p>

<h4>Easier logistics in New Jersey</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are fewer obstacles to a New Jersey renovation than, say, a place like New York City, according to Norm. For example, New Jersey renovations don&#8217;t normally have parking and access issues or limited hours a co-op will allow for daily construction. This can mean more efficient use of time, less hassle, and a smaller budget for clients in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House renovations can be lighter on the wallet, too. Houses typically have the upside of direct access, while apartments do not. In apartments, contractors must take extra care (and time) to keep communal hallways and lobbies clean and clear. “All those things make a home renovation much less labor-intensive than an apartment,” said Norm.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey kitchen remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<h5>Lower-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end kitchen: Sweeten kitchen remodels can start at <b>$20,000 </b>to<b> $25,000</b> for under 100 square feet with budget-friendly finishes from retailers such as Home Depot.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">One New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor</span><span class="s1"> had completed a kitchen in Monmouth County’s Fair Haven for under <b>$25,000</b> at <b>$100 </b>psf. For flooring, he used a prefinished engineered floor lumber core with a real wood veneer on the top layer. This cost <b>$2,500</b>. The cabinets were purchased ready to install and a stone counter was paired with a stainless steel undermount sink, which was quite cost-effective. A good budget number per square foot of floor space would be <b>$100</b> to <b>$150 psf</b> for economical kitchens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua, a Sweeten contractor</a></span><span class="s1"> who does a lot of renovations in Monmouth and Ocean counties, recently redid a 160-square-foot kitchen for under <b>$20,000</b>. To stick within this economical budget, he used vinyl plank flooring, a basic subway tile backsplash, and premade cabinets that come in standard measurement options like 12, 15, and 21 inches. “You can make it pretty close with those measurements, but with custom, you can make it fit exactly to what the space is,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another New Jersey-based Sweeten contractor agreed that a kitchen renovation can start at under <b>$20,000</b> for something basic (premade stock cabinets, basic appliances, etc.) and small (10’ x 10’ square feet).</span></p>
<h5>Mid to high-end budgets</h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range kitchen: Sweeten has seen mid-range kitchens start at <strong>$30,000</strong>. Joshua puts a mid-range kitchen in a range up to<b> $40,000</b>. Instead of hitting up big-box stores like Home Depot, as you would for a lower-end kitchen, this price bracket allows you to shop in specialty stores for items like tiles or cabinets, Joshua said. <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <a href="https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2020/middle-atlantic/trenton-nj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">report</span></a> puts a typical mid-range kitchen renovation at <b>$375 psf</b> or <b>$75,000</b> total as an average for Trenton, New Jersey’s capital.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end kitchen: Sweeten’s typical remodel starts at <strong>$60,000</strong>. The average cost for this level in Trenton, New Jersey, is <b>$145,000</b> or <b>$725 psf</b>, according to <i>Remodeling</i>’s Cost vs. Value <span class="s2">report</span>. </span>The largest kitchen project Norm completed in New Jersey was more than <b>$150,000</b>. Pumping up the price were items such as a kitchen island with double-thick quartz and a waterfall edge, a Wolf range, reclaimed wood beams added to the ceiling, a wine fridge, and a very large square footage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How much a New Jersey bathroom remodel costs per square foot</span></h3>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Low-end bathroom: Sweeten bathrooms can start at <b>$15,000 </b>to<b> $20,000</b> for a 5’ x 8’ space with budget-friendly finishes.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bathroom renovations can cost less if the majority of materials come from big-box stores like Lowe’s or Home Depot for porcelain tiles, a molded sink, and a fiberglass shower. “The crux of the job is always similar in terms of what you have—a toilet, a shower, tiles, vanities—then you expand your budget with what finishes you use,” Joshua said.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">Mid-range bathroom: A mid-range bathroom that covers about 35 square feet in New Jersey will cost on average <b>$24,000</b>, according to the Cost vs. Value report. This comes out at <b>$685 psf</b> and can include a recessed medicine cabinet, a standard toilet, solid-surface vanity counter, and a porcelain tub. Typically, the smaller the space, the higher the square foot cost.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">High-end bathroom: Sweeten has seen high-end bathrooms start at <strong>$40,000</strong>. That same Cost Vs. Value report puts a high-end bathroom renovation at <b>$75,000</b>, based on a bathroom expanded from 35 square feet to 100 square feet (or <b>$750 psf</b>).<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The budget of a recent bathroom that Norm worked on came to that<strong> $75,000</strong> average. “It had it all—an oversized, walk-in steam shower with body sprays and frameless glass,” he said. Additionally, it had custom carpentry and a freestanding tub, “which are very expensive,” Norm added. Then, there is the less exciting but very important work of replacing the plumbing lines. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-46406 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png" alt="Find New Jersey Contractors" width="490" height="39" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs.png 490w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CTA-Find-NJ-GCs-300x24.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for a basement renovation in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a basement remodel in the New Jersey area, expect the starting cost to begin at <strong>$20,000</strong>. The Cost vs. Value report puts an average basement conversion in New Jersey at <b>$117 psf</b>. The example project cost <b>$75,000</b> and was 20’ x 30’ with a 5’ x 8’ bathroom, shower, a bar area, insulation, and laminate flooring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a lot to take into account that will impact the budget. Sometimes the floor needs to be dug deeper to raise the ceiling height. The walls could require underpinning. Electricity and plumbing might need to be installed if there is no existing bathroom. Installation and waterproofing can be significantly costly if it is needed, as well as pumps to drain out water. Some clients just want new drywall, new doors, a new closet, and fresh paint, which could put a project near <b>$20,000.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A premium basement could cost between <b>$100,000</b> and <b>$150,000</b>, according to Sweeten contractor Norm. Clients tend to get creative with basements, from custom bar areas to cinema-style entertainment rooms. “I’ve done a lot that are geared towards homeschooling with learning nooks built underneath stairs,” he said. “Or there’s been funky, retro-style laundries with dropdown racks that fall out of the walls.” </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1">Costs for permits in New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there’s a lot of good news for New Jersey renovators when it comes to permits! A few years ago, the state eliminated the need for projects to get a permit for minor work. For example, a bathroom renovation in which fixtures are being directly replaced (often referred to as “rip-and-replace”). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Doing direct replacement — replacing the toilet or oven, old for new — will keep your costs down,” said Norm. This means plumbing and gas lines can stay as is, which can be a huge expense saver. However, for trickier renovations requiring permits, some Sweeten contractors suggest budgeting 10-15 percent of the entire project’s cost for permits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New Jersey, permits are often handled by each town and will likely be tied to the budget you submit.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In the township of <span class="s2">Teaneck</span> in Bergen County, the first <b>$50,000</b> in your renovation or repair budget will cost <b>$30</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for permits (so permits for that <b>$20,000</b> kitchen you’re planning will be about <b>$600</b>). The next <b>$50,000</b> in a budget will cost <b>$24</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work and any amount over <b>$100,000</b> will cost <b>$22</b> per <b>$1,000</b> of planned work.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">In <a href="https://www.morristwp.com/DocumentCenter/View/4041/Construction-Code-Fees?bidId=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Morris Township</span></a>, a permit will cost <b>$33—$44</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the first <b>$50,000</b> of the renovation budget and <b>$27—$33</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for the next <b>$50,000</b> and <b>$20—$28</b> per <b>$1,000</b> for a project over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s4">For <a href="https://ecode360.com/12008181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">Toms River</span></a> in Ocean County, the fee will be <b>$39</b> per<b> $50,000</b> of the estimated cost of work, add <b>$25</b> for projects budgeted from <b>$50,001—$100,000</b> and add <b>$19</b> for projects costing over <b>$100,000</b>.<br /></span></li>

			<h2>Let your fridge blend neatly into its surroundings with these paneling ideas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone wp-image-44899 size-full" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you notice in a kitchen is the refrigerator. It is big and usually holds souvenir magnets, wedding invitations, or to-do lists. With more homes featuring open-plan layouts, their size and boxy shape interfere with the visual harmony. </span>Paneling and built-ins help disguise a hidden fridge cabinet by integrating it with cabinetry. The look of the entire kitchen is unified.</p>
<p><span class="s1">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he homeowners below pulled off the ever-popular &#8220;refrigerator in cabinet&#8221; design trend with the <a href="https://sweeten.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help of their general contractors</a> from Sweeten. </span><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering advice, support, and secure deposits—for free.</span></p>
<h3>A designer seeks visual harmony</h3>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet in blue kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56510" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SWEETEN-Jenifer-Apt-16-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></h3>
<p><span class="s1"></span>Furniture designer, Mitzie and her partner, Jenifer, chose blue and white for their <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/casual-chic-dumbo-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrated kitchen</a>. The entire space was simplified and unified from what it had been—outdated with a variety of closets. After laying out mood boards and careful planning, a more pleasant transition was created since it opened to the living space. While the <span class="s2">hidden fridge cabinet</span> blends in with the kitchen cabinetry, two symmetrical closets flank the main kitchen—one is a closet, and the other hides the washer and dryer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compact size with a hidden fridge cabinet</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1">After renovating all of the rental units in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/brooklyn-brownstone-remodel-modern-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brownstone they purchased</a>, Janet and Jerry kept the 600-square-foot top unit as a pied-à-terre. Scandinavian minimalism and California casualness meant the sight lines throughout the home would have few vertical disruptions. This would apply to the kitchen too. To emphasize the open and airy studio, they hid all appliances in cabinets. The washer/dryer combo, refrigerator, and pull-out freezer all fit under the countertop.</p>
<h3>A custom touch for a fridge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinets with waterfall island and brown cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56511" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Kitchen-Island-7-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/for-an-east-hampton-beach-house-a-simple-plan-to-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Hampton kitchen</a>, homeowners Jennifer and Alex wanted to keep the redesign simple but inviting. They chose to add a large island for entertaining and splurged on a wine fridge and quartz countertops. To make the design more modern, they decided to install an integrated refrigerator, which streamlined the look of the cabinetry.</span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet finds a niche<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/SWEETEN_Ainsley_Harris_Kitchen_04-05-GIF.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ainsley and Simon’s architect discovered that the column in the kitchen was merely decorative, they came up with a plan </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-lightens-up-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tuck the refrigerator inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it and add custom panels. “You don’t look at it and think it is a fridge at all,” Ainsley said</span><b>.</b></p>
<h3>A seamless built-in</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31161 size-full" title="blue-kitchen-custom-cabinets-light-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-LaurenDeMattia-Kitchen23.gif" alt="blue kitchen custom cabinets and light floor overlooking the living area after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren’s front door led </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/jewel-space-worth-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly into the kitchen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She had to choose between a traditional entryway or a hybrid space that would add square footage to the kitchen. She chose the latter and added a seamless wall of cabinetry featuring a refrigerator in a cabinet, plus a pantry and a coat closet.</span></p>
<h3>A wall of closets<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the flow between their living and kitchen space, Tara and Brian’s contractor came up with an idea to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the refrigerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a wall already outfitted with closets. Now the refrigerator fits right in with the cabinetry, instead of jutting out in the main cooking space.</span></p>

<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet around a structural column</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22901" title="white-long-cabinets-long-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Casey-fridge-gif-no-watermark.gif" alt="white long cabinets with long steel handles diving white living room with open book shelf after renovation" width="1000" height="666" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey and Kumar’s apartment is full of </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clever storage solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize their limited space. The kitchen is one such example thanks to creative built-ins. Custom cabinetry covers the refrigerator along with a neighboring pantry, while the entire unit conceals a structural column.</span></p>
<h3>A clever closet-turned-fridge idea</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg" alt="hidden fridge cabinet with paneling in kitchen" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44899" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Roxana-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scandinavian chic was the look that homeowners Roxana and Gabriel were going for in their <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/">Long Island City loft</a>.  They turned to a Sweeten contractor who was able to update their space to match their minimalistic style. </span><span class="s1">The refrigerator, which moved from the main kitchen area into what was formerly a coat closet proved to be one of the biggest challenges. They had to find the right size appliance and custom cut the Ikea panels to fit.  </span></p>
<h3>A hidden fridge cabinet unifies the kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44900" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/David-Apt-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an open concept living arrangement was the biggest goal for this Manhattan couple. They <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-cool-and-contemporary-kitchen-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took down the dividing wall</a> between the kitchen and family room and replaced it with a custom unit with storage on both sides. It was really important to the couple that they fit a fully integrated Sub-Zero refrigerator and other standard-sized appliances. “They [general contractor team] worked with me through a few kitchen iterations until we found a great open layout that permitted full-size appliances,” the homeowner shared.</span></p>
<h3>A puzzle of panels</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40347" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1496" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-201x300.jpg 201w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Sally-Jones-Kitchen-05-600x898.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less like appliances, more like furniture—that was Sally’s directive for her kitchen renovation. Her contractor built out a wall of cabinets to hide <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the refrigerator</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pantry. A set of narrow units were designed to hold brooms and mops, too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/124884#intention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen</a> or home remodel, discuss with your Sweeten contractor how to incorporate a seamless kitchen.</span></p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to make your fridge look like a cabinet</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">There are several ways to make your fridge look like a cabinet. One way is to buy a panel-ready refrigerator, meaning a fridge that comes pre-fabricated with a panel already on the door, making it look like a set of cabinets. A built-in fridge has a depth of a typical kitchen cabinet–about 24 inches–which keeps it flush with kitchen cabinets once installed, creating a seamless look.</p>

<p><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong><u>How to hide a fridge in a kitchen</u></strong></strong></p>
<p class="schema-faq-answer">To hide a fridge in a kitchen, consider the fridge itself: can you use a built-in or panel-ready fridge? These types of appliances are created to fit seamlessly with cabinets, avoiding the typical protruding fridge look, and come with panels mounted to the front, mimicking cabinetry. Some homeowners are able to hide their fridges within decorative columns, closets, or other empty spaces within their kitchen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Six Sweeten homeowners weigh in on staying or leaving during their remodel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main points to consider when planning a renovation is how you&#8217;re going to minimize the disruption of daily life. It can be tricky if you are updating a kitchen or bathroom. Living without some elements will make surviving a renovation tough (running water, electricity, Wi-Fi), so moving out while work is being done is probably your best option. But if the renovation won&#8217;t affect your needs in a major way, then you might be able to stay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> <span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s1">Here are </span>six Sweeten homeowners who moved out—or stuck it out—during their renovation.</p>
<h3>Moving out during demolition</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="black-industrial-stairs-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44895 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg" alt="black industrial stairs leading to a living room with orange couch after renovation" width="2000" height="1333" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3.jpg 2000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carly-living-room-3-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Carly&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-loft-balcony-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new apartment</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carly had been looking—and saving—for years to buy an apartment of her dreams. So when she found this 500-square-foot co-op in Greenwich Village, she snapped it up. It was a studio with a  lofted bedroom and balcony—what more could she ask? It did need work, however. She wanted to literally raise the roof in order to enclose the loft bedroom and redo the kitchen. The entire renovation took five months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interest of surviving her renovation, Carly decided to move out during the messiest part of the process: the demolition and raising the roof.  &#8220;For much of it, though, I was there,&#8221; said Carly. &#8220;I had no kitchen for six months and lived out of suitcases.&#8221; But she doesn&#8217;t regret &#8220;slumming it.&#8221; &#8220;The money I saved on short-term housing enabled me to buy the gas stove of my dreams!&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Airbnb-hopping</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33695 mb-10 size-chrono" title="brown-wooden-floor-breakfast-nook" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg" alt="brown wooden floor for breakfast nook and living room with blue wall separator after renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-28.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label"> (<em>Above</em>) Zoe and Arvid&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment combination</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/combining-apartments-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining their apartment</a> with the unit next door eliminated the option of living at home when work began. Since the scope of work extended beyond demolishing walls and the two existing kitchens to build a new one,  Zoe and Arvid moved into a short-term sublet. The couple embarked on an Airbnb-hopping adventure when their lease ended before the work was done. They then decided to live on-site for the second half of the project.</p>

<h3>Expecting while renovating</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Lindsay and Roger's kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><br />
</a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Lindsay and Roger&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/a-kitchen-graduates-with-a-new-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated kitchen</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renovating the kitchen while nine months pregnant made getting around the apartment a challenge for Lindsay. &#8220;You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere,&#8221; she said. To make it work, she moved everything from the kitchen and living room into the nursery. For <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/the-best-renovation-advice-from-sweeten-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future renovators</a>, she recommends going away for a weekend during heavy construction.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Surviving their renovation: A couple toughs it out</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-bathroom-frameless-glass-separator"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44896 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg" alt="white bathroom with frameless glass separator for white bathtub and floating vanity after renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sharon-Bath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Sharon and Laurence&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/large-scale-tile-financial-district-bathroom-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City apartment</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharon and Laurence lived in their Financial District apartment for more than two decades before renovating their bathroom. They previously had remodeled their kitchen but were wary of redoing their bathroom. The couple only has one in their apartment so they thought it being out of commission would be tough. Sharon and Laurence ultimately decided to stay in the apartment during the renovation. It wasn&#8217;t ideal but they used a neighbor’s apartment for bathroom access. Sharon thought it was better to be living on-site to deal with potential issues quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Moving into a rental</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="large-minimalistic-living-room"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44897 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg" alt="large minimalistic living room with black framed glass door and two large windows after renovation" width="1000" height="666" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jessica-livingroom-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) The light-filled renovated <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/family-remodel-design-forward-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">living room</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For their family of five, these homeowners wanted an open and airy space. That meant renovating their Upper West Side home, adding another bedroom and bath. They also knocked down walls and updated their kitchen. They turned to Sweeten to find a reliable contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple decided to take their three boys (and two dogs) and move into a rental while the work was being done. “When I told our Sweeten contractor that we wanted to move back in before the apartment was completed, he worked with us to allow us to do that. Even though we lived there without a kitchen, there was no question that it would be worth it in the end.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Neighbors offer hospitality</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20250 mb-10 size-chrono" title="Nikki and Chris' kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Nikki_Kitchen_Bathroom-06-1-723x482.jpg" alt="moving out during a renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label"></a><span class="img-label">(<em>Above</em>) Nikki and Chris&#8217; <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/custom-cabinetry-pineapple-prints-glam-kitchen-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apartment renovation</span></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nikki and Chris had to get creative to manage the challenges of being in the space mid-construction. &#8220;Through this experience, we showered at our friends’ homes, brushed our teeth at local coffee shops, and ordered from Seamless four times a week,&#8221; Nikki said. But it was all worth it to see the daily progress and watch the couple&#8217;s vision come to life. The routine became so natural that the couple&#8217;s pug started waiting at the door each morning to greet the contractor&#8217;s team when they arrived.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>7 ideas of custom bookcases to house a collection of books—whether you own 20 or 200</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you live with a book lover, you know that one book can quickly multiply into ten. It’s the kind of proliferation that seems to grow overnight, filling shelves, tabletops, and chairs until every surface is covered in books. But you don’t have to get rid of your treasure trove to reclaim your space (thank goodness!). Instead, think storage from custom bookshelves—from built-ins and open shelving to unique designs. For everyone who’s ever tripped over an errant book that found its way onto the rug, these custom bookshelf ideas from <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners will come as a welcome relief.</p>
<h3>Statement bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-26867 size-chrono" title="built-in bookcases around the fireplace" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SWEETEN_Cat_Kitchen_Livingroom-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a>Building custom bookcases around their <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/ventless-fireplace-chimney-not-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fireplace</a> was a must-have for <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/custom-bookcases-prewar-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cat and Jordan</a>. Their generous collection of books needed a home. Looking to design a clean, modern home, built-ins and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skim coating</a> for smooth walls did the trick. The varied spines of the books bring an added bonus of color and vibrancy to their space.</p>
<h3>Custom shelves for dining rooms</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-38245 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg" alt="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, dining room, renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-06-v2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most New Yorkers would choose to add more closets to their apartment, rather than remove them. But for Sheilaja and Sergio, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a renovation goal of having a larger, open dining room</a> was impeded by two closets in the entryway. They removed the closets and nearly doubled the size of their available space for the dining room. They added custom bookshelf storage in the dining room to showcase a mix of photographs, paintings, and drawings.</span></p>
<h3>Custom bookcases add hallway organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42025 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg" alt="book shelves" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13.jpeg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SWEETEN-Jessica-Lehmann-Ash-Home-13-600x900.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooking and entertaining enthusiasts Jessica and Jesse bought their Clinton Hill co-op knowing <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/when-foodies-renovate-kitchen-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the apartment needed renovation help</a>, especially for their favorite room—the kitchen. During construction, their contractor reserved square footage from the kitchen to widen their hallway. This added space allowed them to add in a long, built-in custom bookshelf. A functional, expanded kitchen <em>and</em> more space in the foyer? That’s a renovation win-win.</span></p>
<h3>Built-in custom bookcases in a foyer</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50508 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A classic apartment problem: how to make the best use out of a small or oddly-shaped entryway. Luckily, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson Yards homeowners Jeremy and Chris</a> found a Sweeten contractor skilled in custom millwork to maximize their entryway. They solved their storage issue with a full-height bookcase with 8” deep shelves. A happy surprise: the 8&#8243; shelves hold much more than they expected!</span></p>
<h3>Wall-to-wall shelves for books, trinkets</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40479 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg" alt="living space" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said it before: the right general contractor really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make your design dreams come true</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> especially for a unique home feature. In Mimi’s case, her partnership with her contractor resulted in a custom, floor-to-ceiling, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-foot bookshelf</a> for her Gramercy apartment.</span></p>
<h3>Save space with bookcases</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20600 size-chrono" title="bookshelves in the living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SWEETEN_Casey_Apartment-14-723x477.jpg" alt="bookshelves" width="723" height="477" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>Floor space can be scarce in a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/live-large-small-apartment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio or one bedroom</a>, a fact of life that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/casey-and-kumars-clinton-hill-co-op-renovation-sweetened-part-ii-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey and Kumar</a> had accepted. Rather than building their custom bookshelves from the ground up, the couple placed them over the living room sofa. This allowed them to use the full length of the wall to fit as many shelves as possible. The storage keeps their collection organized and within reach, making it easy to grab a book for a good read.</p>
<h3>Naturally divide a room (and show off your literary collection!)</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39593 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SWEETEN-MelissaRuss-19-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/open-plan-living-when-lounging-meets-dining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open plan kitchen space</a> feel harmonious can be challenging, especially when the adjoining space is a living room. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/good-design-elevates-park-slope-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa and Russ</a> didn&#8217;t want to feel like they were always in their kitchen. To provide separation, they added a partial wall, which housed a customized, built-in bookshelf in their living room. To be complementary, their contractor built a frame for the bookshelf with a lacquer panel that matched the kitchen&#8217;s framing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The decorative trim of crown molding adds timeless character and visual appeal</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-29.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-43509 size-full" title="baseboard, crown, mantelpiece molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg" alt="Renovated dining room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jaahred-dining-09-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Molding and picture frame molding by</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-traditional-house-remodel-offers-a-dose-of-modern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten homeowner</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you satisfied with the overall look of the rooms of your house? Furniture and decor aside, does it have the character you crave? If not, consider introducing molding. The addition of trim along the ceiling, at the floor, and around doorways (even on walls) will add the depth and distinction you seek. This is true for new and old, modern and traditional houses alike. When introduced with imagination and care, molding also will boost the perceived value of a home.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 [&quot;list&quot;,{},&quot;list_item&quot;,{&quot;indent&quot;:1,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;numbered&quot;}]"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.</p>
<h3>Crown molding styles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can add trim to just about any area of a room, from ceiling to floor, and areas in between. Some molding styles will work anywhere; others are designed to fit a specific location. Here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding &#8211; Just as the name indicates, crown molding crowns the room when placed at the seam or transition between the ceiling and the wall. Styles can be very simple or highly elaborate and combined to create a unique and refined installation. You can also work with a fabricator to design and cut from wood the exact look you want, but this will cost more than pre-made (see materials and profiles below).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Casing &#8211; This trim serves to conceal the gap between the wall and the door or window frame. With regard to doorways, it also helps to stabilize the opening, so this is one trim you don’t want to skip. Casing and baseboard should match or closely resemble each other for a cohesive look that doesn’t dominate a room (particularly one with a crown molding).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-42943 size-full mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg" alt="Old house open concept" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kyli-Dining-Room-2-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><em>(<span style="color: #76808f;">Above)</span></em> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyli and Luke&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">picture frame molding jazzes up plain walls straight up the stairwell</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chair rail &#8211; Functioning as both decoration and protection, a chair rail resides about halfway up a wall to protect the surface from dings from furniture placed close by. Decorative options abound here. As a natural separator, the areas above and below the chair rail may be painted a different color, or covered with wood paneling or wallpaper. Another practical benefit: if an area needs to be repaired, you don’t have to replace the surface material—paint or wallpaper—on the entire wall for a perfect match. You can just replace the damaged material above or below the molding.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Panel molding &#8211; This decorative molding is used to trim out raised-panel wall construction. Beadboard and wainscoting are a couple of examples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Picture frame molding &#8211; This molding serves two types of applications. Use it to create a frame (or frame within a frame) on a wall, which can be further defined with paint, fabric, or wallpaper. Or run it along walls near the ceiling to support hooks for picture wires, eliminating nail holes in the wall.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-25575 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-05.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/brooklyn-brownstone-sets-modern-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazli and Larry&#8217;s</a> <span style="color: #76808f;">p<span class="s1">anel molding, painted a deep teal blue, gives their dining room personality.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Baseboards &#8211; Besides casing, this trim is the most common. It sits at the juncture between the wall and the floor. The purpose is twofold: to protect against shoe scuffs and to give the floor a finished appearance, hiding any separation that may occur as the room settles. You can go narrow or wide here, as your taste and the room’s style dictate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Medallions &#8211; Typically used to conceal the opening through which a light fixture such as a chandelier descends, medallions are also decorative. Available in a range of sizes, apply one or several for pure embellishment on a wall, as an alternative to art.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use decorative crown molding</h3>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding most commonly runs along the perimeter of two surfaces to conceal or soften the appearance of the transition between them. Think window frames or crown moldings, described above.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It can also be applied to pleasing and elegant effect to top cabinets or a bookcase, for a built-in, bespoke look.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding that is at least a couple inches deep can also serve as a wall shelf or plate rail in a kitchen.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Go even deeper and you can employ molding for a fireplace mantel.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Drop crown molding a few inches from the ceiling and light it for an extra touch of drama in a living or great room, or a romantic glow for a dining room. There are two-piece molding systems available with lights in the lower molding that project upward, illuminating the upper piece. Your contractor can help you create a similar effect with a strip of LED lights.</li>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Crown molding materials and profiles</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding is widely available through stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s as well as lumberyards and some hardware stores. You’ll find a vast selection of profiles—the shape or contour that you see when the molding is seen from its side—from crisp, straight edges to sensuous, elaborate curves. Stock items come in six- or eight-foot lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Patterns &#8211; what you see from the front—include classic dentil and egg-and-dart, as well as floral and abstract designs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for what molding is made of, the most popular options include wood, of course, as well as MDF, plaster, and plastic. All of these materials can be painted, and the woods can be stained.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Wood &#8211; Wood molding comes in a variety of species, some hard like maple, and some soft like pine. Go for wood if you want to match walls of the same species or seek an effect from a distinctive grain, like that found in fir or oak. Wood takes stains, varnishes, clear coating, or paint. Some manufacturers will offer wood molding pre-primed and ready for painting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an authentic, historic look, check out salvage outlets for reclaimed wood molding from old, deconstructed houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a natural material, wood will respond to changes in humidity so it’s not for rooms with a lot of moisture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28322 size-chrono" title="medallion molding" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg" alt="crown molding" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Kavi_Kitchen_Bathroom-01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> </span><span class="s1"><span style="color: #76808f;">An elaborate ceiling medallion takes the contemporary edge off this hyper-modern kitchen in</span> <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/new-kitchen-bathrooms-fashionable-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavi and David&#8217;s</a><span style="color: #76808f;"> historic townhouse. Original molding frames the doorway.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">MDF &#8211; Made of wood fibers and resin, medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is a stable yet flexible material, suitable for surfaces that are not completely flat or even. It resists water better than wood and is lighter than plaster but heavier than the plastic options. It should come pre-primed, ready to paint or finish once installed.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plaster &#8211; A time-honored molding material going back a couple centuries, plaster offers lots of choice in ornate designs. Since it’s also heavy and rigid, it’s not good for rooms where walls are not plumb. For experienced installers only!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Plastic &#8211; There’s a range of options within plastics—polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC. All are flexible to conform to rooms with curves. They are also lightweight, and hence easier to handle than plaster and some woods. Of particular importance, plastics are waterproof, and so will not expand, constrict, split, or warp from exposure to changes in temperature or moisture, such as a kitchen or bath. They are also easy to cut and come ready to paint or faux finish.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Metal &#8211; This material is for rooms with stamped metal ceiling panels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to install crown molding</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are an experienced DIYer, it’s best to work with a pro when selecting the size of crown molding for a particular application. First, you or the contractor will need to match the molding to your home’s era and décor. Note that mid-century architecture, in its drive to streamline, did away with most ornamentation. Because of this, it will be hard to find crown molding examples from this time. However, very simple trim—molding, baseboard, and casings—can enhance even a very contemporary or minimal space to make the room feel truly finished. Here, paint the trim the same color as the walls.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pick the right crown molding for your home</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>The array of styles and range of materials make molding a simple and fairly thrifty addition to a room—once you’ve made your selection! It can transform a room without requiring you to move a single wall or replace a bit of furniture. <span class="s1">If your home has a historic or traditional heritage, you have much more leeway for choosing different types of molding, including very elaborate styles. Look at pictures of historic homes online or in books for period-appropriate inspiration and guidance.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="mb-0 alignnone wp-image-49070 size-full" title="beveled subway tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg" alt="bathroom with black subway tile in the shower" width="800" height="534" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-27-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<h3>Floor tile from modern country and classic to monochrome</h3>
<p class="p1">While it’s most important for bathroom floor tile to be functional, finding the right design style is what gives the room its personality. Fortunately, the cost of bathroom tile presents a wide spectrum of shapes, colors, and finishes. From the penny round to cement tile, increase or lower the design volume to match your vision.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some top looks from our Sweeten bathroom renovations—along with pricing info—to guide your search. The price points below fit a wide range of budgets—from $2 per square foot for a classic ceramic and $18+ for a more handmade look to $30+ for a marble mosaic.</p>

<h3>Herringbone tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p>(<em>1st photo</em>) Kyli and Luke&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/1920s-house-remodel-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black herringbone tile</a>; (<em>2nd photo</em>) Karun&#8217;s <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/bathroom-renovations/concrete-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industrial bathroom</a>; (<em>3rd photo</em>) Greenwich Village <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-greenwich-village-loft-gets-a-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loft bath</a></p>
<p class="p1">The herringbone floor tile pattern can easily be the featured focal point in the bathroom. Choose a neutral and the design still delivers dimension and texture. Or opt for a bolder hue for more impact. In a variety of sizes and colors, the tile is popular in marble, porcelain, and ceramic between $4.25–$50 per square foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kyli and Luke renovated their bathroom in their 1920s house and used materials that would last. They designed the room to be stark and graphic. Black porcelain tile with black grout produced the artisanal effect they wanted. Sweeten homeowner Karun brought a modern industrial look to his bathroom. A marble herringbone floor tile softens the edgy raw feel overall. In a Greenwhich Village loft, marble is a main feature in the kitchen. The homeowner followed suit with marble in the bathroom with a larger-format herringbone.</p>
<h3>Cement tile</h3>
<div></div>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with cement black and white floor tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56693" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Master-Bathroom-25-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<p class="p1">Cement tile, or encaustic, is durable and its texture has more grip underfoot. Therefore, it is a safe and good-looking choice for the bathroom. Made from natural materials, cement tiles are also porous so they need to be sealed properly. Sweeten homeowners Mitzi and Jenifer installed the same federal blue floor tile in their master and guest bathrooms: one in a stacked bond pattern and the other in a herringbone.</p>
<p class="p1">Plenty of linear shapes coordinate nicely in artist Katy Garry’s master bath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Her Sweeten renovation mixed glossy subway tile with graphic cement floor tile in primarily black neutrals. These tiles can cost between $10–$18 per square foot for an 8” x 8” tile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h3>Ceramic tile</h3>

<p><span class="s1"></span>Ceramic tile is a versatile choice if you’re looking for solids, patterns, or the look of natural materials like marble or slate. Its water-resistant qualities make it function well in the bathroom. <span class="s1"></span>Brooke and Sam fashioned a perfectly balanced style in their powder room. Wood-looking ceramic tile was the right neutral to complement a black-and-white floral wallpaper in a large-scale pattern.</p>
<p class="p1">Initially, Nicole thought she wanted an all-white bathroom for her basement. She decided, however, to let this room give the bottom floor the personality it was missing. Thanks to her Sweeten contractor, she had guidance with material selections. So, Nicole settled on a 16” x 16” patterned gray ceramic floor tile. Depending on shape and color, <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>expect to spend between $3.50–$40 per square foot.</p>

<h3>Hexagon tile</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-45008 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg" alt="hexagon bathroom floor tiles" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SWEETEN-Tara-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Tara and Brian&#8217;s bath, dark hexagon tile paired with light grout grounds the design and gives it a modern vibe.</p>
<p><span class="s1"></span>A Sweeten homeowner in Prospect Heights chose classic white on white for her bathroom renovation. Except for a few modern black finishes, her marble hex floor tile has the graphic pattern of a honeycomb. Expect prices to be between $5–$45+ per square foot. <span class="s1"></span>Marble and ceramic start at around $15 per square foot, and porcelain at $10.</p>
<h3>Penny tile</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg" alt="cost of bathroom tile with gradient blue and white penny tile" width="800" height="534" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-56694" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16.jpg 800w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/KatyGarry-Goldfish-Bathroom-16-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29227 " title="mosaic penny tile" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SWEETEN_Michael_Bathroom-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="bathroom tile costs" width="769" height="1151" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><br />
(<em>Top photo</em>) Katy&#8217;s blue <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/a-hamptons-bays-beach-house-renovation-gets-a-pop-art-redo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">penny bath tile</a>; (<em>b</em><em>ottom photo</em>) <a href="https://sweeten.com/spotlight/penny-tile-beige-bath-blue-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel and Michael’s shower</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Penny tile is a classic option that gives off major vintage vibes. The goldfish artwork, created by artist and Sweeten homeowner Katy Garry, inspired the dappling of gradient white and blue penny tile. It covers her bathroom from floor to ceiling invoking the sense of being in the water. In Brooklyn, Rachel and Michael’s shower renovation transformed it into a waterfall mosaic. Penny tile is a type of inexpensive floor tile, costing as little as $5 per square foot for white porcelain. The price increases to $18 or more for colorful mosaics.</p>
<h3>Basketweave</h3>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Basketweave is truly old-school, but it’s been making a steady comeback. For example, in Tina and Fletcher&#8217;s master bathroom, it feels surprisingly modern as part of the minimalist design. In Tara and Mike’s bath, the tile lends itself to a more traditional look without making the space feel dated. Porcelain, a material used in inexpensive bathroom tile, can cost around $8 per square foot; high-quality marble begins around $30 per square foot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Dining in style, from kitchen tables to islands with seating</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eat-in kitchen, the “eat-in” part is usually the last piece of the puzzle. Kitchen design typically revolves around cooking while the notion of dining in the space is often an afterthought. However, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a renovation platform connecting homeowners to a vetted general contractor, has seen a growing trend in considering both activities during the design stage. While small spaces demand multiple functionality in the kitchen, a more thoughtfully layout combines seating, a more organic flow, and space planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the possibilities that these Sweeten homeowners undertook with their eat-in kitchens, from dining tables to counter seating. All will invite family and friends to &#8220;break bread&#8221; with you at home!</p>
<h3>A kitchen banquette beckons for company</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43214" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg" alt="kitchen banquette" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jennifer-Duplex-04-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>With only one window in the kitchen to let in light, <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/duplex-remodel-first-time-renovators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenn and Jon</a> took steps to create a brighter atmosphere for their family of four. A partial wall that sectioned off an eat-in area from the kitchen came down effectively joining the two spaces and letting the sunshine stream in. Cooking and eating together were top priorities and a U-shaped banquette lent a cozy gathering spot around the square-shaped dining table. Wallpaper and paneling give it separation and personality.</p>
<h3>A peninsula bar multitasks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41636" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="dining nook" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SWEETEN-Elizabeth-Giardino-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kitchen-renovation-riverdale-bronx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth and Martin</a>’s 124-square-foot galley kitchen, tackling the space planning and bringing a sense of openness was done with the help of their Sweeten design-build team. The couple&#8217;s comfort level for all of the renovation changes was put at ease with “sketches from every angle.” Pulling down two partial walls was step one in bringing in more light. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new peninsula bar seats four to five stools reminiscent of a cute bistro—and holds storage. Form and function increase with more prep space, glass-front cabinets, and a mix of finishes. Clutter minimizes with the microwave tucked behind a cabinet and the paper towel holder rolls out from under the countertop.</span></p>
<h3>More function for a larger kitchen</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42916" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg" alt="Townhouse renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jill-kitchen-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/apartment-vs-house-a-brooklyn-family-decides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill and Cy</a> created an open concept on the first floor of their single-family townhouse. The kitchen was expanded for the family of four by turning a full bath into a powder room giving more exposure to the black-trimmed doors leading to the backyard. With ample room, a dining table and chairs fit easily in the cook space for meals and entertaining. The flat-panel walnut cabinetry, ceiling light fixture, and furniture displayed the mid-century modern aesthetic. A cut-out window seat that doubles as storage was a bonus feature.</span></p>
<h3>Centerstage for an island</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40332 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg" alt="kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Tara-Hereich-Apt-08-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span class="s1">A salvaged slab of walnut picked up at a reclaimed wood supplier took centerstage in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/walnut-co-op-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tara and Brian</a>’s kitchen. “I remember when I was a kid, the kitchen island was the center of existence,” she said. Aiming for the rustic look, two sides were live edge while the wood’s cherry red tone was lacquered. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">The refrigerator was relocated within a row of existing closets off the kitchen proper creating a unified flow for the rest of the apartment. A disguised pantry covered in subway tile is a fun “Where’s Waldo?” moment. And that walnut slab? There was enough left over to fashion open shelving for the kitchen, home office, and the bathroom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42357" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg" alt="studio loft kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/loft-kitchen-Sergei-Gorbylev-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A kitchenette found new life in its studio loft with new <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/midtown-remodel-industrial-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homeowners Serge and Uldis</a> who worked to make full use of all of the space available. Situated underneath the loft, a small dining table and chairs enhance the cozy grotto feel. Opting for an L-shaped layout, appliances moved along the back wall giving room to install plenty of countertop surface. A mix of stainless steel and white cabinets are backdrops to a glossy black tempered glass backsplash. </span></p>
