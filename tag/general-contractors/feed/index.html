<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47492" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GCCover-Graphic-Different-1.jpg" alt="why is Sweeten different" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GCCover-Graphic-Different-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GCCover-Graphic-Different-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GCCover-Graphic-Different-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> matches general contractors with high-quality home renovation projects, vetted for readiness and appropriate budget. Contractors win through a competitive bidding process, and pay only when they win. Budgets start at $15,000, with an average of $80,000.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Pay Only-When-You-Win business model</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You only pay us when you win a job. Sweeten doesn&#8217;t charge you to sign up with us, and we don’t charge you for leads. Our fee is a small percentage of the total contract value. Most contracting firms consider it a business development expense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is this important? We only get paid when you get paid. It doesn’t serve us to waste your time by sending you dozens of low-quality leads, or by sending the same leads to dozens of random contractors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten cares about your success—we consider you a partner.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Highest Quality Projects</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We only send you legitimate, transformative renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/contractors/what-types-of-renovations-does-sweeten-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects that require multiple trades</a>. We won’t waste your time with single-trade jobs or handyman tasks. Our minimum budget is $15,000. Our average contract value is $67,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All leads we send you are vetted for readiness and appropriate budget.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Vetted Leads, Matched to You</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we send you a lead, it will match your geographic service area, the types of services you offer, and your preferred budget range. </span></p>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Streamlined Competitive Bidding Process</span></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">You’ll compete with just 2 to 4 other contracting firms for each job. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">If you and the client express interest in each other, we give you tools to help with messaging, site visit scheduling, video site visits, and hiring. </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">On the client side, we help them understand and compare estimates, to help them make the best choice—even if it’s not the lowest bid.</span><span class="s1"> </span></li>
<li class="p2"><span class="s1">We minimize the time you spend on unpaid work. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p2"><span class="s1">Services to Help Contractors Grow</span></h4>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sweeten also helps contractors by giving you a dedicated account manager to help with business development and marketing. They&#8217;ll also help make your Sweeten profile and portfolio as competitive as possible. We offer opportunities for free photography and social media promotion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We stand behind your work, by offering financial protection to your Sweeten clients. They’ll be able to hire you with confidence and peace of mind. </span></p>

<h5><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved to the United States in 1999 after completing my military service in Israel as an officer. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founded my general contracting firm in 2001.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovating your home anywhere, especially in New York City, is definitely not an easy task; even for the most seasoned pros. Here are the five biggest challenges we find:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hurrying through the planning phase: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting demolition, be certain your plans, specifications, and details are worked out in precise detail. Before any hammer hits any wall, you and your contractor should do a thorough walkthrough of the space.</span></li>
<li><b>Getting only one proposal or going with the cheapest bid: </b>You should never accept the first proposal you receive. Compare at least three different contractors. Always remember: if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
<li><b>If your project is a gut job, consider hiring an interior designer: </b>If your kitchen remodel is a full gut and includes tile, stone, cabinets, and paint, then you will benefit by hiring a designer.</li>
<li><b>Spending money in the wrong places: </b>Make the best use of your budget and reserve the largest amounts for the spaces and features you’ll use regularly. This could be a large countertop or a great cooktop. Remodel the lesser-used areas with simpler finishes like lighting and backsplashes.</li>
<li><b>Living in the apartment during the renovation, or moving back too soon: </b>You’ll have plenty of stress while overseeing your renovation, but living in the midst of it all will multiply that stress.</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we begin working with you, they should think about the goals they want to achieve. Is stellar design the driving force? Improved functionality? Resale? Perhaps you’re looking for energy-saving ideas? Or maybe it’s a combination of all these elements? They should also know their budget. Developing a budget range will help you make decisions when you are choosing materials and appliances.</span></p>
<h5><b>What’s the number one thing clients should know before starting a renovation? </b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As contractors, we’ve learned a lot of lessons on the do&#8217;s and don’ts of construction. The number one thing is to be a confident decision-maker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all want our remodel to move forward with as few problems as possible. Make as many decisions about your project before the work actually starts. A good contractor will always discuss a list of possible situations that might come up on your renovation project. Their project manager Nick said, &#8220;Most of the problems are usually connected to choices about small things such as faucet selection, paint, or trim.” These may seem small and unimportant when you start your project. If your faucet is two weeks late because of shipping, your plumber will have to be rescheduled.  This can balloon into a week delay on a four-week project.</span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite architectural building?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub is my all-time favorite. I love his work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&#8217;s organic and always feels like his structures could be a skeleton for something that was once alive. </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite neighborhood?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My all-time favorite neighborhood in New York is Greenwich Village. It has pre-war buildings, thriving arts and a foodie scene,.Greenwich Village was and continues to be full of cultural and artistic edge.   </span></p>
<h5><b>What is your favorite NYC borough?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manhattan, although I complain about many aspects of it, like the traffic.  However, I really feel that it’s the greatest city in the world. Despite popular attractions like Central Park or Radio City Music Hall, there is so much more to the borough. Manhattan has classic bars, charming neighborhoods, hidden green spaces, and trendy boutiques.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-44397 mb-10" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SWEETEN_MyHome.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><span class="img-label"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoel has been a Sweeten general contractor since February 2015.</span></i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">The 5 factors general contractors should consider when picking a site to partner with</span></h2>
<p><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48301 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SurviveToThrive-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />Now is the time to be careful about which jobs you consider, estimate, and take on. Whether you’re looking to grow your business, provide consistency, or focus on niche projects, it’s important to have the right tools to help prioritize your funnel and be more efficient with your time. We encourage you to consider the unique needs of your general contracting business when evaluating the different kinds of business development sites/lead generation for contractors (of course we’re biased and think <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> is the best!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are the top five factors to consider when choosing a lead generation site to partner with:</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1"><b>1. Does the site charge you upfront, or only if you sign the job?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three basic ways that lead generation platforms can make money: </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-to-play: The platform charges you for every potential client they send your way. Costs vary depending on the size of the potential project or quality of the lead. Sites like HomeAdvisor and Porch operate with this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-for-placement: the platform charges you for better or more frequent placement on their site. The platform typically also charges either an annual/monthly fee or a fee for every potential client they send your way. Sites like Houzz and Angi follow this model.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win: The platform charges you only when you sign a contract with the potential client. The fee is typically a percentage of the project value. Sites that follow this model are considered true marketplaces, because money doesn’t change hands unless there’s a sale of services. Sweeten is one of the only sites that takes this improved approach.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pay-per-win platforms tie their success to their contractors’ success. These platforms are incentivized to help their GCs win more jobs, as opposed to the other models, which make their money whether or not you succeed. With Sweeten, you only pay when you win a Sweeten project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Tip</b>: Make sure you keep track of your return on investment (ROI) with any lead generation platform you may be considering. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>2. Does the site focus on serious renovation projects that require a general contractor, or on handyman tasks?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before signing up with a platform, find out the average size of its projects. Look for a focus that aligns with the work you do, and the work you’re seeking. Many platforms specialize in projects that average just a few thousand dollars. At Sweeten, our average project size in 2019 was $126,000. About 50% of our contracts were over $50,000. Our minimum project size is $15,000. We can win you the kinds of leads that are most profitable, rather than stretching your resources thin with distracting singe-trade work. </span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>3. Does the site focus on the quality or the quantity of remodeling project leads?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask a representative how many leads you would typically see from the platform in a month as well as how they qualify those projects. Sweeten prescreens</span><span class="s2"> every project to make sure its scope and budget align with rates in your area</span><span class="s1">. We also educate potential clients on cost, scope and process, in order to manage expectations from the start. In addition, we support your firm on the project from introduction until the punch list is complete—because your client is our client, and your success is our success. You’ll have a dedicated Sweeten account manager who can offer support during project milestones, and help with any communication problems with our shared clients. And you’ll have access to your Sweeten dashboard, with digital tools for scope support, estimate creation, e-contracts, and digital payments.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>4. Does the site vet its contractors?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Look for a platform that cares about quality and is committed to improving the renovation process for all parties involved. If you carry a home improvement or general contractors license, insurance, and other certifications, look for a platform that sets you apart from less qualified tradespeople. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Sweeten, we vet every contractor who applies to our network. We accept fewer than 20%. All qualified contractors carry the proper licenses and insurance for their service area, and have a proven record of quality craftsmanship and successful projects. As a Sweeten partner, you’re part of a group of highly-qualified, talented, experienced professionals.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span class="s1"><b>5. Does the platform encourage healthy competition?<br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How many contractors does the platform send to each lead? Are contractors segmented by skill set, company size or services offered? Look for a platform that helps differentiate your firm from the pack! Sweeten matches each project to 3-5 general contractors who are a strong fit, based on the project type and scope. Clients love this because it offers them a manageable number of relevant choices, rather than bombarding them with dozens of questionable ones. Contractors love this because when we match you to a project, you’ll probably find it attractive. And you’ll have a genuine chance of winning. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What sets Sweeten apart from the rest?</span></h3>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten’s digital platform makes managing projects easier</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweeten’s combination of smart technology and client service means real renovations with real budgets. Our advanced matchmaking service matches each prospective project only to the most compatible general contractors. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sweeten gets to know you and your firm’s strengths for the best fit</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a Sweeten general contractor, you won’t be thrown into a large pool of firms fighting for one project. You’ll get only qualified leads specifically suited to <i>your</i> firm. Sweeten is the best lead-generation source because it provides viable leads, a “pay only when you win model,” and dedicated support to help you succeed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>They stepped up to make the renovator’s experience the best it could be</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you post your project on <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, you get the guarantee of a contractor who’s licensed, vetted for their quality of work, and matched to your specific renovation. Sweeten general contractors are there to manage your project from start to completion and make sure you not only have the finished product of a home, sweet home, but a smooth experience getting there, too. While there may be bumps in the road, it&#8217;s the experience that a good contractor has to navigate the potholes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re impressed every day by the work the contractors in our network do! Ahead, we highlight a few of many instances where Sweeten contractors came through for their renovators in a big way.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40489" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SWEETEN-Mimi-Wu-Apt-12-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Mimi’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/first-timer-gramercy-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When the homeowner had a vacation booked. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was especially glad I found a contractor I could trust because I had actually preplanned a three-week-long vacation overseas before I knew I was going to be in the middle of renovations (and ended up breaking my phone two days in!). I was a bit nervous leaving right in the middle of all of the construction, but my Sweeten contractor gave me a lot of confidence that the project could proceed without me. So I picked out all of the finishes I wanted, ordered the fixtures, packed my bags and left right in the middle of the project. Sure enough, by the time I got back, the job was nearly complete!”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40775" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg" alt="living room" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SWEETEN-Gayle-Malone-Home-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Gayle’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/queens-childhood-home-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When family comes first.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I never felt like I was out of the loop on what was going on with our contractor and his team. Even when our mom became ill one month into construction, we didn’t have a lot of time to talk to him or meet with him, but our back and forth communication had been so great before that he was able to just keep going, handling all of the small decisions and only calling if there was a major decision that needed our input. It was a relief that the work didn’t stop.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-drawers"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33665" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets and drawers with brushed steel faucet and sink near window after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-Gloria-Fraczak-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Gloria’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/reno-finds-light-end-tunnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When they acted as a “neighbor whisperer.” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general contractor went door to door with his client to alert neighbors of a plumbing situation, relieving the client of her anxiety and showing enormous support: “Our contractor went with us to each unit to explain what would happen even though they were not the ones replacing the plumbing. Magically, we easily got everyone’s agreement once they were told the entire situation.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-40909" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SWEETEN-Allyson-Martinez-Apt-02-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowner Allyson’s renovation completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/eclectic-bathroom-renovation-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When the homeowner had a very clear vision.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allyson’s plan for her bathroom was anything but cookie-cutter and involved a lot of coordination to ensure the materials were the right size and came in on time. “My contractor was patient and never dismissed my ideas as ridiculous or impossible. If something wasn’t how I liked it, he made sure that it was corrected. Because a lot of the items I wanted to use came from outside of the country, he worked around my undependable delivery schedule.  He took a potentially stressful situation and provided steady guidance and expertise.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" title="kitchen-living-ding-in-one-stock"  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41453" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg" alt="open kitchen living and dining in one stock space and large window and hardwood floors and oak and white kitchen cabinets after renovation " width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SWEETEN-Roxana-Zegan-Kitchen-01-1-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>(Above)</em> Homeowners Roxana and Gabriel&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> renovation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed by a </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/ikea-kitchen-long-island-city-loft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten general contractor</span></a></p>
<p><b>When a renovation required a little “hacking.” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana and Gabriel wanted to make a lot of modifications to an Ikea kitchen system—including integrated appliances. The couple spent so much time searching for a refrigerator that could fit into what was formerly a coat closet, and their contractor cut custom panels to cover it. “Our contractor was very patient with all my crazy ideas and helped me make them actually work. He helped brainstorm a lot of the Ikea ‘hacking’ and was very patient with us.”</span></p>

<p><b>Where are you from and how long have you been in construction?</b></p>
<p>I’m from Albania, and I’ve been in construction for eight years.</p>
<p><b>What do you love most about what you do?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love to see my clients&#8217; satisfaction when I transform their apartments, when they’re happy at the end, and they’re excited to see their new space. When my clients are happy—that’s my favorite thing about what I do. </span></p>

<p><strong>What is the biggest challenge about renovating in New York?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge would be working with management companies. That is the biggest challenge, getting the board approvals and things of that nature. Clients sometimes are not aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest misconception that homeowners have when starting a renovation project?</strong></p>
<p>Budget. Clients need a better understanding of what the projects cost. I do love explaining that to them and sharing that with them. Also, Sweeten does a great<b> </b>job, too.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want all of your clients to know before you work with them?</strong></p>
<p>What I want my clients to know is that they aren’t working with a designer or architect, they should at least have a vision of what they want in their projects. I want them to be realistic about their visions and expectations.</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite New York City building?</b></p>
<p>The Empire State Building is very special to me. My cousin took me there when I was 8 years old. I had never seen anything like it before. We took another family member from Albania there too.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite New York City restaurant?<br />
</strong>Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-renovations-fools-gold-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fool&#8217;s Gold renovation</a> by <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Sweeten general contractor</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a business owner, once a business plan and financing are ready, and a space for your office, <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/cost-breakdown-restaurant-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restaurant</a>, or retail space has been identified, the next crucial step is understanding the commercial lease itself. Having the right team—a commercial real estate broker and an attorney—who specializes in negotiating leases for commercial spaces will help advise what should be included in the lease document to protect you and your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching business owners with vetted general contractors, consulted the experts to define these elements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, a landlord provides the first version of the lease, which will (obviously) favor the landlord and is often derived from a template. Oftentimes, the landlord will use a template. Commercial real estate broker with Compass, Alex Cohen, explains, “The commercial real estate advisor negotiates all the key business terms on behalf of a tenant before a lease is prepared or an attorney is engaged by the tenant. Once a lease is drawn, the advisor can confirm all of the agreed business terms are accurately conveyed in the lease and can assist the attorney in the negotiation of legal terms.” While the lease should include everything previously discussed in the term sheet, your attorney should perform a close review, checking that you are clear on the terms and making any necessary adjustments so that the lease is more favorable to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something to keep in mind: There are important differences between residential and commercial agreements. If you are familiar with residential leasing, you may make (incorrect) assumptions about commercial leases based on that experience. One major difference is that residential renters have rights under the law—to heating and repairs, for example. In a commercial tenancy situation, the landlord does not have to provide heat or make repairs unless it is stipulated in the lease. Read on for the specifics of what is typically included in a commercial lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Base rent, steps, and escalations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rental amount on a commercial lease is calculated via several variables. You are responsible for a base rent, which is the minimum amount of rent you pay. This is often calculated on a yearly basis and based on the rent per rentable square foot, a term explained below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For office tenants in New York, the square footage for which a business pays rent can be 30% to 40% greater than the square footage on which carpet can be laid and furniture installed. Rentable square feet for <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/office-renovation-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office space</a> is usable area, plus a portion of the common areas adjusted by a market loss factor. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-guide-retail-renovation-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retail space</a>, however, is generally marketed and leased on a usable square foot (the actual square footage of space that is available to the tenant for its business use) basis. Loss factors are higher for partial-floor office spaces than for full-floor occupancies, because common areas like corridors, elevators, and lobbies are apportioned on divided floors into each tenant’s square footages. This means full floors are usually more efficient and cost-effective than partial-floor occupancies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to fixed increases in the base rent—typically every five years and referred to as &#8220;rent steps&#8221;— various mechanisms (“escalations”) exist that adjust the rent to be paid by the tenant during the term of the lease. Landlords want to ensure that they will continue to generate profit and will want the tenant to bear at least part of the responsibility for increased operating costs and higher taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Additional rent for utility charges and services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In New York City, base rent does not usually include electricity service. Utilities are usually charged by submetering, or through rent inclusion (though if you are fortunate, your space will have a separate meter and you pay the actual cost of electric usage directly to Con Edison). If your commercial space is not individually metered, you will have to buy electricity from the landlord, who usually marks it up. In submetering, you will pay a monthly electric charge (plus markup) to your landlord. With rent inclusion, the landlord includes a fixed charge for electricity lumped onto the rent, calculated per rentable square foot. This is a prime area for negotiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other utilities such as water, gas, and heat, may be included in the rent or sub-metered. Typically this is decided based on building configuration and usage—if it is low, the landlord is usually happy to include it in the rent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also note that if the utilities are shared in the building, the landlord is only responsible for providing the utilities in the hours stated in the lease. For example, if you need to use the heat after hours, you may have to negotiate that separately and pay additional after-hours charges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another area of consideration is cleaning services for your rented space. There are typically three options: 1) landlord includes the service as part of the rent; 2) landlord has a preferred vendor who you pay out-of-pocket; or 3) you obtain cleaning services on your own (or clean the space yourself!).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Terms of the lease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In commercial real estate, a “short-term” lease is considered anything under five years, whereas a “long-term lease” is anything longer than five years and often for a 10-plus year period. You will decide what kind of lease works for your business based on how stable it is, and how long you think the location will work for your business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In tandem with the length of the lease, also pay close attention to the assignment and subletting rights. If you need the flexibility to assign or sublet your space, in case you need to move your business or unexpectedly close it, then you want to make sure the process is not unnecessarily onerous. Every lease requires the landlord&#8217;s consent to sublease unless you are renting desk space to another firm and this is permitted in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lease concessions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is common for leases to include a rent-free period and a tenant improvement allowance (TIA) for use during the contractor build-out of the interior, particularly if the landlord is providing a raw space. Alternatively, the landlord might choose to renovate on behalf of a tenant, subject to their requirements; rent typically commences when the tenant assumes occupancy of the finished space. During times when the market favors tenants, landlords are often willing to provide funding for the build-out. The dollar amount is usually calculated based on the rentable square footage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, landlords are more willing to grant concessions when it is a long-term lease, because they are guaranteed income for a longer length of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with base rents, the market generally dictates lease concessions. But depending on the condition of the space and a tenant’s requirements and credit, these concessions can differ significantly on properties that have similar base rents. It’s important that your real estate broker understands your preferences so that many of these issues can be discussed upfront at or prior to the term-sheet stage and finalized by your attorney in the lease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Renewal options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no automatic lease renewals in commercial real estate. Once your lease expires, there are also no caps on what the landlord can ask for the new rent. Of course, market conditions will influence how strong a position you are in to negotiate. One way to pre-empt this issue is to negotiate for an “option to renew” in your initial lease. Discuss and decide whether this will be a fixed increase or a “fair-market” rent increase, which is calculated by looking at comparable properties and transactions in the neighborhood and may be subject to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Permitted use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that your intended use of the property is permitted by the Certificate of Occupancy (issued by the Department of Buildings) as well as by zoning regulations. The lease needs to state clearly what the permitted uses are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security deposit and guarantees</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Landlords want a reliable tenant. They attempt to ensure this in a number of ways, including via security deposits and guarantees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are deemed somewhat risky, this will be reflected in the amount of security deposit the landlord will require upfront. Security deposits in many cases must be in the form of a letter of credit from your bank, and typically the first month’s rent is due at lease execution, even if there is a free rent period at the beginning of the lease. A corporate guarantee from a parent company that owns the corporate entity signing the lease and/or a “good guy” guaranty provided by a principal of the firm may also be required.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An architect dodged a shady general contractor in the nick of time and ended up with a perfect Sweeten home</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ana and Leo survived the complex process of selling their old apartment and buying a new one simultaneously—no easy feat!—but were nearly taken by an unscrupulous contractor when it came time to renovate. They realized that they needed someone they could trust to facilitate the search for general contractors and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>—a free service matching renovating homeowners with vetted general contractors—</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. (Their words, not ours!) Their Sweeten contractor helped them make layout changes and took on the challenge of creating an oversized sliding door system that allowed the conversion of an open office space into a private guest suite. Here&#8217;s how the couple transformed their Tribeca apartment from an awkward warren of rooms into an open, flexible space that is both comfortable and refined, including redoing the living room, office/guest room, dining space, bedroom, and of course the kitchen and two bathrooms.<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-Portrait.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every real estate agent told us it could not be done. That, in New York, it was nearly impossible to coordinate the sale of our current apartment with the purchase of a new one. But my husband, Leo, was determined, so that is what we set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a long search and many disappointments, including lost bid wars and a contract that fell through, fate brought us an amazing real estate broker who made it all possible. <a href="https://www.kristiambrosetti.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristi Ambrosetti</a> was not fazed by the sell-buy challenge and helped us find our new home and sell our old one.</p>
<p>The apartment met all of our requirements—a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bed, 2-bath in a doorman building in Tribeca, with great light and plenty of storage space. The interior, however, was still in its original condition from the &#8217;80s; it needed a complete renovation to update finishes and fix layout issues that made the space feel choppy and awkward—the exact opposite of the contemporary open space we had hoped for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25151 size-full" title="floor plan" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="647" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER-300x194.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BEFORE-AFTER-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-24996 size-full" title="before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25013 size-full" title="living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg" alt="general contractors" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SWEETEN_Ana_Apartment-24-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>(Above) Living room<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being an architect, I developed the initial plans for the renovation and met with several general contractors that claimed to be available for the job. After <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing multiple bids</a>, we were close to signing with one of them but decided to do some background checking first. I was shocked to find that the address listed in their documents was actually an empty storefront in Queens. The thought that we were very close to making a substantial down payment with someone that might not show up for the job really scared us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, we took the search for general contractors online and came across Sweeten. We read about their screening process to find qualified professionals, and it sounded exactly like what we were looking for, so we decided to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16426&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5YkmLFz4a5xkDfbtxLMvC7WWzQ">post our project</a>. From the beginning, the experience was surprisingly straightforward. Posting on the website was easy and we were soon matched with a few professionals. When we started interviewing potential general contractors, we were contacted by Miranda from Sweeten and she helped us through the whole process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the weeks we had spent interviewing general contractors, we also focused on finalizing the layout and decisions on finishes and fixtures. By the time we signed with our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://app.sweeten.com/members/3380&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1498830122072000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDUErsavPF6GS1QXwyFWAiekS7sA">chosen Sweeten contractor</a>, we were ready to begin demolition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leo and I had been a little apprehensive about some of our design choices, especially when it came to the changes in the layout, which were intended to make the space more open and flexible. But when demolition began, it became clear that we were on the right track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-transformations-floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening up the kitchen</a>, the contractor also eliminated a narrow wall that partially blocked the entryway and made for a very awkward hallway. Squaring off the angled wall between the living room and the master bedroom made both spaces a lot more pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The change that made the most impact, though, was opening the office (which would double as a guest suite) into the living room. Oversized <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/choose-interior-doors-closet-french-doors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding panels</a> would allow the room to be closed off and provide privacy for overnight guests. However, most of the professionals we spoke to thought the panels would be too heavy and could not be done. The Sweeten contracting team accepted the challenge and executed them beautifully.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The one setback we had during demolition was an unexpected electrical conduit found in one of the living room walls we had planned to demolish. The conduit ran down to the apartment below ours and, therefore, could not be moved. After conversations with the contractor, Leo and I decided to take down the rest of the wall as originally planned and leave only the section that had the conduit, creating a corner niche that was perfect for a bookshelf. Once the renovation was complete, this turned out to be one of our favorite features in the apartment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect that had drawn us to the apartment was a nook next to the living room that seemed perfect for a small bar. Early in the project, we pulled inspiration photos online and it seemed like designing the bar would be fairly easy. That was until we decided the bar should also house a concealed 40-inch TV, which then led to weeks of research and multiple drawing iterations until we landed on a design that met all of our functional requirements for both the bar and the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining room pendants were another big challenge. The position of the existing light did not align with the center of the dining table, and we were not able to move the light because of the concrete ceiling. I had almost given up on having pendants over the table when Leo came across the Swell String fixture, which allowed for the pendants to be installed in any position, independent of the canopy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The finishes for the bathrooms and kitchen were also much debated. We knew from the beginning we wanted <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/natural-stone-boosts-luxe-factor-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marble tile</a> in the bathrooms but looked at a wide range of patterns, sizes, and prices. Narrowing down the search to neutral tones and classic patterns, I eventually chose an Asian statuary from TileBar for the master bathroom and a Bardiglio herringbone mosaic for the guest bathroom floor, with the same Asian statuary in the shower. As a contrast to the traditional tile, I selected modern Duravit fixtures and Grohe faucets. The towel warmers had been at the top of our wishlist and after much research, we were able to find a small hardwired option that worked well in both bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For our small <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/galley-kitchen-rule-small-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">galley kitchen</a>, we chose the same low-maintenance quartz countertops we had in our previous apartment, paired with white <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinets</a> and integrated Bosch appliances. The cabinets were finished with black linear pulls with accent walnut shelves added on the back wall for some extra storage. The backsplash was probably one of the toughest decisions—with so many interesting materials and patterns to choose from, we considered all sorts of options, from large back-painted glass panels to intricate mosaics. As a way to balance the modern cabinets and countertops, we decided on marble subway tile from TileBar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our main goals for the master bedroom were to <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximize storage</a> and improve circulation. So the swing bedroom door was replaced with a pocket door, improving access to a long wall of closets that ended in a small custom-made vanity at the corner of the room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Leo and I found that all the time spent obsessing over the small details really paid off—it all came together as we had hoped and we were very happy, not only with our choices but with the quality of execution and expertise the Sweeten contractor and his team brought to the project. Most importantly, knowing Sweeten was following the project, and touching base with us periodically gave us peace of mind through the whole process.</span></p>
