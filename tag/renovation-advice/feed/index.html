<h3>Jean: When should you include a designer in your home renovation project?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Bring an interior designer on board as soon as you know you want design services for a home renovation project. Do that immediately after you&#8217;ve sat down and identified your scope of work. You will want the designer to understand what your goals are.</p>
<p>Hash through those design elements very early on so your designer can help convey that design intent to your contractor. That&#8217;s what really starts the language to make certain your contractor understands your needs and the budget implications of your overall design goal. Your <a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/interior-designers/a33434747/why-hiring-an-interior-designer-is-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designer and your contractor will work in tandem</a> to achieve those goals. They will mitigate any construction problems which may arise, particularly if you&#8217;re working in an older home.</p>
<h3>Jean: Where do you start with a designer? How do you know what style you want?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Most clients don&#8217;t really have a real definition of particular styles. If you ask them, ‘What&#8217;s your design style?’, they don&#8217;t necessarily know that. Folks will often say, ‘Here&#8217;s a Pinterest board’ and try to develop a mood from that because they can&#8217;t really identify the styles.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s contemporary, what&#8217;s Baroque, what&#8217;s Art Deco, what&#8217;s classical. But they can look at something—an image—and that visual exactly identifies how they feel. Do they feel relaxed? Do they feel comfortable? Do they feel like they&#8217;ve been transported to another country? Do they like exotic elements or bohemian elements? How those items make them feel is really the storybook for what you want to tell.</p>
<h3>Jean: How do you budget a designer?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Designers charge either <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/how-much-does-an-interior-designer-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flat fees or project fees</a>. If you&#8217;re not really certain about whether you can splurge on a big project and have your designer see the project all the way through, you might just hire a designer to essentially do a concept fee. That designer will then sit down with you, identify your scope of work, and try to pull in elements and materials that you like. Identify the wood finishes. Do you want porcelain floors, tile, floors, marble floors? What kind of tile do you want? Do you want simple, basic subway tiles? Do you want a really elaborate laser-cut fancy tile?</p>
<p>Once you decide these things, go to any Home Depot or materials tile store. I recommend bringing samples to your initial consultation or first meeting with your designer. Showing ‘the kinds of things I like’ will start to identify early on where your budget&#8217;s going to go. As you&#8217;re developing your scope of work, you&#8217;re identifying for that person what the overall budget is going to be. The designer can help identify how many hours they will need to spend on the project. This will ultimately determine the designer&#8217;s fee, and how much time they need to commit to the project to see it through.</p>
<p>Again, if you don&#8217;t have a big budget for a designer, which is going to start likely at $5,000 for a concept fee or similar, at least you get enough to share with a contractor.</p>
<h3>Jean: Is the black matte finish trendy?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I absolutely think it&#8217;s going to be trendy. I particularly recommend staying away from trends. If you anticipate being in your home for 30 years, in five years, you&#8217;re going to want to rip that black hardware out.</p>
<p>I suggest you stay within the realm of the nickels. Patina brass or unlacquered brass will take on a lovely patina over time and is one of my favorites. Yellow and white metals have longevity. They&#8217;ve been around hundreds of years and <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/decorating-with-gold-accents-adds-glamour-to-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they work within any environment</a> whether it’s contemporary, ultramodern, or traditional.</p>

<h3>Jean: What do you think about the subway tile trend? How do you personalize it?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I’m seeing a lot of subway tiles everywhere. I think at one point, everyone&#8217;s going to just start saying, &#8216;I&#8217;m ripping out all these baths with all this subway tile, because it&#8217;s just everywhere.&#8217; It&#8217;s sort of over-saturating all of the imagery right now. And I understand it. It&#8217;s a nice clean look. It&#8217;s extremely affordable. So your money goes a long way. But if you&#8217;re going to do the subway tile, instead of it all being white, I suggest you integrate some sort of graphic pattern and change the directions of the tile.</p>
<h3>Jean: What is the best flooring for kitchens and bathrooms?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I am really a lover of porcelain tiles. Extremely durable, easy to clean, maintenance-free. Porcelain tile has many different textures now. I don&#8217;t recommend real wood in a kitchen, but there are many beautiful porcelain tiles that have graining to them. They have nice color ranges that really look like wood. I think they&#8217;re fantastic.</p>
<p>I never use polished marble in bathrooms due to the slip hazard. When they get wet, you can break your neck. So stick to matte finishes, you&#8217;ll save your life.</p>

<h3>Jean: What do you think about Ikea kitchens?</h3>
<p><strong>Joy:</strong> I&#8217;ve seen some lovely kitchen&#8217;s done with Ikea cabinetry. When it&#8217;s done with beautiful stone tops and Ikea cabinets, I think it&#8217;s beautiful. I enjoy seeing glass inserts in the uppers, I&#8217;ve actually done this on a project.</p>

<p>There are so many things to consider when planning a renovation. You need to think about scope and budget, materials and finishes, and so much more. Making over even a small space in your home is a big deal! Whether you&#8217;re transforming a bathroom or a whole house, there are scores of items to keep track of and decisions to make. Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> homeowners share what they learned after going through the renovation process, and give their top home renovation tips.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Little renovation changes can make a big impact</h3>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating your space doesn&#8217;t have to mean major construction. You can easily make a difference through small changes. Take, for example, AC; who turned to a Sweeten contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/a-duplex-loft-elevates-to-a-charming-rental/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help renovate his loft</a>. He did have some extensive work done, like electrical updates, adding office space, and enclosing a loft.  But he also made smaller changes. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nstead of replacing the kitchen cabinets, AC had them refinished in a rich, more modern blue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also brought his stair railing up-to-date with a new coat of paint. To modernize the bathroom, he changed the color of the walls from white to gray.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC’s advice to those thinking of renovation? “Just to be realistic,” he says. “With little changes, you can make a big impact.”</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Work with design professionals, if you can</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiring an interior designer</a> is a nice perk if you can fit it in your budget. They provide a keen eye for design and convenience that many renovators find extremely helpful. &#8220;I highly recommend working with a design professional,&#8221; says Matthew Stewart, who recently worked with a Sweeten contractor to <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/renovation-materials-shine-in-designers-full-home-reno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovate his own condo in Brooklyn</a>. &#8220;It’s easy to underestimate the amount of work involved.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also recommends not getting too hung up on specific choices. &#8220;Sometimes it’s easier to just pick something nice that you know you like, and move on,&#8221; he says. And interior designers make that easy, narrowing it down to just a few options that fit your style and project. </span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Budget Wisely: Nice-to-Haves vs. Must-Haves</h3>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting—and sticking to—your budget is important. Sometimes it is easier said than done. &#8220;When you’re renovating, plan that it will take more time and money than you plan for,&#8221; says Sweeten renovator Claire. &#8220;There are always surprise things that happen as you go through the process.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she <a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/studio-grows-into-junior-one-bedroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">converted her studio</a> into a junior one-bedroom, she &#8220;ended up spending roughly 25% more than the original budget.&#8221; That was due to added change orders to address issues that came up. Her advice is to decide your renovation <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-plan-your-renovation-and-find-the-best-general-contractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”</a> and stick with them.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Know what you need in a contractor—and for your renovation</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeowner/contractor partnership is like any relationship—you need to communicate for it to work. And part of that is knowing what you want, what you expect from the other person, and vice versa. For<a href="https://sweeten.com/nyc/odd-shaped-kitchen-co-op-refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ryan and Sophie</a>, finding the right contractor was vital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had spent ten years saving up to renovate their one-bedroom, so they wanted it done right.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The contractor was really good at keeping me in the loop and letting me know what was happening and when,&#8221; says Ryan. &#8220;Managing and communicating expectations is a big part of a successful partnership.&#8221; He also suggests having &#8220;a plan so you’ll have a better idea of where to compromise with your decisions and where not to.”</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-45033 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/VideoVisti-CHOSEN-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With COVID-19 quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, it can be difficult to move ahead with home improvement and building projects. Social distancing practices are vital to everyone’s health and safety. Many states and cities have halted all construction they consider non-essential. Luckily, there is an important virtual solution to help homeowners renovate safely during COVID-19. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">At Sweeten, we’ve worked with our community of contractors to create the following guidelines for conducting virtual site visits. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> </span><span class="s1">matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free.. </span><span class="s2">We’re in the business of taking the complication and uncertainty out of the renovation process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What is a virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Homeowners preparing for a renovation or new construction must meet with a general contractor for a thorough review of the property. Traditionally, the general contractor looks at the property in-person to understand the existing site conditions, take measurements, review documents, and discuss the project with the homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A virtual site visit is the same process, conducted by video call. This allows for both parties to safely review the renovation project virtually, without meeting in person. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit gives the contractor the same visual information as an in-person visit. It also has similar limitations; don’t expect to resolve everything in one visit. Lingering questions can always be resolved during a later visit, over video, or in-person. </span>Do note that contractors&#8217; estimates will be considered “commercially reasonable” but not ironclad. A physical site visit will need to be done at some point to make their own measurements and account for every detail.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A streaming video conference replaces both the general contractor’s walk-through of the property and the face-to-face conference between contractor and homeowner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If done effectively, a virtual site visit usually gives the contractor enough information to begin drawing up an estimate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“</span><span class="s1">I truly believe a virtual site meeting for most projects will be enough to send an estimate for the labor cost,” says Long Island-based <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/6806#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten general contractor Robi</a>. “The one item that is held up is the material selection process.” However, if you’ve hired a design-build firm that is assisting you with design and materials, “then even the design process can be done virtually in order to get the price of material selections.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">One important limitation: an estimate based on the virtual site visit will be considered “best-effort” or “commercially reasonable.” It may require adjustments after the contractor makes their own measurements. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">How do I prepare for a virtual site visit? </span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Think of it more as a formal interview than as a chat with friends or family. It’s important to be well prepared. Make sure you’ve organized your brief and any supplementary papers, your measurements, and your questions and talking points (see “</span><span class="s1">Post your project + p</span><span class="s1">repare background information</span><span class="s1">,” below). </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 1: Prepare your video technology</span></h4>
<h5 class="p6"><strong><span class="s1">The Sweeten Video tool:</span></strong></h5>
<ul class="ul1">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">Sweeten&#8217;s in-platform video tool for virtual site visits makes it easy and organized to work with a potential general contractor. It will run on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. No outside video apps or other downloads will be necessary. Save time on working out Android/iPhone compatibility issues. </span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s3">All parties will receive a link to the video meeting in an email.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you can, try testing it with a friend or family member. Make sure your signal is strong enough to let you chat while walking through the worksite. This will all cut down on time spent fiddling with technology during the virtual visit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your video camera cannot be anchored to a desktop computer or laptop. Phones and tablets are the best tools for walk-throughs.</span></p>
<p><span class="s6">Agree on a backup plan, in case your video quality breaks down during the call. Will you move to a regular phone call? Or, if you think you can resolve the connection problems, will you reschedule a video call?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you choose to use a third-party app, you and the general contractor must use the same video chat app. If one or both parties use an Android, you won’t be able to use Facetime. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 2: Post your project + p</span><span class="s1">repare background information</span></h4>
<p>The Sweeten contractors you meet with will need <span class="s1">background information and a thorough project description to supplement the visuals. <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post your project</a> on Sweeten where the contractors can review this information before the video call. </span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what to include in your project post:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A clear description of all work you would like done<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Length, depth, and height measurements of each room being worked on<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">A simple floor plan. This is optional and can be obtained from a property closing or an online realtor site like StreetEasy.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Age of the property<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Prior renovation work<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Homeowners association covenants applicable to the project<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Entry access such as stairs or elevator<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Parking availability<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Take photos: </span><span class="s1">Prepare three or four well-lit still photos of the project area that convey a sense of scale. </span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 2a: One-page briefs</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">If you are not in our service area, the local contractors you meet will still need this information. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Create a one-page brief that includes the bullet points above, including the still photos. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To prevent information overload, keep the brief truly brief—ideally, keep it to one page. E-mail the brief and the photos to the general contractor at least a few days before your virtual site visit. Keep your copies with you during the visit, for reference.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Step 3: Prepare your talking points</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Site visits typically begin with a walkthrough, followed by a sit-down discussion of the project. These typically last between 60—90 minutes on average. Prepare a list of topics that you would like to discuss. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Important points to cover:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li2"><span class="s5">Whether particular spaces </span><span class="s1">will or will not be available for a certain amount of time</span><span class="s5"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">What materials and fixtures will be recycled and reused<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li2"><span class="s1">How the non-remodel parts of the house will be protected during the renovation<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p6"><span class="s1">Step 4: Prepare your house</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As with an in-person site visit, you need to prepare the area before the virtual walkthrough.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Remove any clutter and any furniture that could block important views<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Maximize the light by uncovering all windows and turning on the lights<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Prepare to close off the area from wandering pets or children<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tip: you can make your virtual walkthrough more productive by conducting a practice run with a friend. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What can I expect during my virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit usually has three phases: introduction, walkthrough, and a sit-down conference.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Introductions</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is your opportunity for a casual hello, and a stand-in for a handshake. You get to see each other’s faces. You may also want to discuss what time you’ll end the call.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Virtual renovation site walkthrough</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Let your contractor play an active role. As you move through the space, make sure you’re showing them what they need to see. They may ask you to double back or move in closer to something, and may ask you to pause at certain points so they can take screenshots. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Unless the general contractor requests otherwise, walk through the space in this order, always moving the camera slowly:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Establish the general environment directly beyond the intended work area. If this is a bathroom remodel, for example, show the rooms and the hallways just outside the bathroom.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Move into the work area through its main entrance.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">In the work area itself, stand at the center and turn the camera slowly, 360-degrees.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Standing at various points along the perimeter, pan the camera slowly across the space.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Move the camera from the ceiling to the floor.<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Highlight key sections. In the bathroom remodel example, the shower or bathtub would be a section to highlight. Direct the contractor’s attention with a “show-and-tell” technique; hold the phone in one hand and point with the other. Make sure you can see your pointing hand on your own screen, and that it’s clear what you’re pointing to. <img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-44885 mt-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha.jpg" alt="virtual renovation site visit in bathroom" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bathroom-Point_Tisha-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Show a few close-ups. For example, <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/remodeling-a-bathroom-six-trends-to-consider-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a bathroom renovation</a>, show a close-up view of the shower walls, open up the vanity doors to show the valves under the sink, and show where the toilet valve is located.</span></li>
<li class="li4"><span class="s1">As long as you can maintain a video signal, move to the outermost part of your property such as the exterior door, sidewalk, driveway, and street to give the contractor a sense of access. The contractor doesn’t need to see your face as you’re walking through the home. They just need to see the space.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">Sit-down conference</span></h4>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Move to a table or desk. Turn the camera back around to your face. Discuss the walkthrough, the contractor’s questions, and the talking points that you prepared earlier.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">What comes after my virtual site visit?</span></h3>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">E-mail your contractor. After the formalities of thanking the contractor for the visit, document in writing your common understandings of the project, particularly anything not covered in the brief.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">First, clarify the project’s status. Do you want the project to move ahead, which means asking the contractor to submit an estimate? If so, state this clearly. Confirm with the contractor whether they are able to submit an estimate for your review.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Your contractor may come up with more questions while preparing the estimate, known in the industry as “Requests For Information.” Your email establishes a clear channel for these requests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1" style="color: #333333;">Be aware that your contractor’s estimate will be considered “commercially reasonable” but not ironclad. Contractors will not be able to account for every detail before they’ve done a physical site visit and made their own measurements.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When you’ve received estimates from all the contractors you’ve approached, it will be time to make your choice. Sweeten can help by “<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/"><span class="s7">bid leveling</span></a>,” which means translating all the estimates into equivalent terms so they can be directly compared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">A virtual site visit is a powerful tool for renovating safely during COVID-19. It will let you take important steps on your renovation, including booking a contractor, all while sheltering-in-place. When restrictions lift and the economy recovers, your preferred contractors will be much harder to book. We hope these guidelines will help you get a head start, and help you complete your renovation as quickly and safely as possible.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><b>Sweeten renovators share what they wish they&#8217;d known: Having a backup living plan during construction, preparing to order materials, and more </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how much you prepare for a renovation, you can’t be ready for every unexpected issue that arises. With the right general contractor as your partner, you’ll have help in navigating the process and handling roadblocks. Take it from these Sweeten renovators, who all went through a renovation and came out with a home, sweet, home. Along the way, they learned invaluable lessons about home renovation: see their advice below. </span></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Do the renovation all at once (if you can)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" title="happy-couple-black-floor-lamp"  data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-20.jpg" alt="Happy couple near a black floor lamp" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48626" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Jeremy-Kitchen_Bath-20-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jeremy and Chris’ renovation of their kitchen, bathroom, and foyer was all said and done, </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/hudson-yards-co-op-charm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they learned one major lesson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: complete every room or space all at once. Jeremy explained that for him, it wasn’t about the disruption or costs, but about the final product. “Few of us really have the talent to create a cohesive space in small increments,” he said. Their bedroom had become a storage spot for their furniture during the remodel and wasn’t part of the renovation scope.</span></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Material selection can be more stressful than you’d think</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-37981 size-full" title="open kitchen and living room" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02.jpg" alt="Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, renovation, living room, kitchen" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SWEETEN-Rashida-Abuwala-Apt-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having planned a renovation (and making the design decisions) previously, one Sweeten renovator realized just how much work it takes to select all the materials. She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/clinton-hill-experienced-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated multiple spaces in her home</a>—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including the kitchen and bathroom. Not only was she selecting the finishes, but she also had to make sure she ordered enough of them, plus coordinate delivery and timing. “If you can hire a designer whose aesthetic you trust to select all the materials for you, do it!” </span></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Create two budgets (to prepare for surprises!)</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38265 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901.jpg" alt="Park Slope, Brooklyn, renovation, portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MG_5901-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">From replacing the floors (and discovering a lack of subfloor) to gutting their bathroom, Katie and Marcus</span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/replacing-wood-floors-park-slope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faced their share of surprises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during their renovation. Her main takeaway? Budget. The </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/category/renovation-101/cost-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten cost guides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped them get an idea of what they’d spend, though in retrospect Katie shared it would&#8217;ve been great given their unexpected circumstances to create two: an “on paper this is what we want to spend” budget and a “we cannot afford to go over this number” budget.</span></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Book your back-up living situation for extra time from the get-go</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36106 size-full" title="family portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01.jpg" alt="Rattenbury family portrait, home, renovation, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Courtney-Rattenbury-Apt-01-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We always encourage renovators to </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/stay-or-go-home-renovation-pros-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move out of their homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a remodel if they can. Courtney and Jim planned ahead and rented an apartment for their family of four during the </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/family-renovation-clinton-hill-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovation of their entire apartment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The schedule fell a bit behind due to delivery delays. Subsequently, they had to leave their rental and move back into their unfinished home. “It was a bit uncomfortable, but not unmanageable. In hindsight, we probably should have just booked the rental for an extra week as insurance,” Courtney said.</span></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: If you’re short on time, hire an architect</h3>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34636 size-full" title="portrait" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynn and Craig, who struggled to find a general contractor before coming to Sweeten, realize how much </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their project would’ve benefited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from hiring an architect. Lynn has a background in exhibit design, which helped in planning the bathroom remodels and wall removal in the home. From a time-management perspective, however, they realized a renovation is basically a second job. “We now understand why people hire architects. If you have less design experience or a tight timeline, try to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Get the lowdown on their projects and advice</h2>
<p>No matter the level of experience, the key to tackling a renovation is being prepared for the expected—and the unexpected. When renovators, beginners and pros alike, come to Sweeten, they get the guarantee of a licensed contractor specifically matched to their project, plus the support of an entire company whose number one priority is making sure the project goes right. These first-timers shared their reno journeys—and what they learned along the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38247 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovators" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Sheilaja-Rao-Apt-12-v2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>The biggest components of Sheilaja and Sergio’s renovation revolved around entertaining. They wanted to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/creating-dining-area-windsor-terrace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize their tight galley kitchen</a> and reimagine the foyer as a dining area. In the cook space, they decided to extend the cabinetry for more storage and chose a glossy white finish that reflects light. Instead of running upper cabinets along both sides, the couple opted for floating shelves, making the space feel wider and longer. To create a dining room, they removed two closets in the foyer, allowing enough space for bookshelves and a full table and chairs. “As first-time renovators, we greatly appreciated how responsive our Sweeten contractor was to our calls and emails throughout the renovation. In the few instances where something needed to be adjusted or redone, he was willing to take the extra steps to make sure we were satisfied with the outcome,” Sheilaja shared.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35193 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovators" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-723x482.jpg" alt="portrait " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-JenniferLee-Apt-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>Jen bought her first apartment eager to renovate the kitchen, but decided to live with it to get a feel for how she’d actually use the space.“I had a pretty clear vision of the aesthetics and giving myself that extra year solidified those design decisions,” she said. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/scandinavian-kitchen-renovation-crown-heights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she got started on the renovation</a>, a wall came down between the living area and kitchen. She connected the separate spaces with a peninsula for more counter space and a built-in spot to eat. The rest of the minimalistic cook space came together with sleek cabinets, barely-there hardware, and integrated appliances. She loved the transformation so much, choosing a favorite element was nearly impossible, though she did have a few words of wisdom for future renovators. For one, start putting together a materials list before you even hire a contractor. Jen assembled a spreadsheet with everything from appliances to light fixtures to keep track of things she loved and to see if they went on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-36159 mb-0 size-chrono" title="racquel-standing-in-her-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg" alt="racquel standing in her kitchen near window after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SWEETEN-Racquel-Goodison-Kitchen-10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>After mishaps with a kitchen designer and a year off from the process, Racquel began her kitchen renovation with a Sweeten general contractor by her side. Though there were a few issues with deliveries and delays, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/kensington-brooklyn-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project was complete</a> within the three-week window her contractor had quoted. Including the time spent before she found Sweeten, Racquel did put more time into the renovation than expected. Her patience and perseverance proved worth it. “Resist the urge to rip things out before you have a chance to live with it. If I hadn’t, I don’t think I would’ve made the best decisions,” she said. “Sometimes I walk into the kitchen with the sun coming in and it feels like a postcard. It looks like a magazine.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34636 size-chrono" title="first-time renovator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Lynn-Wen-Kiang-Apt-20-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></p>
<p>Lynn and Craig’s number one request for an apartment? An in-unit washer and dryer. They found a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half bathroom in a perfect location, with great bones, but no laundry. Ultimately they decided to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/desperately-seeking-a-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tackle both of the apartment’s bathrooms</a>. Their contractor found a spot in their 24-square-foot half bathroom to install a laundry area by tapping into the sink’s water line. To solve another problem in the space, a lingering smell of cat urine, the walls and floor were gutted and rebuilt. While Lynn’s background in exhibit design allowed them to renovate without an architect, in retrospect they would’ve hired one. “Renovating a home is practically a second job if you undertake it on your own with just a contractor. We now understand why people hire architects. For those with less design experience or who are strapped for time, it would be helpful to work with a professional who can do the groundwork for you,” Craig said.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35896 mb-0 size-chrono" title="first-time renovator" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-723x482.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sonali-Rana-Apt-21.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>After losing out on several homes, Sonali and Shalaj were surprised when their bid on a two-bedroom co-op in the Financial District of Manhattan was accepted. Once reality hit, the new homeowners came to a conclusion: they had to <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/financial-district-couple-apartment-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut renovate the ‘70s style apartment</a>. In addition to reimagining the bathroom and bedroom, they decided the living area should be an open concept. Most of their budget and effort went into updating the kitchen, including appliances and materials. Fortunately, a friend advised them to set aside a 30% buffer on top of their budget. “The advice came in handy as that was almost exactly the amount we went over by. Extra costs included a few items outside the original scope such as replacing the AC unit and also spending more on kitchen materials than had been initially planned,” Sonali said.</p>

<div>
<p><em>Welcome to #16 in our series, designed to bring clarity to some of the mysteries of renovating! Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or a serial renovator, each project brings with it a new set of circumstances and new questions, and Sweeten is here to be a source of knowledge and reassurance. </em></p>

</div>
<div><strong>QUESTION: What&#8217;s the biggest myth about general contractors?</strong></div>
<div><strong>JEAN: </strong>I love this question! One of the biggest myths about general contractors is that they want projects to go on for a long time. We&#8217;ve heard homeowners say things like, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s trying to stretch out the project. He wants it to, you know, go on forever.&#8221; The truth is, general contractors want exactly the opposite. Each day they have workers on your project is another day that they have to incur labor costs. Their ideal project is one that <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/how-long-does-an-apartment-reno-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts and ends exactly on the schedule</a> they laid out so they can take that crew and move them to another project. General contractors do not want your project to go on indefinitely. They want it to be done as quickly as possible—just like you do—and they want to do it well.</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how well you prepare, renovating your home can still seem like a daunting task. The unexpected tends to happen when you least expect it, so take advantage of the hard-won knowledge gleaned by our Sweeten homeowners. We asked them to share their advice for future renovators, listed below. Whether you are planning your first project or are an experienced renovator, these home remodeling tips will help guide you on the path to a successful renovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33305 size-chrono" title="apartment renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Sophie-Delios-Walls01-723x482.gif" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Find pictures of rooms with your planned paint color</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracking down real-life examples of paint colors used within rooms <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-condo-divides-and-conquers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabled Sophie to nail down</a> the palette for her renovation. Seeing paint samples in person and within 3-D renderings was helpful, but there&#8217;s more to it. &#8220;You’re not really sure how it feels until you actually see the space in person,” she said. As a solution, Sophie found photos of rooms online that were painted in the same shades she had selected. &#8220;We ended up picking up all the inspiration books and samples we could find at the hardware store; then I’d compare all the colors to pictures on Pinterest, going back and forth on nearly identical shades.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Don&#8217;t forget the small details while planning ahead</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planning ahead is crucial, and it&#8217;s something that many homeowners post-renovation will emphatically recommend to future renovators. &#8220;It’s better to have all your ideas on paper before you begin, from important aspects like flooring and appliances to the small details that are easy to overlook, such as cabinet hardware, paint colors, lighting fixtures, and electrical outlets. Having this mapped out will make your life and your contractor’s life much easier during the renovation,&#8221; Heather and Eric said, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/with-this-reno-i-thee-wed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following their apartment remodel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32171 size-chrono" title="white-pillar-dining-table" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg" alt="white pillar near dining table with chandelier in ceiling and brick wall after renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10-585x878.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SWEETEN-RachelKronman10.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: See your finishes— counters, molding, and more—in person</h3>
<p>After <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-duplex-renovated-for-a-new-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redoing her living room</a> and bringing the dining area into the kitchen, Rachel said she now understands how important it is to see finishes in person before making any decisions. &#8220;It’s really difficult to imagine what crown molding, counters, or other elements look like (in real-life) on a computer screen.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-31376 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SWEETEN-Sari-Resnick-Bathroom03-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Estimate how fixtures will fit into rooms—and how you&#8217;ll use them</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you&#8217;re thinking about the big picture, don&#8217;t let the smaller details slip through the cracks. Once <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/desperately-seeking-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sari renovated her bathroom</a>, she shared a few tips for a successful remodel: &#8220;Make note of where your towel bars are and where they should be so that they are at a comfortable height. Also, check which side of the toilet you want your flusher on, because you can’t change that.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33697 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SWEETEN-ZoeChen-Apt-20-723x1085.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Use your belongings to make more accurate measurements</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/the-genius-of-an-apartment-combination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combining her apartment</a> with the one next door, Zoe noted that ironing out the details, like knowing how big the closets and drawers should be, will keep your project moving along smoothly. “Measure everything and live the design in your head. Know how many linear feet of closet you need and where you might store the vacuum cleaner. This is especially helpful for the kitchen design.” She also measured the maximum size of her pots so she could find drawers that were the right height.</p>

</a>Homeowners <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha and Adam</a> with their two daughters</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say the best way to learn is by experience. After that, the second-best way to learn is by talking to people who have been in your shoes. Sweeten homeowners emerge from the renovation process with more than a few &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments and generously share their hard-won renovation advice with our readers on the blog. We’ve gathered some of their most meaningful advice below. Wherever you are in your renovation journey, we hope this insight will help as you create your very own home sweet home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29012 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Casey-McIntyre-Kitchen_Bathroom05-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 1: Measure around your belongings for the most accurate spacing</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The original cabinets in <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-work-triangle-sets-off-a-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this homeowner’s kitchen</a> were too shallow; in fact, closing the cabinet doors had chipped most of her plates. When it came time to renovate, deeper cabinets were a must. If you’re planning a kitchen renovation, this homeowner shares the following advice: “Measure all your cookware and then use those measurements to design your kitchen cabinets. It made us feel a little OCD to do this, but it really paid off.” Even if you plan on buying stock cabinets vs. custom-made, measuring the interiors to make sure that all of your cookware will fit is a smart move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30430 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_NateMichelle-Bathrooms08-new-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 2: Short on time? Order materials as early as possible.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to make a tight timeline work, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-moody-bath-for-a-getaway-home-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nate and Michelle</a> recommend that future renovators order materials as soon as possible. “Make sure you have all the pieces before starting. That includes the tile, fixtures, vanities, toilets, and even the little things like towel hooks and toilet paper holders. That way, you can avoid delays while waiting for some piece to come in,” Nate said. Purchasing stock items versus custom or special order will make it easier to stay on schedule. At Sweeten, we see homeowners placing orders for materials without consulting with their contractor on the timeline, which can cause major project delays, so this is sage advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29713 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SWEETEN-BrookePaulJones-Apt01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 3: Prepare for paint hues to look different on your walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major lessons that <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/1920s-westchester-home-gets-a-modern-makeover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke</a> learned while renovating is that paint colors never look the way you expect them to look once they’re on the walls of your home. “I had eight swatches of gray and greige paint on the [kitchen] walls for weeks and finally decided on Wickham Gray from Benjamin Moore. The day the contractor was painting the kitchen, I was working from home. I came downstairs to see a neighbor, and she immediately said, ‘I didn’t know you were going green in the kitchen.’ So we turned around and went with Gray Owl [another Benjamin Moore paint] instead,” Brooke said. The takeaway: if there’s a tint, or a hint of another color, visible from the paint swatch, expect it to have a much bigger effect on your space when your walls are painted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-29899 size-chrono" title="bedroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Marsha_and_Adam_Townhouse-22.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 4: Soundproofing can be worth the expense for privacy and comfort</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soundproofing is rarely noticeable—it’s essentially invisible—but the role it plays can have an enormous impact on your daily life. “Paying more for soundproofing the bathroom (so you don’t hear anything from your bedroom) is worth every penny,” <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-sunnier-re-do-for-a-brooklyn-townhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha</a> said. “We really appreciated our Sweeten architect telling us that we ‘needed’ those more expensive items—she was right.” Of course, you don’t have to soundproof your bathroom, but if you can fit it into your budget, this extra step elevates the comfort of your home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-28698 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg" alt="renovation advice" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SWEETEN_Sarah-Graves-Kitchen_Bath_Nursery_ForBlog01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>Renovation Tip 5: Conserve funds in parts of your budget to help pay for unexpected issues</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sticking to your budget can be difficult, especially when quality is your top priority. However, doing so pays off when something unexpected happens—like discovering that you need more materials than you budgeted for. When considering brands of non-toxic paint, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/original-details-brooklyn-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah</a> looked at high-end options first before choosing a budget-friendly brand. The economically priced VOC-free paint turned out to be a smart decision. “Our plaster walls drank up the paint and we ended up having to buy 25 gallons when we originally budgeted for ten,” said Sarah. Since she chose an affordable option from the get-go, the extra gallons of paint didn’t break the budget.</p>
