<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Written in partnership with homeowners Danielle and Michelle</span></em></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remodeling a converted condo in Hoboken, New Jersey</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We purchased our home in June 2020, a 1,100-square-foot condominium in a former 1800s schoolhouse. The downtown Hoboken, NJ building was converted into condos 30 years ago, and we love its character—our apartment has 24-foot ceilings with original wood beams.</span></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg" alt="Galley kitchen with bar seating and black cabinets" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52149" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-02-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are Danielle, an attorney, and Michelle, a human resources manager, and our plan was to move here with our two cats, Sylvia and Eleanor. We knew going into the purchase that we would renovate the kitchen and bath. Both needed a facelift. We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/67197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our project on Sweeten</a>, with accurate specs, and soon got responses from contractors interested in working with us. It wasn’t long before we found <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/5676#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a contractor we felt was a great fit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our goals for the renovation were easy to convey, since the existing rooms’ shortcomings were obvious. The kitchen was closed off from the rest of the living area and outdated—we wanted to open it up and connect it to the living area. It was not only badly designed, but in poor condition, too. The cabinets were falling apart; we had to lift one of the doors with a foot to open or close the dishwasher. The bathroom was also in bad shape, with cracked tiles and water damage.</span></p>
<h3>A black kitchen, bold yet neutral</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wanted our remodel to be clean, modern, and simple, but still a statement. In 5 to 10 years, it should still look updated. We chose black cabinets and other features because they would stand out and look timeless. Neutral tones would complement decorative accents, and we like the clean feeling of white surfaces. We also wanted natural elements that would tie to the condo’s existing wood floors and warm up the space. We felt the palette would come together to create a modern, edgy vibe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg" alt="View of the renovated galley kitchen with open shelving and globe lights" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52151" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-04-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg" alt="Renovated kitchen with beige tile, black cabinets, and white marble counter" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52150" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-03-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our objectives in the kitchen included opening the room, increasing storage, and tailoring the cabinets and drawers to our specific needs. Seating would be added to the design to keep the cook company during dinner prep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In planning the layout, the inclusion of base <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/semihandmade-cabinets-up-the-ante-without-the-pricetag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets with drawers to maximize storage</a> was important to us. We wanted, too, to add a pantry, which the kitchen did not previously have; we managed to fit it in just right of the fridge. We were excited to find matte black cabinets—they look expensive but were more affordable than traditional cabinets, and almost as customizable. Plus, they’re made from recycled plastic! The wooden floating shelves add not only a natural touch but easy-access storage for dishes and glasses.</span></p>
<h3>Creating a home baker&#8217;s kitchen</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The plan also included new appliances and we decided to splurge on a high-end package. Danielle is an avid baker and successfully jumped on the sourdough bandwagon when the pandemic began—she loves being able to preheat the oven from her phone. We were set on a full-size fridge with an ice maker. We also fit in the world’s smallest wine refrigerator, at about six inches wide. We don’t drink much but love to have a few cold bottles on hand—this fridge holds seven.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg" alt="Black cabinets, stainless steel appliances, white marble counters, natural wood shelving" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52153" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-06-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Wallpaper and black paint for a bathroom</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bathroom, we wanted to go simple and coordinate with the kitchen. We wanted the space to feel connected, and to that end, we kept to a similar neutral color scheme and same tile shapes. We installed a glass shower, knowing that the transparent walls would make this space feel bigger. In any case, we already have a tub upstairs. We <a href="https://sweeten.com/advice-and-faq/why-wallpaper-is-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went with a statement wallpaper</a>. We thought it made sense to go playful in the small bathroom. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span>
</p></blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg" alt="Bathroom with walk-in shower, vanity, and large mirror" width="1000" height="1499" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52156" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-09-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Managing during the home remodel</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As first-time renovators, we were unsure about the timing of various phases and what the overall costs would be. We talked about when the materials, which we sourced on our own, needed to come. During the renovation, w</span><span class="s1">e retreated to Danielle’s parents’ home in Arizona. The condo is an open loft and isn’t conducive to phone calls—we didn’t think it would be possible to live, work, and renovate from home.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">What we did participate in was shopping for all of our materials, creating our vision and the end result!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was hard not being able to see the project’s daily progress, and to step back from our inclinations to micro-manage. But we did. We communicated our choices and concerns to our Sweeten contractor, from afar, usually over texts or on phone calls. Our contractor was patient and sent pictures as progress updates. Along the way, we learned the importance of communicating—ask questions and tell your contractor what you want, as you are your best advocate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg" alt="Bathroom with black and white walls and vanity" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52154" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-07-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg" alt="Bathroom with glass shower door and black matte hardware" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52155" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/67197-Michelle-KitchBath-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since we had a great relationship with our contractor, and we made all of the budgetary and design decisions, we didn’t end up needing to use some services Sweeten had to offer. Still, we were grateful for the match with a contractor we knew was vetted. We felt peaceful knowing that Sweeten had our back if an issue were to arise.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Tips on staying on budget</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we had one piece of advice to share, it would be about the budget. Figure out what your limit is—the one that you can actually afford. From there, expect a few unexpected costs. Go through your projection line by line with your contractor and be clear about what isn’t included in their quote. If money is a concern, pick a few pieces you’re in love with to splurge on and go for more affordable options for everything else. We paid about $50,000 for both rooms, all-inclusive of work and materials. We went for the pricier appliance package, which cost about $8k.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s such an incredible feeling to transform a space into exactly what you want and what you need. We’ve never experienced that before. We now understand the appeal. Amazing! At home! It was worth every penny.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner, Samantha</i></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We bought what was essentially a flip and closed on it the month before our oldest daughter, </span><span class="s1">now almost seven, arrived. We finished the buildout that became her bedroom the night before her birth. The apartment’s finishes weren&#8217;t our favorite, but we had our own place, and were a family. I’ve been a stay-at-home mom (with a creative-industry résumé); Jameson is a partner and the digital director at Athletics, a Brooklyn-based creative studio.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47279 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg" alt="family portrait" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Portrait-3-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<h3>Outgrowing a home they love</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">After having our second daughter nearly four years ago, we knew the apartment needed to change. </span><span class="s5">We </span><span class="s1">loved its location in the Clinton Hill Co-Ops and our hope was to extend our time in this place and the neighborhood. Our growing daughters needed room more than ever, and we wanted to overhaul our kitchen and bathroom. It was time</span><span class="s5"> to make this home more liveable for our family.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">We <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/32505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted our project</a> on Sweeten and began our search for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/truth-design-build-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a design-build firm</a>. We wanted someone who could help make our space bright and modern, nodding to both Midcentury and California design. Time was tight—we were looking to renovate during our kids’ summer break and move back in before school resumed—and when we weren’t excited about any of the contractors we were initially matched with, Sweeten quickly presented more options, including some who’d worked in our co-ops. That sold us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-47275 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samantha-Kitchen-Storage-5.gif" alt="toe kick storage" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></span></p>
<h3>The kitchen kicks off the apartment renovation</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">I’m a big cook, and it was top-of-the-list for me that our kitchen renovation was as functional as possible. Secondary, but non-negotiable: We wanted the whole apartment to be social, conducive to entertaining, and hanging out. We realized that opening the kitchen to the living room could help us achieve both goals, letting me see my family in the living room while I’m in the kitchen cooking. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The dining area, previously over by the window, flip-flopped with the living room sofa, to make the table easily reachable. We also added a breakfast counter within the cutout, letting me interact with the girls while they eat breakfast or do homework and unload about the day. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The new kitchen is a pleasure to work in. We chose top-of-the-line appliances and built in the refrigerator, creating a giant cabinet above it. There was other storage, too, to house the accessories I’d collected. Wide, shallow drawers installed by our contractor in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/unique-features-for-home-remodel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinet kickplates give me an awesome</a> place to store my serving pieces and cast-iron pans. Our color palette was basic with matte white and rift-oak cabinetry and black accents. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t be afraid to ask for what I wanted.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid-friendly soundproofing for bedroom doors</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Previously, our daughters’ shared bedroom had French doors opening to the living and dining room; they weren’t soundproof, so when the kids went to bed at 8pm, Jameson and I felt like we had to retire to our bedroom. With the new layout and the kitchen opening to the bedrooms, we <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/soundproof-your-room-or-apartment-4062945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed a sound-blocking pocket door</a> for the girls’ room. Now we can have company over or stay up late watching television or listening to music, never worrying we’ll wake them. </span></p>

<h3>Flooring idea: Terrazzo</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Another high-quality splurge was on the eco-friendly terrazzo flooring for the kitchen. I’ve always loved the style as a component of Midcentury modernism. This choice, and the whole process, taught me that I shouldn’t <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/general-contractor-101-find-one-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be afraid to ask for what I wanted</a>. We still came in under budget for both renovation and furniture.</span></p>
<h3>A bath refresh in navy and brass</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">While we decided against a full reno of our bathroom, some improvements were made, adding style and storage without gutting it. The room was done in basic black and white, so when I found the navy blue and brass vanity cabinet, I thought it would add visual interest. The old, space-wasting pedestal sink was replaced with a smaller basin and the drawered unit. The black light fixture and shower-curtain rod match hardware in other rooms—we updated the doorknobs and fixtures throughout the place, and it made a huge visual impact.</span></p>
<h3>Sweeten contractor completes punch list</h3>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">My favorite part of the project was moving back in. Our new home is a joy! We had all of the art we’ve collected over the years professionally framed and hung. We achieved our objective of making our home feel worldly, warm, and timeless. After the project wrapped, our contractor even came back a few times to complete punch-list items and handle touch-ups. I love all of the finished elements. It makes me happy to come home, and we all love spending time here, comfortable, at ease, just hanging out in a place we truly love. </span></p>

			<h2>Consider board approvals, permits, and costs involved during layout changes</h2>

<h3>Preparing for a smooth renovation</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a first-time homeowner or you’ve been through the process a few times, it’s exciting to purchase a condo or co-op in New York City. You might expect to have some control over how the interior layout flows and functions. And you do&#8230; sort of. If you are considering a layout change, here&#8217;s how to prepare for the real cost implications. The outline below will help you decide if a layout change in NYC is a feasible starting point for your project.</p>
<h3><strong>What constitutes a layout change?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New York City groups layout changes into two categories of work permits.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Alteration Type-I involves major structural modifications to the building</li>
<li>Alteration Type-II projects won&#8217;t change the building’s use or occupancy terms. However, there will be work done on the vital systems hidden behind the walls. This includes re-routing plumbing lines, gas lines, electrical wiring, vertical piping, or ventilation ducts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a co-op or condo owner in NYC, there are few instances where you&#8217;ll make structural modifications to the building. But, if you are planning to do the following, your permit will be an alteration Type-II:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Relocate or <a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/kitchen/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand a kitchen</a> or bathroom</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Add a new bathroom</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Take down a load-bearing wall</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/lp/bathroom/renovations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Move fixtures in the bathroom</a> or kitchen</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These updates all require opening walls and may affect existing plumbing, gas, and electrical lines. They are the bread-and-butter of Type-II alterations. The bottom line: if your renovation goes beyond directly swapping out the surface components of a room, then you are probably dealing with a layout change. <a href="https://sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a> contractors have experience with the remodeling process and approvals in buildings throughout NYC. They will be able to guide you through each step.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wet-over-dry</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, why is a layout change such a big deal? And, why might your plans get denied? With people living in such close proximity to one another, the City has to be exceedingly careful about water and gas line safety. Similarly, many co-op and condo boards want to minimize situations where residents might be exposed to loss or damage from renovations in adjacent units. This often means that building boards do not permit residents to move “wet” spaces like kitchens and baths over “dry” spaces like a downstairs neighbor’s living room or bedroom. A building&#8217;s pipe stacks run vertically up and down the height of the structure. So, moving kitchen and bath lines can increase the danger of flooding and expand areas that are vulnerable to leaks and flooding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZViC8qWml4U&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img decoding="async" title="alteration-agreement-q-and-a" class="alignleft wp-image-48127 mb-48 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/QA-AltAgreement.jpg" alt="alteration agreement q and a image in blue and white" width="1000" height="85" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/QA-AltAgreement.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/QA-AltAgreement-300x26.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/QA-AltAgreement-600x51.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Get co-op and condo board approval</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You do have to play by house rules if you’re in a co-op or condo, and the building board is legally authorized to make rules and regulations for many aspects, including renovation plans. So, the first step is to <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check if a layout change is an option</a> with your building management. Your building probably has a <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/nyc-alteration-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document called an &#8220;alteration agreement.</a>&#8221; It details the steps and paperwork required to make any changes to your unit. The document will probably require you to submit an alteration application for approval. These vary by building but typically detail:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Scope of work permitted</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">How work is performed</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Legal ramifications and indemnification</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Insurance coverage requirements for the proposed plan</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The board may also require you to submit architectural plans, drawings, and specifications. They will be prepared by a licensed architect or engineer that you hire. They may also engage their own architect or engineer to review the submission and mandate any revisions required to minimize disruption. Sweeten homeowner, Jan Eliasberg, <a href="https://sweeten.com/sweeten-renovations/entire-home-renovations/apartment-remodel-on-the-upper-west-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked with her co-op board</a> to include central air in her renovation scope—a first-time feature in the building.</p>
<h3><strong>Get department of building approvals and permits</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The City requires you to file your plans with the Department of Buildings (and possibly the Landmarks Preservation Commission depending on where your apartment is located) before any work begins. For most layout changes, you will need to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/who-do-i-hire-first-my-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire a registered architect</a> or professional engineer to file a permit application. This certifies that the plan complies with applicable codes and laws. Once the plan is approved, your contractor also applies for a work permit to authorize the specific alterations detailed in your plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Plan for costs and timing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting approvals from building boards and the NYC Department of Buildings takes patience and perseverance. You can expect the process to take anywhere from two to six months (longer depending on a number of variables for a board review).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The documentation and services needed to get City approval come at a cost, as does the physical (and more specialized) labor you may need for layout reconfiguration. Rather than thinking about cost per room, you may find it more realistic to think about cost per square foot. Major renovations involving layout changes typically start in the range of $150 – $250 per square foot. An additional approximately 20 – 35% is required for design fees, permit filing services, and permit and inspection fees that an architect, engineer, and expediter will charge. You need to be prepared for these design and administrative fees on top of your budget for construction materials and labor.</p>
<h3>Needing licensed plumbers and electricians</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may need to hire licensed experts for more specialized mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work. Their hourly rate is higher than a typical handyman&#8217;s. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Most electrical work needs to be performed by a licensed electrician</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Any work on gas lines must be performed by an NYC Licensed Master Plumber</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Any plumbing work beyond the direct replacement of a fixture or a simple repair requires a licensed plumber</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These skilled trades all require training and licensing where layout changes are concerned. As a result, higher labor costs must be factored in. You&#8217;ll want to <a href="https://sweeten.com/process-and-planning/the-ultimate-guide-to-hiring-general-contractors-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire an experienced general contractor</a> who has working relationships with these professionals to call on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get a handle on how much a renovation will be, our NYC cost guides are a good place to begin. A <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-cost-guides/kitchen-remodeling-costs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen budget increases</a>, for example, if a wall comes down or plumbing fixtures move. The finish level (budget or high-end?) you choose will also influence the cost. <span class="s1">When you’re ready to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get started on your kitchen or home remodel</a>, discuss with a Sweeten contractor how your vision can be created in your particular space.</span></p>

<p>A gut renovation involves layers of costs, design, timing, and permits. This kind of renovation may at first seem mysterious and full of uncertainties. Ultimately, having the right contractor who knows how to handle any unexpected gut renovation challenges is key to a successful remodel. Below, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a> outlines hidden gut renovation challenges during a remodel to help you prep in advance.</p>
<p><em>Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</em></p>
<h3>Plan for hidden problems under floors and walls</h3>
<p>Gutting and renovating a house often reveals unpleasantries, like black mold, termite activity, rotting studs, and joists or foundation issues. The best way to handle these is through discovery and repair, which will prevent problems from worsening as time goes on. Perform this due diligence with your contractor so they can provide a more accurate cost estimate and work schedule.</p>
<h3>Clearly communicate about timing &amp; scheduling</h3>
<p>Surprise: homeowners and contractors are often on the same page with timing and scheduling. It may be surprising to hear that most contractors want to move your project along at a brisk yet efficient pace! Along with subcontractors and tradesmen, your project is likely one of many projects they are working on.</p>
<p>Having healthy communication with your contractor will keep the project moving along.  Homeowners should feel comfortable asking practical questions and raising various issues. Also, provide timely responses to a contractor’s questions by text, phone, or email. This is vital since no <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/licensed-contractor-vital-renovation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legitimate contractor will undertake tasks</a> that you have not ordered and signed off on. (Also, it will help your gut renovation stay on pace!)</p>
<p>Before starting any work, you and the contractor will develop a timeline for the project. While building and renovation schedules always have some built-in flexibility, the goal should be to stick to that schedule as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Costs for a gut renovation: Controlling the budget</h3>
<p>You want your home’s gut renovation to cost <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/how-to-compare-estimates-level-bids-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as close to the estimate as possible</a>. Once a contract has been accepted and signed, most contractors also want to bring the project in at cost (or close to it).</p>
<p>Homeowners undertaking serious gut remodels should build in an extra cash reserve for issues that come up along the way. Add in an additional 10 to 15 percent above the expected budget for a non-gut remodel, and add more than 15% for a gut remodel.</p>
<p>All of these &#8220;extra cost&#8221; issues are addressed in an orderly way via the change order: regular adjustments to the original contract that accommodate extra work, and which are signed by both you and the contractor.</p>
<h3>Gutting a house? Architects &amp; designers need extra time.</h3>
<p>If you plan on working with an architect or designer, be sure there is sufficient lead time for your design team to do their work. The bulk of the design team&#8217;s work comes before any physical remodel work happens. A solid design plan must come before the first piece of drywall or plaster is removed from the home.</p>
<h3>Handle hazardous materials safely</h3>
<p>Fortunately, consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of home renovation waste. This is good, as hazardous materials found during the project must be properly dealt with! These materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walls painted with lead-based paint</li>
<li>Asbestos insulation packed around pipes, in tile mastic, or in loose-fill insulation</li>
<li>Black mold, which can impact respiratory functions</li>
</ul>
<p>No hazardous waste case is totally unsolvable. However, you&#8217;ll need qualified subcontractors to help, and they must be added to the overall plan for cost and timing. Sometimes, a hazardous material can stay in place if left undisturbed, or if it is contained.</p>
<h3>Permits, codes, &amp; approvals for gutting and renovating a house</h3>
<p>Nearly every gut home renovation needs some type of permit or approval by a legal entity.</p>
<p>If you live in a condo, alterations may need to be approved by the board. For owners of houses controlled by a housing association (HOA), interior improvements typically do not need to be approved by the HOA (but exterior improvements do!)</p>
<p>Owners of condos and single-family detached houses under an HOA must seek approval and permits from their local permit agency. It covers a wide range of activities for a gut renovation.</p>
<p>Removing a load-bearing wall, electrical and plumbing work, and major HVAC work are examples of sub-projects that likely will require a permit. Owners of properties in dense metro areas usually need to secure permits for trash dumpsters parked on the street.</p>
<p>Contractors perform a valuable service when it comes time to arrange, or pull, the permits. The contractor or representative will manage this whole process. This includes making visits to the permit office and meeting with inspectors at the building site.</p>
<h3>Neighbors and the neighborhood</h3>
<p>Simpler updates like window replacements, flooring installation, or interior painting are often unnoticed by neighbors. But gut home renovations, especially those involving the entire house, can draw attention. A trash dumpster on the street or multiple tradesmen vans parked by your home hint to others that major work is happening.</p>
<p>Neighbor <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/good-neighbors-heads-renovation-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relations are best handled by </a>the homeowner before the project begins. Take the time to inform your neighbors of the upcoming work. Speak to your contractor about how they handle noise ordinances or illegal parking.</p>
<p>Hopefully, being aware of the type of bumps you may encounter during a gut renovation will be helpful in smoothing the path forward. The right contractor will be a partner in guiding you during this renovation process.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>We’re back again this week with Part 2 of Nazli and Larry’s historic Brooklyn brownstone renovation in Bedford-Stuyvesant. If you missed it—check out <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/family-renovates-brooklyn-brownstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part I</a></i></span><span class="s1"><i> where Nazli walked us through their planning process and showed off the foyer and guest suite. Here, she shows off the rest of the parlor floor, including the kitchen, the dining room, and the powder room. Nazli explains the challenge of merging modern and traditional within the confines of a townhouse’s long and narrow configuration. Read on for her thoughts on powder rooms (wackiness is key), decorative mantels (rather pointless), and coming to terms with the budget required to achieve the renovation you want (very tough).</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the biggest challenge to any renovation is…the renovators obviously. There will always be a push and pull between the architect, the contractor, and the owners. And most of the time, that will yield a better product than any single entity could have envisioned (but not always). I think our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten architect was fantastic</a> in coming up with some great solutions to space challenges–especially on the parlor floor, where I insisted we needed a half-bath that was nowhere near the kitchen (because, gross), a hall closet, and a kitchen pantry. She really provided a lot of help in making sure the house was up to code and that the spaces flowed. Our contractor (and my husband’s best friend), did an awesome job of value engineering so we could get the most bang for our buck. The decorating of the spaces was left mostly to me and it was interesting trying to figure out my own taste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, like all imperfect clients, wanted this Brooklyn brownstone renovated on a contractor&#8217;s-grade budget. Obviously, we were being silly and went way over budget (and right at what our contractor told us it would cost; we were just deeply in denial about the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/nyc-home-renovation-cost-per-square-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of construction</a> in NYC). The mechanicals in a home are so expensive that basically most of the money was gone before we made a single design choice. And for me, I care deeply about the fixtures, finishes, and materials and I wasn’t about to cheap out on the things we had to see and use every day. So just be honest with yourself about what you want and what you’re willing to pay or give up for it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was most excited about the kitchen<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>if that hasn’t already been made clear. I love throwing huge parties and dinners, and I like to spend my alone time cooking. It’s also a natural gathering spot, so it was exciting to think about getting the most out of the space. Turns out the space configuration of a Brooklyn brownstone made it hard to do that, but it still served us well—I am super happy with a long <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/5-kitchen-islands-land-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island</a> (11 feet long!), a BlueStar stove, and the different stations for cooking, eating, making coffee, or baking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The kitchen is my happy spot and I’ve spent years thinking about what makes a good kitchen. Is this ideal space planning? Nope. Is this my idea of a good time? For sure. The challenge was how to devise an open-plan area that was going to take up so much of the parlor floor without making it feel like a separate room. My solution was to forgo upper <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/cabinet-ideas-boost-kitchen-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabinets</a> so there&#8217;s a clear line of vision from the front of the room all the way to the dining room. This created a storage challenge for me, of course, which we solved with a kitchen pantry. I wanted the pantry to be open so that I could see and access all my ingredients easily, but I also didn’t want a lot of visual clutter. I <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painted</a> the cabinets and shelves a deep gray (same color as the island cabinets), which makes the whole space disappear once I turn out the light. I found a piece of scrap marble at the stone yard which I used for the kitchen backsplash and the countertops along the back wall closest to the pantry. Marble is expensive and hard to maintain, so my thought was to use it in low-use areas to give the look and feel of the material throughout the kitchen without spending that much. For the island and other countertops, I used poured concrete, which is a material I love. Surprisingly, it’s also pretty delicate, but it’s subtle and earthy and I like how it ages. The kitchen is, again, more traditional than I would have preferred, but I think the concrete and the open shelving give it a more modern touch. Also, I fought to get a second sink in the kitchen and am so happy I won that battle. It’s handy to set up a water station so people can grab water or rinse out cups without interrupting my cooking space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t say enough about how much I love these herringbone walnut <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floors</a>. We splurged on these floors and went with the less costly white oak for the upstairs floors because…well, just look at them. My original vision was to have the tile floor in the kitchen, but it made more sense to continue the wood on the whole parlor floor and save the tile for the back extension. We mocked up the island with plywood and adjusted it until I was happy with the dimensions—how it felt to go from sink to stove, or how easy it was to take food out of the fridge and place it on the counter. That kind of stuff is important to me, and this was the first time I really got to design my own kitchen for myself. Everything is a bit taller and it suits me just great.</p>
<p>A note on accessibility: I’ve had friends and families with different mobility and impairment issues—whether wheelchair-bound, deaf, or arthritic—and time spent with them has made me very conscious of what it means to design well for many. A landmarked Brooklyn brownstone is a nightmare for anyone with a wheelchair, a walker, or a stroller, and I also saw firsthand some of the challenges that my design choices presented.</p>
<p>The first set of cabinet pulls in the kitchen were a lovely set of straight, minimalist tab pulls. I loved that they gave the kitchen a more modern look. Cue my mother and mother-in-law coming over all the time and struggling with the pulls. They couldn’t grasp the straight pull with their arthritic fingers. I switched them out right away for pulls with a fully curved handle. Now they can just stick their finger under the pull, and a small motion opens the drawers. People keep talking about their &#8220;forever homes,&#8221; but really think about how you, your guests, and your children will have to adapt to the spaces as everyone starts to get older.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other end of our Brooklyn brownstone, and connected to the kitchen, is the dining room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/6-home-bar-ideas-that-deserve-a-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar</a>. We love this room. We really felt like this room, a back extension added in the 1910s, was the reason we bought this place. Then we sadly rebuilt the entire room, but somehow, it’s still our favorite space in the house. So that was a great surprise—buying a house because of one room and then recreating it and still having that be the best spot in the house. It’s our dining room and bar, but we also have space under the dining bench to store all of Nacho’s gear so that he can draw and play at the table while I am cooking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From being in other friends’ homes, I knew that extensions were always freezing cold and hard to heat. All I wanted was Moroccan tile for this room (in fact, for the whole house, but we just didn’t have the budget for that). Everyone fought me on adding radiant heating to the subfloor, but it’s by far the warmest room during the winter. Larry and I often come home and lie down on the floor and accidentally fall asleep! During the summer, this is the room we hang out in while kids run in and out of the house to the backyard. The best surprise? That giant Tiffany stained-glass window, which was hidden by a crappy 1970’s bookcase on the inside and vinyl siding on the outside. As soon as we bought the house, we ripped down the bookcase hoping we’d find a window, and lo and behold, we did. It was in near perfect condition. We completely sealed it with clear glass on the outside to avoid damage and heat loss, as we did with all the other stained glass details around the parlor floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a large fireplace in this room, but I couldn’t figure out how to fit the mantel and Larry’s bar, and after much cajoling, I finally convinced Larry to agree to rip out the fireplace. The mantel has a new home in the living room, where the original had been removed previously. I will say, to the horror of preservationists everywhere, that I wish we didn’t have our mantels—they don’t work, they take up too much space, and they create artificial focal points in every room. Maybe if they were marble, I’d appreciate them more. It’s form without function, which I have no love for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The powder room was a tough one to figure out. I hate the idea of guests having to go upstairs to use the bathroom, and with a small child, it&#8217;s great to have a bathroom on every floor. I think powder rooms should be wacky. This one is tiny, so doing a fun wallpaper or paint color was relatively cheap. I love the electric Cole &amp; Sons Palms wallpaper—it adds a touch of fun to an otherwise formal dining room. I also love the pop of color from the door to the powder room. We hated having the stained glass window facing a dull orange wall because it cast a weird orangey glow into the room. Rather than fight it, though, we decided to paint the door an amped-up version of that wall to tie the colors together in a fun way.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Open up a small kitchen in a one-bedroom Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Marissa, who has had a “varied career” in theater and finance, purchased the 630-square-foot Prospect Heights co-op in 2012 and <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/prospect-heights-bathroom-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renovated the bathroom</a> in 2014 (with Sweeten!). The photo of her bathroom has been saved 7,614 times <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/575616396101361090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Pinterest</a> to date and is Sweeten&#8217;s most saved pin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marissa planned on renovating the kitchen in the spring of 2016, but got married to her then-boyfriend, Jeremy, instead. If they had tried to plan a wedding and do a remodel simultaneously, “we would probably run out of money and, someone—me—was going to have a nervous breakdown coordinating both,” she recounts. So they put the renovation on hold until well after the wedding. They considered renovating based on choices made purely for resale reasons but decided to follow their particular vision instead. “It was going to be way more expensive than a traditional kitchen flip,” she said. “But, in my defense, design is an important part of my life and how often will I get a chance to design a gut-renovated kitchen?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The apartment hadn’t been renovated since the 100-year-old building became a co-op in the early ‘80s. The kitchen worked, but was dated, lacked storage, and only had 24 square inches of usable counter space. The couple are avid cooks and the kitchen was so cramped, Marissa said, “that we had to instill a rule of only one person allowed in the kitchen at a time—for marital harmony and personal safety.” A raised bar on the peninsula further blocked the kitchen from the living room. “That was a bit isolating for both the cook and the non-cook when all you want to do is reconnect with your spouse after work while prepping dinner,” she explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33015 size-chrono" title="blue-wall-paper-brown-floor" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg" alt="blue wall paper and brown vinyl floor in white kitchen with built in hob before renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-02.jpg 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-05.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33018 mb-0 size-chrono" title="brown-white-kitchen-cabinets-before" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-05-723x1085.jpg" alt="brown and white kitchen cabinets and sink before renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-05.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-Before-05-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the living room and bedroom walls were dark, the new kitchen needed to be lighter to balance out the space. “I wouldn’t have gone with a white kitchen if I didn’t have the lighting decisions correct, though,” said Marissa, who drew from her background as a theater lighting designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After</span>: With a plan in mind, Marissa and Jeremy <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/6896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and chose a <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“wonderfully communicative” contractor</a>. He helped them get the layered lighting she envisioned, “where I needed it, at color temperatures that I liked, and that I could mix to be flattering so we could pull off a white kitchen. If we should age-in-place and need crazy bright lights one day, we have the ability to turn the kitchen into an airport runway. But for now, a mix of one-half to one-quarter intensity feels just right in our space.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“I sourced, purchased, and refinished the pendants on the peninsula and our contractor allowed me to measure the exact height I wanted them, texting me photos during the installation. He even installed dimmable, under-the-peninsula LED lighting for the cabinets facing the living room so that we can see what’s inside them in spite of the countertop overhang’s shadow!” Marissa loves the ability to control the lighting with such variability and said, “I can match any mood or task I require from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-14.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33032 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-peninsula-cabinets-open-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-14.gif" alt="white kitchen peninsula with cabinets in an open kitchen and white and purple wall after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly a bad duster—and one with pets—Marissa knew that open shelves instead of upper cabinets, “while super trendy and spacious feeling, just didn’t fit our lifestyle.” With all that open space, she might end up feeling annoyed by not having matching bowls on display. “And I certainly don’t need more things,” Marissa said. “I wanted it to straddle contemporary and traditional style and I feel my design was successful in that regard.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33031 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-pull-out-drawers" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-13.gif" alt="white kitchen pull out drawers and gold handles after renovation " width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Metal finishes were mixed to keep them from looking the same. “I went wild with the cabinet hardware. If I have a change of heart later, or a future buyer decides that they don’t like them, it’s an inexpensive and easy swap.” She was careful to use “classic” metals for the more complicated to replace items like the stainless steel appliances and sink, polished nickel faucet, sprayer, and soap dispenser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33025 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-kitchen-cabinets-purple-kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="white kitchen cabinets in a white and purple kitchen with marble countertop and hob" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-07.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the antique mirror backsplash, white marble-look quartz peninsula, and white cabinets were part of Marissa’s original plan, she admits the backsplash was a bit of a leap. “While mirrors are best for bouncing light in a space with few windows and making a room appear larger, I wanted an antiqued mirror so as to soften the reflections in it,” she said. For the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countertops</a>, there was a discussion about Calacatta Borghini marble, but Jeremy was concerned about upkeep. “I was less concerned because I think lived-in, scuffed up, and even stained marble is beautiful,” Marissa said. The quartz version of the marble look-alike ended up being the same price, easier to source, and less delicate. “We both love how gorgeous and low maintenance the countertops are,”  she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33029 mb-0 size-chrono" title="white-custom-kitchen-cabinets-gold-handles" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-723x1085.jpg" alt="white custom kitchen cabinets with gold handles and gray floor tiles after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-723x1085.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-11.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To gain counter space, they got a <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/washer-dryer-apartment-additions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">washer/dryer combo unit</a>. Previously, there was a stacked washer/dryer and a gas dryer vent. “While a gas dryer dries clothes much faster than a ventless dryer, I wanted the extra counter space more than I wanted clothes dried in 20 minutes,” Marissa said. They capped off the gas vent and went long with the back counter. “Now we put in our laundry at night and in the morning it’s dry and we have a nice clear counter above it to fold our clothes before we put them away. It fits our lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest challenge they faced was what Marissa calls “‘The Night of a Thousand Terrors, aka Emergency Plumbing Night,’ which ended up doubling our budget overages. We planned for a 20 percent budget overrun but spent closer to 50 percent more, because of that single night.” The demo exposed an unforeseen problem in the walls—pipes running through the middle of the newly expanded kitchen. As planned, it took a plumber three hours to retrofit the pipes into the space they needed to retain the kitchen’s orientation. But once the gas pipe was retrofitted, it was unable to be sealed: the condensation from nearby water pipes prevented the sealing materials from working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-33022 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg" alt="small kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-Marissa-Yoo-Kitchen-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a 16-hour emergency job with three plumbers, they had to shut down the entire apartment stack’s waterline and install drain valves in the basement for every apartment above them just to seal that one gas line (under newer building codes, these would have already been in place). The emergency work ended at 3:00 am and it wasn’t until the next morning that everyone’s water and gas was turned back on. “We sat on the front steps of the building, apologizing in person to all our neighbors who passed by during that horrific evening. We handmade apology cards and sent bottles of wine to all the affected neighbors and found a fun educational game to give to our toddler neighbor. People should build these apology gifts in as line items into their <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>,” Marissa said. “But in the bigger scheme—our stack of apartments now has drains installed where they should be.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the challenges, Marissa and Jeremy are thrilled with their new kitchen. “I am excited about so many parts of our kitchen that I don’t know if I can pick a favorite!” she said. “I love that we quintupled (or more) our counter space, I love that I can independently control the intensity of all of the lighting in the kitchen, and I love that I can have a conversation with my husband while one of us is in the kitchen and the other is on the couch.” Working with her Sweeten general contractor was one of the highlights of the project. “He was wonderful about checking in with me. His communication skills were top notch. I cannot stress enough how pleased I am with his finished work. He wanted things done the right way and not just the easiest way.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Marissa knew she needed an eye-catching piece for the wall above the peninsula. “It’s the first thing you will see, walking into the apartment,” she said. “I found a knife rack made out of dark walnut wood fairly easily (Amazon for the win!), but for the life of me, I couldn’t find a small interesting shelf.” She ended up coming across an octagonal shelf on Wayfair that “charmed” her with its shape but was the wrong color so she painted the black metal gold and stained the wood with a darker shade before assembling it.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Written in partnership with Sweeten homeowner Brett</i></span></p>
<h3>In need of something bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a baby on the way and an energetic dog named Alfie, Terri Lee and Brett Appel needed a larger apartment. The couple had a design advantage from the start: Brett runs his own custom residential architecture practice and Terri works for one of the largest architecture firms in New York. They wanted to find something that they could gut renovate and design to their own specifications.</p>
<h3><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg" alt="Brett sitting on a chair posing for photo near built-in book shelves after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51517" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-30-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />A completely gutted remodel</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment was in an 82-unit co-op in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. It was in terrible condition, which made it easier to rip everything out and redesign the apartment exactly the way they wanted. They found their contractor after talking with friends (one of whom is also an architect) who <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/architect-delivers-on-her-duplex-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had used Sweeten</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg" alt="open living and dining with hardwood floors and white walls and half wall book shelves as room divider or partition after renovation" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51495" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-08-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/20728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri and Brett posted their project</a> on Sweeten, they were upfront about the existing conditions and scope of work. They wanted a contractor who would tell them whether the work could be done within their budget, or if they needed to scale back. “Fortunately, we found the right contractor who was very happy to work with us so we could get everything we wanted,” Brett said.</p>

<h3>Making the space look bigger</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The couple’s design vision was to combine shades of gray with natural wood to make the home seem as bright and large as possible without being too monotone. “We also didn’t want the renovated space to compete with our brightly colored furniture,” Brett said. Their primary objective in terms of gaining space was to add a second bathroom, which they achieved by rearranging the bedroom doors and reducing the size of the hallway closets.</p>

<h3>Challenges in the foyer</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The entry foyer was a bit of a challenge. It’s two steps above the living room and contains the dining space, which was small. They relocated the steps down to the living room from the center to the side and replaced the guardrails with a continuous double-sided built-in bookcase custom-designed by the contractor’s millworker. The raised platform was extended to create a larger dining space, while the closet expanded for more stroller storage. New wide-plank European oak engineered flooring was installed throughout.</p>

<h3>Rearranging the walls</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When they found the apartment, the existing walls were plaster—probably at least 60 years old and poorly done. “One of the walls in the <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-conversations/jean-qa-skim-coat-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">living room was so uneven and bumpy</a>, it looked like it was made out of pillowcases,” Brett recalled. They ultimately decided to fur out the walls–a process to construct a new wall in front of the old one. “We attached 1x3s to the existing wall and then put new sheetrock on those. We lost a little space (about 1 1/2&#8243; per wall), but this saved us about $6,000,” Brett said. The other option to straighten crooked walls would have been &#8220;demolishing the plaster and lathe, placing new studs, and then new sheetrock,&#8221; which would have been more expensive and time-consuming.</p>

<h3>Covering the radiator</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The master bedroom closet was reframed to function as a walk-in. Other details included the custom radiator covers in the bedroom and living room, crafted by the millworker; leftover stone from the kitchen counters was used for the radiator sills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terri and Brett designed these covers together. The existing radiators had an old painted steel cover that had not weathered very well. The millworker made the slatted fronts on removable clips so the radiator could be accessed for maintenance. The new millwork needed a top/windowsill but the couple decided that painted MDF would not last very long. Brett had to purchase two slabs of stone for the kitchen to cover the countertops and backsplash. There was a lot of leftover stone that easily fit the sills.</p>

<h3>An ADA-compliant layout</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have a lot of flexibility designing the kitchen and bathroom layouts. It had to be ADA-compliant since we rearranged everything,” Brett explained. They focused on finishes. In the kitchen, they imagined the countertops and backsplash as the “feature” elements with everything else as the background, &#8220;which is why the floors and cabinets are all different shades of gray,” he said. The couple loves unique, natural stones and found that quartzites have the most movement and veining, which worked well with their gray cabinets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg" alt="gray bathroom floor tiles and white floating vanity with mirror and toilet and bathtub and floor to ceiling wall tiles after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51516" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20728-Brett-Apt-29-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><br />
<span style="color: #76808f;"><em>(Above)</em> Master bath</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both bathrooms were made to seem bigger and brighter by making the walls white and using marble tile in the master and subway tile in the guest. In the master bath, Brett said, he “had some fun connecting the shower niche with the existing windowsill.” Terri scoured the Internet to find an aquatic-themed wallpaper for the guest bathroom. Wood shelves were incorporated in each to provide a little warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brett was most excited about the new rain shower in the added bathroom. “All of my previous apartments—for basically my entire life—only had a bathtub, so it feels very luxurious to shower in a large glass box,” he said.</p>

<h3>A recommendation for clients</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the renovation, Brett had wanted to test out Sweeten’s service to see if he would recommend it to his own clients. After this experience, he said he would. “We didn’t need much assistance from Sweeten because I have experience managing projects like these professionally, but I felt reassured knowing that Sweeten would be able to assist if any serious problems came up. Luckily, our contractor was great and we didn’t have any issues,” Brett said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Terri and I are perpetually impressed that we were able to design the apartment exactly to our needs,&#8221; says Brett. &#8220;Our families come over frequently now and we love that we were able to add a second bathroom. It really helps make ‘our’ space feel more private.&#8221; As an architect couple, they worked well together. &#8220;It helps to come up with a central concept or theme at the beginning,&#8221; Brett said. &#8220;There will always be disagreements but we could then ask ourselves &#8216;does this fit our initial vision&#8217; and make a decision together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A long-distance relationship blooms, from start to reno punch list</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kim and Ian were both far from home when a chance encounter in Spain brought them together. When the couple decided to close the distance between them—10,000 miles!—they found a studio apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. The previous tenant had lived in the home for nearly half a century, and during a walk-through, Kim and Ian discovered that the original plumbing and wiring were in need of an overhaul. Challenges aside, the space was just the right size for the two of them and full of good vibes—not to mention a fortuitous discovery in one of the walls. Ready to make it their home, the couple embraced a gut renovation of the entire apartment. Read on for Ian’s take on their remodeling journey.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The story begins in northern Spain along the Camino de Santiago, where an aging Aussie trial lawyer met and fell in love with a not-so-aging American nurse who just happened to be working in Manhattan and living in Bayonne, New Jersey. Many cross-Pacific flights later, plans were made for a wedding in Hawaii and the purchase of an apartment somewhere on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where we could live together when I was able to escape court commitments in Sydney. With both of us having been married before with adult children, there was no need for a large apartment, but there was a definite need for the best use of a small space.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The search for an affordable apartment was challenging to say the least. But thanks to the StreetEasy website and FaceTime (for my wife in Bayonne and myself in Sydney), a studio apartment in a 1915 co-op was located and purchased. The 450-square-foot space was previously owned by a retired nun who had lived in it for some 45 years (long enough ago to remember John and Yoko walking down the street from the Dakota apartments). The old girl (the apartment!) required a total renovation but had a good vibe about it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Given that I am from Sydney and my wife is from Bayonne, locating a suitable contractor was also challenging. After much Googling, I located the Sweeten website and was immediately fascinated by the Sweeten concept. So much so, that more out of interest than any real expectation, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/16664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I posted a quick job description</a> on the website and a hopeful (very hopeful!) budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With hindsight, I understated the renovation work required to a significant extent. While awaiting responses from Sweeten, I also contacted contractors I had identified from various magazines and other websites. Immediate ballpark quotes of $150k upwards from these folks sent shivers through my bones. Then interviews with potential contractors were arranged by Sweeten with the search ending in a coin toss between the two final contractors. After <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deciding on the Sweeten contractor</a>, who won out largely because he was both a qualified architect and builder, the renovating process began. The detailed quoted price was more than reasonable and way under $150k quoted by others.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30520 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During02-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a>(Right) Hidden window discovered<a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30519 mt-24 size-chrono" title="during" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT-During01-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30490 mb-24 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT03-723x482.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30489 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT21.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suppose it&#8217;s axiomatic that the design stage of any renovation is not ideal when one of the players lives mainly overseas. But as luck would have it, a trial in Sydney collapsed and I was able to fly to New York for a thorough “walk through” with my wife Kim and our contractor after the building contract was signed. I had two absolute requirements—a new soaking <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/freestanding-tub-bath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tub</a> and new <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/hardwood-flooring-how-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solid oak flooring</a> throughout. Kim also had absolute requirements: a nice cooking area and island, and new everything else! After weeks of to-and-froing, preparing and amending the plans, work was ready to commence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s no exaggeration to say that what was required was, in effect, a gut renovation of the whole apartment. Laying new oak flooring was going to require the removal of two layers of old parquetry flooring. Hidden in the wall adjacent to the neighboring building (a contemporary high-rise) were two old large windows from a time when the building next door was an old brownstone. Our contractor’s eyes lit up at the sight, explaining how he could remove the windows and use the cavity space for <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storage cabinets</a> and counter space, both considered premiums in NYC studio apartments. I am a lover of wood, and the contractor proposed the cabinets and doors be made of American walnut and mahogany veneer. The final look and function of both pieces of furniture—a matching clothes cabinet hangs at the foot of the bed—are terrific and make excellent use of an otherwise wasted wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30494 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT10-723x1085.jpg" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30493 mb-0 size-chrono" title="pull-out storage" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SWEETEN-Ian-Lloyd-APT01.gif" alt="studio renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p>Plans for the main space involved splitting the studio into a cooking/dining/working area and a living/sleeping area. With the kitchen island as the primary divider, the plans were fine-tuned, including a design for a reconfigured bathroom. To be effective, a complete <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewiring</a> and re-plumbing of the whole apartment was required. This also involved breaking into the ceiling of the apartment below ours to put in new pipes and ball joints as required by the co-op management. Our Sweeten contractor did all the arranging with the downstairs apartment owner and diplomatically handled inevitable noise complaints. The guts were ripped out of the apartment and walls replaced.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The price quoted by the contractor to do the building work did not include the appliances, bath fixtures and other items such as tile, lighting, and flooring. We made use of various websites and sourced mainly high-end products, all of which when installed look fabulous and add value to the overall project. The sourcing and purchasing of items over the Internet was a real boon, seamlessly saving both shoe leather and thousands of dollars in cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Timing became an issue. Our contractor’s hope at the outset was for the project to be completed within three to four months. But with the unforeseen need for the gut renovation, including rewiring and re-plumbing, the project did blow out substantially in timing. Waiting for the soaking tub (Kaldewei) to come from Germany, the kitchen feature light (Vistosi) to come from Italy, and the kitchen faucet (Franke) to come from Switzerland also prolonged the completion date by months. Luckily, we both had other homes in which to live while the work took place. Now that the work’s done, the angst with the delay seems trivial.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We finally moved into the apartment in early December 2017 when I arrived from Sydney for an extended stay with Kim in New York. Living here has been terrific. And I’ve put the tub to good use throughout the very cold winter! The layout, feel, and livability of the apartment has exceeded my expectations. We’ve had some teething issues with bits and pieces (cracked tile, cabinetry needing adjusting, painting touch-ups) but our contractor has been most attentive to fixing any problem that has arisen. I must say though, as a Sydney-sider, the street noise in NYC coming into the apartment is a bit louder than I had expected. But as one of Kim’s friends said to me, “Soak it up mate, it’s all part of the New York experience.” Let the good times continue!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s begin with the impetus for the whole move: our little roommate, Nacho. As far as roommates go, this one is not so bad. He’s demanding and he struggles to clean up after himself, but man oh man, do we love this guy. We wanted to move into a home to give him a better sense of what it means to grow up in a community: to plant flowers in the tree pits with our neighbors, to attend block association meetings (where he gets to call the meeting to order), to hang on the stoop, meet neighbors and observe street life, and to have the space to run around and be a kid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is so much I miss about apartment living. I’m a total city brat, but to see Nacho lose it when he hears birds outside or sees a squirrel running around the backyard is pretty darn amazing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25768" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-42-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span><span class="s1"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">New life for the brownstone bedrooms</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nacho&#8217;s playroom is separated by sliding doors from a small bedroom where he sleeps. At some point, Nacho may move to the playroom, or we may convert the small bedroom to another guest bedroom or office or a nursery—who knows? Point is, I like the flexibility with the two joined yet separate spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/bedroom-storage-style-renovation-ideas/"><span class="s2">love the master bedroom</span></a>. It’s a good lesson on what paint can do for a room. This house taught me to go dark, and to appreciate the power of the color black. The entire room got new moldings and trim, and the original gross color on the walls was removed.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>
<span>&#8220;When we realized we had this little bit of extra space in our master bedroom suite, we quickly redesigned the bathroom&#8230;&#8221;</span>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adding character with the color black</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Brooklyn brownstone seemed to call for darker colors. Interestingly, the black paint doesn’t make the spaces feel dark or small. It makes our stairs feel like a real feature, it keeps the master bath from feeling like a blah condo bathroom, and it brings out the moldings and woodwork in our master bedroom. All of the rooms look elegant and uncluttered without feeling too stark. I’m a big fan. The colors also looked really different on walls versus woodwork and depending on how the light hit it. I had to choose between 15 different shades of black.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25776" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-31-585x390.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A luxury bathroom comes to life</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The master bathroom is cool. The whole bathroom started out with the wall-mounted faucet, and I designed the rest of the bathroom around it. I love the black tile wall and the concrete and wood vanity. Our architect created great drawings for the concrete guys and carpenter to use for the vanity and countertop. We saved a bit by using a beautiful teak veneer rather than solid teak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Design around who you are and how you behave. I realized that I was often late in the mornings because Larry would take forever in the bathroom. When we realized we had this little bit of extra space in our master bedroom suite, we quickly redesigned the bathroom, giving ourselves a long vanity with a single sink (I’d rather have more counter space), and created this little toilet room with its own sink.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">The well-located laundry room</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s get to the Real Housewives of Brooklyn—all we ever wanted was a laundry room that wasn’t tucked away in a creepy 200-year-old basement. After the dining room, this might be my favorite room in the house. I think that architecture directs behavior. When the laundry room is conveniently located, everyone does their laundry in a timely manner. It’s less about a love of doing laundry, which I obviously hate doing, and more about having a great appreciation for setting up a space where it can be done efficiently and where towels and sheets can be stored right away after folding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25784" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-600x900.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-19-723x1085.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>

<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">A man cave full of light</span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Larry was so excited to have his own office—formerly a bathroom—and couldn’t be happier with the setup. Everything is within arm’s reach, and there is enough built-in storage for his books and files. When we are running around in the house, he can shut the sliding doors and have his cave, while still allowing light in from the skylights because of the lovely <a href="https://sweeten.com/ideas-and-inspiration/transom-windows-let-the-light-in/"><span class="s2">transom windows we built in</span></a>. Our architect did a great job with the layout upstairs to ensure maximum light.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25785" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Nazli_Apartment-21-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our lounge is outside of Larry’s office, and it’s our Friday night hangout. At the end of every week, we like to tuck Nacho into bed and crawl on the couch to watch a movie. We’ve never made it past the first 15 minutes without falling asleep. Nevertheless, we love having a space just for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Larry likes having the doors to his office open and being able to watch a game while he works late into the night. The ability to open his office up to the lounge allows a lot of flexibility in the space, both now and in the future. We love that there’s no door to the lounge; it means stepping into a very open space as soon as you get to the top of the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m going to acknowledge that we are fortunate as New Yorkers to be able to afford and renovate this Brooklyn brownstone. It allowed us access to capital, insurance, and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/mortgage-101-everything-need-home-loans/"><span class="s2">loans</span></a> not available to most of our neighbors who were in fact systematically denied loans. I am aware that other people were forced to sell their homes for nothing. So while I’m happy to talk about tile, we are grateful for the choices we have been afforded in life, which got us to the point where our fights are about where to put a bathtub. Speaking of which…we didn’t get a bathtub. It’s just one of a million tiny regrets and shoulda-woulda’s that are unavoidable in this process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Thank you to Nazli, Larry, and Nacho for generously sharing your Brooklyn brownstone!</i></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Diving into a multi-story Brooklyn brownstone renovation, welcoming spaces like the foyer, guest bedroom, and bath get the luxe treatment for friends and family</span></h2>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1"><i>Today’s before and after kicks off a three-part series on a Brooklyn brownstone gut renovation in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2015, Nazli and Larry bought a four-story derelict townhouse and set out to create a home for themselves and their son Nacho. With refreshing honesty on topics ranging from marital disagreement to aging foresight, Nazli shares the behind-the-scenes process of decision-making and what it means to renovate for real life, beyond the photo shoot. The couple—she&#8217;s a consultant for government affairs and he is a broker—envisioned the house as an inviting space for their extended community of family and friends—a home away from home. Read on for Nazli’s take on their plans for the new townhouse, and the full reveal of their guest suite on the second floor. Fittingly, for a family that loves to host, it was the first room finished and ready for occupancy!</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We purchased our home in the <a href="https://www.brownstoner.com/history/bedford-historic-district-approved-by-landmarks-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly landmarked</a> Bedford Historic District. It was a single-family brownstone, roughly 4,000 square feet, which we converted into a two-family home with a garden rental and a triplex for ourselves. The home was built in 1890 by Bedford-Stuyvesant architect Montrose Morris, who also built the nearby Kelly Mansion. He built many of the premier properties for wealthy families of the time, though the four townhouses he built on our street were apparently more of an exercise in creating middle-class lodging. Our home was uninhabitable at the time of purchase, truly<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>no heat, no working bathrooms or kitchen, and just…not in good shape. There were original but defunct fireplaces, beautifully preserved paneling and plaster work on the walls, as well as some stained-glass windows (a happy surprise)<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>but no other details remained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We certainly did not go into our renovation thinking that it would be a gut—we couldn’t afford it and we didn’t think it would be necessary. But while attempting to figure out the mechanicals and ductwork, it quickly became apparent that it would be more efficient to take down all the crumbling walls and start from scratch. It wouldn’t be so much more expensive since the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems could be done anew, rather than trying to trace them up 130-year-old walls. There was also so much water damage throughout the house that none of the original flooring could be preserved. The house was a mess.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our goals were to meet the basic needs of our family, and tick items off our dream list. My basic vision of a home is a giant kitchen with some other rooms arranged nearby for whatever it is people do outside of a kitchen. Larry was really looking forward to having his own private office, which would allow him to work from home more often and spend more time with our son, Nacho. Our child only cares about fans, so we made sure we had a ceiling fan for him to play with (kidding). Collectively, we love to entertain, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of space for guests and could host for a while without it feeling like a strain. We also knew that as we and our families aged, our needs would be different, and wanted flexibility in how our spaces were configured to allow for changing needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My husband and I disagreed on most decisions (seriously, renovation is not for the faint-hearted), but there was also a really nice division of labor around what our priorities were. I could care less about the bells and whistles of a “smart” home, but my husband spent a lot of time and effort getting the house wired up on Nest thermostats, security systems, and a Sonos sound system, etc. It’s totally amazing to be able to hear music throughout the house, or turn the heat on remotely and come home to a warm home after a few days away. On the other hand, I really care about the flow of space and a house design that makes it easy to clean and maintain. I thought a lot about our storage options and made a million mock-ups of the kitchen and what each cabinet should be used for.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of how we imagined the home, I definitely pictured a more modern space than what we have, but we realized pretty quickly that the house, even with the few remaining details, called for a different type of treatment. Townhouses are tough: they are long and narrow and lighting is always tricky, and I think we both realized if we wanted an ultra-modern design we should have looked at a different type of property. We wanted to honor the feel of this Brooklyn brownstone and preserve as much of the plasterwork and recreate as much of the molding without feeling closed in—the way that many of the more traditional townhouses made us feel. Certainly, we wanted a design that felt as open as possible, but I’m a stickler for storage and we are not minimalists, so real-life storage solutions were key. This meant large closets in every room and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built-ins</a> where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were lucky enough <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/3494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to find</a> our <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">architect through Sweeten</a> and we really wanted her to come on to do drawings and filings because our contractor, who was also my husband’s best friend, really wanted design as he went along. The goal was to create a beautiful space that was flexible to changing tastes. I view the house, beyond some very bold choices in some of the rooms, as a really great blank canvas for great furniture and our art collection. I didn’t want too much millwork or details that would keep the house stuck in one genre forever. Both for ourselves and our changing needs and tastes and for future owners of the home, it’s nice to be able to create a totally different look and feel in the future without having to do major construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s start with the foyer, which is a work in process. I love that when you enter the home, you see the entire floor. The staircase looks so lovely and grand, especially with the black paint and the landing at the bottom of the stairs to emphasize the grandeur of the steps. There was a crazy wood panel fracture with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs but we all thought it was bulky and awkward and it didn&#8217;t seem to be original to the rest of the stairwell. Our architect convinced us (Larry) to get rid of it and our contractor convinced us to rip up that whole wall and expose the brick. I love the sneak peek into the original brick, and how it grounds the space from the frou-frou antique-looking chandelier and the stained glass. I loved using the same ceramic tile from the dining room in the entry vestibule and again—it was all brought together so beautifully by <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">painting</a> all of it black.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like all good Iranians, I made sure the guest room was the first one in the house that was set up, furnished, and made available for use. Guests are sacred in our culture and we started having house guests after the first night in our house, and for about three months straight afterward. I think Larry takes more of an American’s tact towards house guests…like fish, they start to stink after three days. But having them on their own floor with their own bathroom certainly makes it easy to have folks around. Oh, how I love having a guest room. Basically, if you paint any room Benjamin Moore Chelsea Gray, it will be close to perfect. I had a different idea about how this room would look but then I inherited this terrible rug from my father’s house in Tehran and had to redo all the bedding to go with the odd mix of muted colors. I love Persian rugs, don’t get me wrong<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>walking on bare floors isn’t my taste. But we followed the rules for a perfect guest room: make sure the bed is comfy, that the closets are empty so guests can use them for their own stuff, and provide a work desk (so you can hold your best friends hostage for weeks at a time in your home, even if they insist they have to go back to LA to “work”).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This guest bathroom is so delightfully boring that I fall asleep looking at its soothing tones. I wish I pushed harder for <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/10-bathroom-floor-tiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moroccan tiles</a> in here. I think the floors we used, which basically mimic the look and feel of concrete, wash the whole room out. Our architect used these floors in a hotel project and I really dug them; they were cheap and cool, but always remember the scale of a home project versus a commercial project. What may look like a great feature in a larger space may not work in a smaller venue. I usually have a Persian rug down on this floor which gives the room some warmth and life. If you are ever unhappy with the flooring, put a rug on it! I can’t say enough about how much I love these subway tiles though<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>they are just varied enough to give them a real handmade look rather than the flat subway tiles we usually see. They come in a gorgeous gray and black as well<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>I failed in not using them in more spots throughout the house; that may be a future project. I love the shower as well, we made it nice and big so that Nacho could have fun in there. We also built a large bench along it with a grip bar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moms visit often, and I find bathtubs to be really dangerous for the senior citizen crowd. We felt good about having a step-in shower and adding features that would make it safe for both Nacho and the grandmas. It’s lovely having the windows in the bathrooms after years of using interior bathrooms with poor ventilation, though we haven’t figured out a good solution for the wood window trim, which is constantly getting wet and will probably crack or mold in the future. I also highly recommend an integrated sink when you have filthy toddlers—makes clean-up so much easier. This was the top half of a vanity and sink combo I bought. We ended up hating the vanity, so I just had our contractor make us a <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom cabinet</a>, which is lovely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>These homes were stuck in the past until a (long overdue!) home renovation brought each one back to the future</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homeowners who are feeling ambitious and want to take on a home that hasn’t been changed in decades have a unique opportunity. In an older home that’s been given new life, updated features sit alongside quirky and charming details from the past, such as crown molding and arched doorways. This kind of home renovation where the marriage of old meets new provides all the benefits of a modern space while retaining the character that can only come from a place that has a history. Below, three Sweeten homeowners take on the challenge of revamping older homes—and the results are truly magical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25404 size-chrono" title="home renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SWEETEN_Meredith_Apartment-Before-03-723x482.jpg" alt="home renovation" width="723" height="482" /></a><br />

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Meredith’s townhouse</a>, built in 1941</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith set out to find a fixer-upper and fell in love with a two-family brick Tudor townhouse in Kensington that only had one owner since 1941. With good bones and plenty of personality in the form of arched doorways and a 1950s Caloric stove, the home had potential, but it also required intensive repairs. Lead paint, cloth-wrapped aluminum <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-electrical-work-costs/" target="_blank">electrical wiring</a>, and old steel windows all had to go. Meredith found a contractor on Sweeten and started her renovation, focusing on maintaining some of the ‘40s charm while making necessary functional updates. A new kitchen was designed around the old stove, and in keeping with the theme of nostalgia, Meredith installed a salvaged Sub-Zero fridge and vintage enamel sink. The Pepto-Bismol pink bathrooms were redone in a much more tasteful palette of muted blues and received all new fixtures. Upstairs, the renovation included converting the second kitchen into a master bath, building a nursery, and updating the master bedroom and closet. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/color-and-charm-in-a-designers-tudor-townhouse/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of this lovely townhouse.</p>

</a><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Ron’s postwar apartment</a> and home of 40 years</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron lived in his Upper East Side postwar apartment for 40 years before making the decision to renovate. He worked closely with his interior designer, who came to Sweeten to find a contractor to complete their team. The plan consisted of a total gut renovation of the kitchen as well as painting the apartment, stripping and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/wood-flooring-cost-nyc/" target="_blank">refinishing floors</a>, cleaning up the crown molding in the living room, and adding custom millwork to hide old radiator units. He decided against joining the kitchen and living room and instead chose to keep the kitchen enclosed and add finishes that would make it feel larger and brighter. With all new appliances from Thermador, including a refrigerator<strong>, </strong>gas range, hood, and dishwasher, the kitchen got the functional upgrade it desperately needed. Architectural details in the kitchen mixed well with traditional <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/surprising-truth-ikea-vs-custom-cabinets/" target="_blank">custom cabinets</a> and beveled countertops for a refreshed yet classic style. In the living room, custom <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/custom-built-in-bookcase-nyc/" target="_blank">built-ins</a> with ample shelving were built to show off Ron’s collection of art and treasures from around the world. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/an-art-filled-apartment-renovation-40-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see the rest of Ron’s home, including his updated bedroom and bath.</p>

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen years after moving into her Upper East Side apartment, Claudia felt ready to renovate. It had been three decades since the apartment’s last home renovation, which had brought with it dated finishes, carpeting, and boxy built-ins. Claudia wanted to highlight the original bones of the home that had been covered up, reclaim some of the square footage lost to the old built-ins, and install some much-needed electrical outlets. She also ripped up the 30-year-old carpeting, uncovering original parquet floors. The windows in the living room were combined, allowing the space to become flooded with natural light, and the built-in surrounding the fireplace was demolished, revealing a wood-burning hearth. Crown molding was designed and placed along doorways, windows, ceilings, and floors to evoke some of the lost 1920s charm. To brighten up her home, the walls of the apartment were <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/interior-painting-costs/" target="_blank">painted</a> white, replacing the dark green shade that had ruled the living room for decades. </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/uncovering-a-1929-upper-east-side-gem-claudias-sweeten-renovation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see her updated kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>A tasteful and timely makeover for an 875-square-foot coop</h2>
<p>When a job necessitated a move from a Westchester suburb to New York City, Jessica and her husband, David, hoped for a move-in-ready apartment. Relocating is never simple, and undertaking a renovation was not in the plan. But when the search turned up an outdated (but otherwise perfect) Hudson Heights apartment with a show-stopping view of the George Washington Bridge, they knew it was time to find a contractor. See how the couple used artful ideas to maximize storage space, make room for guests, and enlarge a common living area.</p>
<p><span id="more-21812"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21814 size-feature" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07-936x700.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-07" width="936" height="700" /></span></p>
<p>Despite the beautiful bridge view, a renovation was in order: the 875-square-foot apartment was in a co-op building that had been built in 1917, and while parts of the unit had been updated since, Jessica and David had very specific ideas about how to make it work for their family. Some friends, wishing they had used Sweeten themselves, suggested that the duo try out the service. After consulting Sweeten’s<a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/"> Renovation 101 series</a> and perusing the<a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/"> Before &amp; Afters</a> to get a sense of the possibilities, Jessica<a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/7368"> posted their project</a> while the property went into contract. The plans called for the conversion of the dining room into a second bedroom, a completely reworked kitchen, refinished floors and moldings, as well as minor updates in the bathroom. Jessica set up site visits with her Sweeten matches, and ultimately decided on this <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2757">general contractor</a>, who, coincidentally, lived in the sister building next door. (Apparently, his own floor plan was so similar to Jessica and David’s, he told them that working on their place was “like what he always wanted to do to his own apartment!”) They liked that his was a design-build firm, which provides both interior design and general contracting services. As a &#8220;design-conscious builder,&#8221; he could assist them in making design decisions to achieve the bright and modern look they imagined.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21841 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/floorplan-1-723x755.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="755" /></p>
<p>First, they worked together to address the issues in the kitchen. Since the room faced another part of their building, it did not receive much natural light. An earlier attempt (by previous owners) at brightening the space had resulted in an “awful fluorescent yellow” paint on the walls, which clashed with the light tone of the existing wood cabinets and the orange tile on the floor. Aesthetics aside, the kitchen also did not provide enough functional storage: the only wall of cabinets also housed all the appliances. Inside one cabinet, an unmovable gas meter obstructed any usable space, and a steam riser in a corner wasted valuable square footage. The placement of the extra-wide doorway between the kitchen and the old dining room prevented the addition of a parallel wall of cabinets on the other side. And although the existing stove was in good shape, Jessica and David wanted to switch out the other appliances for energy-efficient alternatives.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21818 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-Before-During-01-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>To create better flow and maximize function, the doorway to the living area was narrowed and moved to the side, making way for a full galley kitchen. A dropped ceiling was also raised to maximize vertical storage. All the appliances remained on the original bank of cabinets, so the (newly built) opposite side could be dedicated entirely to storage in the form of drawers, open shelving, a custom niche for spices, as well as a full-height pantry. In the corner where the steam riser stood, the contractor fabricated cabinet panels with a perforated insert to create a more uniform look. Now, the riser is hidden from view, but the narrow vertical space also serves as extra storage for cleaning supplies. Their Sweeten contractor created a similar solution for the gas meter, wrapping custom shelves around the meter so that the inside of the cabinet was not completely wasted. The couple’s desire for a “bright, clean look” was achieved with pure white shaker cabinets, recycled glass countertops in a light beige, and a white farmhouse sink. Jessica was especially excited about adding a scatter of color in the backsplash with Mexican tiles she sourced from Etsy. For the floor, cork tiles were chosen as a sustainable and renewable material that’s both soundproof and mildew-proof.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21823 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-03" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21825 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-06" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21822 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-01-02.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-01-02" width="723" height="1085" /></p>
<p>Next, there came a change in plans. Although the intention was to create a guest bedroom out of the original dining room, Jessica and David quickly realized that they preferred to keep the space open for their own daily use. As a compromise, they built a closet against the new wall separating the dining room and kitchen. This way, a bedroom could be added down the line and it would already have its own closet. For now, they came up with a simple but genius solution for a flexible guest room: their contractor installed a pocket door between the living area and the kitchen, allowing visitors the option of transforming the entire living/dining room into a private suite.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21820 size-chrono" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08-1.gif" alt="SWEETEN_Jessica_Apartment-During-01-08 (1)" width="723" height="482" /></p>
<p>Their general contractor went to work replacing the crumbly moldings and refinishing the worn floors in the new living area, made newly spacious by the removal of original walls that bracketed the formal dining room. Door moldings in the dining room were salvaged as replacement window trim for the living area. While making these repairs, he realized that there was empty space under each window ledge, which could be repurposed as built-in shelving. He also suggested painting the black window frames white to further brighten the space&#8211;a suggestion that Jessica loved. In addition, the couple requested new wooden beams on the ceiling for character—but it turns out they serve a dual purpose. There was a “step” in the ceiling, and the beams placed there helped to conceal the awkward transition where one part of the ceiling was higher than the other. Interestingly, numerous pieces of plywood were joined to fabricate the beam, which is actually hollow. This was both a greener and more affordable solution than procuring a solid piece of wood.</p>

<p>Although the renovation went smoothly for the most part, Jessica and David did run into a few challenges. First—and this is something we at Team Sweeten hear time and time again—they were held up by permits and approvals. To remove the dining room walls, they needed co-op board approval, which took about a month longer than they had anticipated. On another occasion, they were ordered to stop work for a day because of a misunderstanding about some wiring. The super had given the okay to cut old fabric-wrapped wires that were part of an obsolete intercom system, but it turned out that they connected a neighbor’s functioning phone lines! Thankfully, they were able to repair the lines and continue working the next day.</p>
<p>Jessica and David had never renovated in New York City before, and had dozens of questions when they started out. Now that they’ve lived to tell the tale, they have a couple pieces of advice to share with aspiring renovators: “Build in some extra time—everything takes longer than it should!” (That’s why renovators should always build in <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/what-to-know-before-you-change-the-layout-in-your-nyc-co-op-or-condo/">at least two to six months for permits and approvals</a>.) Despite the lengthier-than-anticipated renovation, they are so happy to have a custom-built home that not only suits their every need, but is environmentally friendly and energy efficient to boot!</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Jessica and David, for sharing your beautiful new apartment with us!</p>

Mud was applied to level the surface, in preparation for durable faux wood ceramic planks that butt together with minimal grout, like real timber flooring (read: low maintenance!).</p>
<p>Gutting walls around the room gained a sliver of extra space for counters. Slightly deeper new countertops are white quartz, to bounce light around. Adding a dishwasher cost storage space below the counter, so to compensate for the loss, much taller upper cabinets go right to the ceiling, where oversized crown molding is painted to match the Shaker-inspired doors featuring soft-close.</p>
<p>A drafty-in-winter exhaust fan got nixed to make room for a stainless shelf and compact microwave. Muddy brown backsplashes are replaced with bold teal 1940’s-inspired tile laid like bricks, their white grout highlighting a graphic running-bond layout.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span><strong>:</strong> In a previously overlooked corner, cantilevered shelves offer a hands-off high perch for colorful accessory display.

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here at Sweeten, we understand that pairing the correct architect and client is more than circumstantial, and that the best working relationships are based largely on shared visions and philosophies. This <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/portfolios/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea gut renovation</a> project brought together Sweeten member firm Future Project, co-owned by Pedro Pachano and Ampara Vollert, who specialize in exploring theories of space and sensory discovery in their architecture, with an art collector client who wanted more than just a space to showcase her individual art pieces. The art-loving homeowner was looking for something that would act as a flexible framework for her entire collection and lifestyle.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The apartment&#8217;s original layout was made up of a number of smaller rooms that varied in floor height, which did not allow for two key aspects that the homeowner specified for her remodeled home: to be able to entertain large numbers of people, and to have significant wall space for her collected works.<span id="more-10514"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg" alt="01_living" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/01_living-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By removing a series of interior walls, integrating a diffused lighting system that creates flattering light for the homeowner&#8217;s many dinner parties, and using wide plank, white washed maple flooring and continuous, white walls and surface planes, the renovated apartment can now be experienced as an expansive space that is punctuated with art and views of the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg" alt="02_kitchen-entrance" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/02_kitchen-entrance-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, Pedro and Ampara created a similarly expansive yet more personalized experience by using materials that engage both the senses of vision and touch. Here, custom, white Corian cabinets create uniform planes which are even used to hide the appliances, and a nice plus is that the Corian panels are pleasant to the touch. Knowing the homeowner&#8217;s propensity to entertain, the Future Project team designed a custom cantilevered island. The island is topped with an ocean blue resin surface like the countertop and backsplash which creates visual depth in the space and “relaxes the eye.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10518" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg" alt="03_family" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/03_family-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg" alt="04_family-2" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/04_family-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Discovery&#8221; was a theme Future Project worked with in their design, and we love how they used this idea here in the den area with this unique paneled wall system. The polished Rosewood veneer panels open to reveal a series of interior spaces, each with its own color of polished lacquer paint and unique function. One door leads to a guest bathroom, another to a roll-out closet system, and the one above opens to a colorful custom bar installation by a contemporary artist.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10536" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg" alt="bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s a peek into the guest bath, one of our favorite rooms in the apartment. This space features a custom vanity and shower construction made of grey Corian with mirrored edges which make for a unique, fragmented optical illusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10520" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg" alt="05_master-bath" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/05_master-bath-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The master bathroom is equally blue and oceanic. The walls, floor and ceiling here are tiled in 1&#8243; <a href="https://www.glasstile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanside Tessera glass mosaic tiles</a>, and the vanity is custom in white Thassos marble.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10521" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg" alt="06_bedroom" width="600" height="402" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06_bedroom-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because she entertains so frequently, the homeowner wanted the option of a guest room, but at the same time did not want to give up her home&#8217;s open, gallery-like quality. Pedro and Ampara came up with a smart solution to accommodate both needs with a custom sliding wall (for separation) and second bed that&#8217;s all stored beneath the master bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10522" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png" alt="08_double-wine-hallway" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/08_double-wine-hallway-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As if we needed any further proof, this homeowner&#8217;s wine closet is yet another testament to her hostessing skills &#8212; so, when&#8217;s the next party?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Great work and many thanks to Future Project&#8217;s Pedro and Ampara for sharing their work with us; we look forward to seeing more from these designers, soon!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This week we&#8217;re off to a beach bungalow in the Hamptons to get our last taste of summer and catch up with tS member firm Uli &amp; Associates (formally Fractal Construction). Firm owner and lead architect, Ulises &#8220;Uli&#8221; Liceaga walked us through the recent renovation of his own summer home, this little 800 square foot, 2 bedroom bungalow, which he retrofitted for his family of 7 &#8212; yep, Uli and his wife Christina have 5 kids, all under the age of 8! The family enjoys a particularly active lifestyle; they especially love biking, horseback riding, kitesurfing and wakeboarding, and they spend a lot of time in the Hamptons during the summers. So, a few years ago they purchased their own house at Amagansett&#8217;s Lazy Point, a kitesurfing and windsurfing mecca. While the location was perfect, the house itself was far from it, and Uli immediately got to work designing his family&#8217;s new beach bungalow.<span id="more-9802"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9890" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg" alt="03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_fractal_construction-beach_bungalow-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The before conditions were dark, cramped and outdated, so the main objectives of the renovation were to open up and modernize the space. One of the biggest challenges for the designer was working within the 800 sqft footprint of the original home. Due to building restrictions in the Hamptons it&#8217;s really hard to get approval for exterior changes, which meant that Uli had to figure out how he would accommodate his dynamic family without expanding the size of the home. A second big challenge came when there was a delay in the closing of the house, and they ended up with only a month to do the renovation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen those shows where they renovate a house in a few weeks time, well that&#8217;s what we did. I grabbed a couple of crews and we worked weekends and long days. It took about 21 days. I set up a trailer there, and stayed there. People don&#8217;t believe me when I tell them how long it actually took. When I look back I can&#8217;t believe we did it.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Ulises Liceaga, tS member &amp; owner of Uli and Associates</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9891" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg" alt="02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett" width="600" height="440" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/02_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett1-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once construction started, it quickly became clear that a full-scale gut renovation was necessary, as the house&#8217;s structural shell turned out to be completely rotten. Outside, the original deck was so rotted out that you couldn&#8217;t tell where it began or ended. The local conservation codes also prevented Uli from changing the footprint of the deck in the new design, so, after removing its decayed remnants, the team did their best to reconstruct the deck&#8217;s original form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9808" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg" alt="03_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/03_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside the finished space, the transformation is astounding! We love the exposed cedar framework; Uli effectively modernized the original design by stripping the building down to its most basic form. He then highlighted the rebuilt structure by using simple but beautiful materials and finishes. An additional bonus is that the exposed trusses also make a great place to store the family&#8217;s surf boards! At the back, the all new kitchen features new stainless steel appliances and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">glass door cabinets from Ikea</a>. Other modern furnishings throughout the home are from Room and Board including a desk and <a href="https://www.roomandboard.com/">storage shelves</a> made from reclaimed wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9809" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg" alt="P:1001-516E 89th StreetDrawings2012-02-1082 Shore Drive East" width="620" height="455" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg 620w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett-300x220.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/04_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett-600x440.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a>The new, open floor plan includes intimate sleeping quarters with playful bunk beds for the children and a spacious deck where the family can play and relax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9810" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg" alt="05_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett" width="600" height="502" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/05_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The functional-meets-whimsical design of Uli&#8217;s beach retreat was inspired not only by his unique family, but by the architect&#8217;s belief that successful design is about responding to the needs of modern living. The finished bungalow is indeed modern yet very practical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9811" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg" alt="06_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/06_theSweeten_UliandAssociates-Amagansett-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>We can&#8217;t imagine a better place to spend this Labor Day, have a fun and safe weekend!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Uli &amp; Associates for sharing this beautiful transformation, and congratulations on a difficult job well done! Thanks also to photographer Jacob Sadrak for sharing these beautiful photos.</p>

Today we have before &amp; afters of the transformed kitchen, along with Lisa&#8217;s insightful narrative on the new design and the process of making it happen.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9736 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="256" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/00b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-copy-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before renovating, our kitchen had its original, 1960s pine cabinets that were custom-built for the space, but had many layers of bad paint jobs and several of the doors didn&#8217;t close. We thought about trying to save them, but they were so solidly built that there was no way to cut them down to fit our new design plan. Plus, stripping all that paint off would have been a nightmare. The vinyl flooring was peeling, the wall oven didn&#8217;t work, the cooktop was barely functional and it was almost impossible to see what you were cooking since it was stuck in a corner under a metal hood. The countertops were horrible, fake woodgrain formica. When we first moved in, they were even worse &#8212; there was contact paper on them, which we were able to pull up, but we were disappointed with what we uncovered!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We needed a gut renovation! Everything had to go, down to the studs, which meant new drywall, ceilings, cabinets, fixtures, appliances, flooring, backsplash and lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9662 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01a_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about Sweeten a while ago in NYMag and kept it in the back of my mind because I knew we were going to renovate our kitchen. Although I worked in the interior design field, most of the contractors I knew were doing high-end renovations in Manhattan. I posted before pictures of my kitchen on the site and Sweeten introduced me via email to three contractors, all of whom I met with and who gave me estimates. They all seemed good, but as someone who knows about renovation, I appreciated that our contractor took extra time to really look at the kitchen, open up the cabinets, anticipate potential problems, and talk in depth about the process.<span id="more-9660"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9663 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png" alt="brooklyn heights kitchen renovation" width="600" height="904" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen.png 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-199x300.png 199w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/01b_theSweeten_NKCI-KensingtonKitchen-597x900.png 597w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Design / Style</strong></span></em>: Having worked as a design assistant for an architectural interior design firm, I got to see a lot of custom kitchens being made, usually with white millwork and cabinetry, which I really like &#8211; it&#8217;s clean and timeless.  I learned about a lot of interesting materials and fixtures, too, and my style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and contemporary &#8212; definitely not ultra-modern.  Even though the building was built in 1961, the apartment has some nice, almost mid-century modern, details: a curved hallway soffit, hardwood floors, baseboard moldings, and a really neat custom pantry closet with separate compartments.  I wanted the kitchen to fit the era of the apartment and the building, but still be updated. I knew that I wanted high gloss, white cabinets and appliances in order to create a feeling of space, plus they are so much easier to clean.  The kitchen is small, so having simple lines and using materials in a way that make the space feel bigger were key factors in the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m not afraid of dark or saturated colors, but you have to know how to use them. Using the dark navy color on the back wall was yet another way to create the illusion of space by making that wall disappear, or recede, into the background.  You also need to consider the light in the space when choosing a wall color, and sometimes the right color can be almost counter-intuitive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s always difficult to do a gut renovation in an apartment. Living in a construction zone is messy and stressful, although Nick&#8217;s team did their best to keep the dust and debris to a minimum.  Of course, budget was a challenge. You have to think about what to spend your money on to get the most bang for your buck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Flooring</strong></span></em>: I was so tempted to spend a lot on the flooring, but in a small space, it&#8217;s often not really worth it.  I decided on porcelain tile because of price point and durability, but finding one was tricky; there weren&#8217;t a lot of color options that would compliment my countertops, which I had already picked out. I finally found an Italian porcelain, which wasn&#8217;t expensive; I used a big 12&#8243; x 24&#8243; tile in a staggered brick pattern laid horizontally to give the illusion of width.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Cabinets</strong></span></em>: I knew that I wanted to buy the cabinets from Ikea, which is a great, budget-friendly, option. They are really well-made &#8212; much better than cabinets from the big box stores and even sometimes better than the ones you can get from custom cabinet dealers. Planning a kitchen from scratch is a challenge, and if you are buying cabinets from Ikea, you really need to have a good idea of what you want before you order, especially since the cabinets only come in a limited range of sizes. The designers there are helpful, but only up to a certain point. I had to think a lot about the functionality of the space, the flow, and the most efficient way to store everything. It helps to have a contractor who has installed Ikea cabinets before, and Nick knew what to expect. Nick was also great at coming up with custom solutions &#8212; when the new cabinets didn&#8217;t fit exactly how we wanted them, he created a modified, open cabinet so that we would still get the added storage. He also built a very sleek, custom radiator cover which can be easily removed to get to the radiator, if necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span></em>: Because it&#8217;s a small kitchen, I also needed to think about things like appliance door clearance &#8212; we wanted an integrated dishwasher next to the sink, and had to figure out where was best to install it in order to keep from disrupting the flow in the kitchen. Even figuring out which way the cabinet doors would open was important to plan out ahead of time.  Finding a counter-depth, 32&#8243; wide refrigerator in a smooth white finish was also a challenge. Europeans have the leg up on American manufacturers when it comes to smaller, apartment size appliances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I love my new kitchen!  Although I had picked every element of the new kitchen, I was concerned that the finished whole was not going to be equivalent to the sum of all the parts; would it work cohesively in the end?  There were a few stressful times, and I did have to make some quick decisions that could have gone awry, but ultimately, I set out to achieve some major objectives and I believe I more than met them all.  I have more cabinet space, more countertop space, larger appliances, it feels much more modern and homey, and it was done in a fairly budget- and time-conscious way.  In fact, my kitchen now makes the rest of my apartment now look pretty shabby!<span id="more-9437"></span></p>

<p><strong>The Budget</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I generally stayed within budget.  As I said, it was a &#8220;renovation-on-a-budget.&#8221; I had originally planned to spend $6,000, which increased to $9,000 when I decided to replace my appliances.  In the end, I hit almost $11,000, but that was because of a couple of “extras” that I did not account for – delivery charges, taxes, etc. I also asked Peter to install some new medicine cabinets in my bathroom. Renovations can be addicting, I just did not want to stop!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>30 Days After</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For me, the hardest part of having a new kitchen was figuring out where everything goes afterwards. I suppose in hindsight, I should have planned where my dishes, silverware, cleaning supplies, pantry items, etc, would be kept. My objective was just to maximize storage efficiently, as best I could, but I didn’t actually think about which cabinets would store which items!  Lucky for me, I put in enough drawers and cabinets that I just about found a place for everything. Minus a few tall items, like my Swiffer.  Oops – note to self for next time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve also put my kitchen through a few test runs at this point, having hosted two dinner parties already, one for my family (party of 7) and one for a few girlfriends (party of 4).  The new arrangement deftly allowed my fiancé and I to cook and clean together, with minimal fuss.  My kitchen report card after 30 days?  I still heart it – it’s so bright and clean and modern, I&#8217;m 100% glad I did it!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first moved into my apartment a year ago, I knew I wanted to renovate the kitchen.  I wouldn’t say the place is a fixer upper, but the kitchen was dated – the appliances were all too small, the backsplash was an awful, murky green tile, and the cabinets were too high and just did not provide enough efficient storage.  There was also a big hole in the wall right underneath the sink that I totally missed prior to moving in. With the costs of buying my first home, renovating wasn’t something I could take on immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This summer, however, my fiancé is moving in. So, after a year of living with a less than optimal kitchen, I did a bit of financial planning and I decided to bite the bullet and take the leap to do a renovation-on-a-budget.<span id="more-9349"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="white-cabinets-black-floor-before-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48016 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg" alt="small kitchen with white cabinets and square backsplash tiles and black floor before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-Before-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Planning Process </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started planning in early April, starting with where I would purchase my kitchen (easy, Ikea), whether I would replace my appliances (initially no, but then decided it would be better from a resale perspective to have “larger” appliances), and how I would find a contractor (um, who knew?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kitchen Cabinets</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I planned a day out to Brooklyn Ikea with my fiancé, sister, and friend, mostly for moral support, but also because who doesn’t like to spend a day hanging out in Ikea?  I had at that point pored through the catalogue and had a general idea of what I wanted, which ended up being what I chose: <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKURUM in Lidi White</a>. While at Ikea, I learned more about the planning services they offer, and I was happy to pay $99 for someone to come over and measure my kitchen and upload the specifications into the Ikea Kitchen Planner (more on how this worked out below) before I started playing pretend architect and interior designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Appliances</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I decided to replace my 20 inch range with a 24 inch range, my small white refrigerator with a shiny new LG “skinny” fridge, keep my 17 inch wide dishwasher because I had never actually used it, and install a range hood (even though it wouldn’t vent outside, I thought it must help somewhat to circulate the air above the cooktop).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractors</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I spoke with 5 contractors, each of whom I found via a different source.  The first was through Ikea’s primary contractor, which was the company that came to measure my kitchen.  The second, I found while trolling through ikeafans.com.  The third was an independent contractor, introduced to me through a friend.  The fourth was a contact of my mother’s.  The last was through a submission to Sweeten, which I had read about in a blog post on Apartment Therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, I made the decision to go with #5, Peter Ramirez of NYC Pros, who I was matched to by theSweeten.  Peter was professional, thorough, and committed to staying within our agreed upon budget.  He even sat down with me prior to my big purchase at Ikea just to make sure I didn’t miss minor things like toe kicks and hinges and the like.  As we all know, going to Ikea for small items is a big pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Countertops, Flooring and Backsplash</strong></span> &#8211; </i>I also ended up going through Peter’s contact for my countertops. It was something I had not originally planned for, but I am glad I decided to go with quartz as opposed to the laminate that Ikea sells. It took me two trips to Williamsburg and a comparison trip to Home Depot, but I now have amazing gray stone countertops that really lift the whole look and feel of the kitchen, I love it. My backsplash and floor tiles were a simple purchase made on homedepot.com, since I already had an idea of what I wanted – gray stone-like laminate tiles and a clear glass backsplash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="demolished-kitchen-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48014 mb-48" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg" alt="demolished kitchen with only sink remaining during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lisa-GuestPost-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Renovation Process</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All I have to say is that your choice in contractor drives your overall experience, because you must trust that things will get done according to your expectations from a quality and time-frame perspective. We started the renovation on May 7<sup>th</sup>, a day after I had originally planned, because yours truly took longer to get all the paperwork submitted to the coop board than expected.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 1 was demolition and putting in the new floors.</li>
<li>Day 2 was repairing the (gross) walls post demolition.</li>
<li>Days 3 and 4 were installing the base cabinets, which required cutting into wall.  Regardless of the exact measurements and careful layout on the Ikea Kitchen Planner, one lesson learned is that in reality, not everything will fit perfectly.  End of the weekend brought the countertop templating as well.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Day 5 was wall cabinet installation.</li>
<li>Day 6 was installing appliances.</li>
<li>Day 7 was plaster and painting.  Day 7 was also supposed to be countertop installation day but our guy ended up with a burst eye artery!  So off to the hospital and for some much needed rest he went.</li>
<li>Day 8 became new countertop day, with some backsplash installation.</li>
<li>Day 9 wrapped up the backsplash and cleanup. Yes, the total renovation was only 9 days! I suppose when you have a small kitchen, it is totally doable.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the process, my fiancé and I were in and out of the apartment about once every other day, just to check out the progress and to make some executive decisions, like how high the backsplash was going to extend.  I feel like I got really lucky with the entire renovation. Not only was everything done on time, which I have heard almost never happens, but it was really pretty painless. In fact, by the time Peter and his team left, it was somewhat bittersweet, I was all done!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;We are ultimately focused on the tangible components and how they contribute to the experience of a project, which allows conceptual designs to be realized within actual parameters of budget and resources.&#8221;</h2>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8211;Bryan Young, Principal at Young Projects</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This week, we&#8217;re pleased to introduce one of theSweeten&#8217;s newest members, DUMBO-based architecture studio, Young Projects. Firm principal Bryan Young (photographed above) launched his practice in 2010, and in just 3 years, the small team has rallied some big achievements, including last month&#8217;s award of the <a href="https://archleague.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 Architectural League Prize</a>. In practice, the team pursues unique considerations of materiality, assembly, &amp; craft through a method of experimentation that embraces all levels of technology; the resulting architecture, while stylistically modern, elicits qualities of warmth &amp; tactility. We were interested in learning more about Young Projects&#8217; work, so we met up with Bryan on the site of a project that is currently under construction in Williamsburg, the <a href="https://sweeten.com/portfolios/Gut-Renovation/Photographer-s-Townhouse-Williamsburg-Brooklyn-NY/602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="graphic-rendering-of-two-storey-house"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48042 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg" alt="3d graphic rendering of a two storey house backyard with swimming pool before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-5-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Photographer&#8217;s Townhouse project is a gut renovation &amp; new addition to an existing, 2,300 sqft masonry townhouse. The century-old building had deteriorated to a state of disrepair before it was purchased by a local photographer. After a thoughtful collaboration between the Young Projects team and the homeowner, the first phase of construction began earlier this year. On site, Bryan walked us through some of the highlights of the project design and development. One of the most prominent features of the new design is the exterior; by their use of materials, the designers have created a strong juxaposition between the old, restored brick facade, and the new addition &#8212; an elevated mass behind a screen of perforated, corrugated zinc. You can see the exterior in the above rendering.<span id="more-8739"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="2d-design-rendering"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48038" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg" alt="2d design rendering of a two storey-house" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This section drawing gave us an idea of the proposed interior space. Unlike the sharp contrast on the exterior, the distinction between old and new is more subtle on the interior &#8212; a &#8216;conceptual fault line&#8217; creates a slip in the floor level at the intersection of the old &amp; new zones. On a functional level, by elevating the addition, the designers provide space for parking. With this arrangement, the back yard is replaced by a series of rooftop courtyards that will allow the perfect amount of privacy on the corner lot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="room-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48041 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg" alt="photo of a room with beams during renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-4-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, on site, we&#8217;re standing near the center of the old townhouse looking toward the back where the new addition will be constructed. A large portion of the ceiling overhead will be opened up for a glimpse at one of the landscaped courtyards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="design-illustration-of-dining-living-rooms"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48039 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2.jpg" alt="3d graphic rendering of open dining and living rooms before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This rendering is what we would see from where we&#8217;re standing in the photo above. Here you can see the changes in the floor height, indicating where the new addition begins. Opposite what we saw on the exterior, the designers have created continuity across the slip with the conscious use of materials, so that on the interior, we read the old &amp; new as a fluid space.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="townhouse-exterior-during-renovation"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48044 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg" alt="three storey townhouse exterior during renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-7-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the old masonry building, the construction crew started prepping the foundation for the new addition. Construction here will take some time, but we&#8217;re excited to follow along as the new home takes shape!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, we thought we&#8217;d head over to the Young Projects studio in DUMBO to check out what else the designers are up to &#8212; what we found really highlighted how adaptable the Young Projects approach is for meeting different types of design challenges.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole team was hard at work when we arrived at their sunny loft office! The space was filled with material samples, models, mock-ups, sketches, experiments and printouts, showcasing their iterative design process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="various-graphic-rendering-images"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48043 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6.jpg" alt="four different graphic rendering images of two storey house and plywood before renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-6-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were drawn to a large site model and renderings along one wall in the space, which Bryan explained are from a project that will move to construction later this year, the Playa Grande Retreat. The retreat will be the vacation home for a NYC-based family, with a program that includes a main house, 3 guest bungalows and a kiva for special events, all on a 6.5 acre beachfront site in the Dominican jungle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" title="graphic-rendering-of-two-storey-house"  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48045 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8.jpg" alt="3d backyard design illustration of a two storey house before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/YoungProjects-Williamsburg-8-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rendering above shows a view from a path leading to the main house. The designers followed to the natural topography and landscape of the site in order to generate forms, structure &amp; pathways, as well as experiences of the site &amp; views.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Directed by solar orientation, natural ventilation and the desire to preserve all existing trees and vegetation, the evolved form is a drifting ring that shifts in plan and section just below the jungle’s canopy. The roof is a ruled surface requiring over 200 scissor trusses; each is dimensionally unique, but simple in joinery and construction.&#8221;</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The indoor / outdoor structure will be a fantastic place to enjoy nature and host friends &amp; family. We look forward to seeing the construction unfold and forms come to life!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you could give your home a whole new character, imbue it with the essence of a place you love, near or far? That&#8217;s just what Kyle &amp; Sophia had in mind for their home in Lincoln Square. After living for a while in California, the busy young professionals were inspired to bring some of that West Coast sensibility to their current home in NYC &#8212; a 685 sqft, 1-bedroom apartment overlooking the Lincoln Center. The homeowners were lucky to meet fellow California ex-pat, Sarah Zames of the firm General Assembly, who worked with them to re-imagine the cramped and outdated space. After nailing down new designs for the kitchen, master bath &amp; powder room, Sarah suggested using Sweeten, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors, to find the right contractor for the job. After meeting their matches, the designer &amp; homeowners chose to work a <a href="https://sweeten.com/site-visit/closet-wine-bar-renovation-nyc/">Sweeten general contractor</a>. The renovated home is light, airy, &amp; nature-inspired; it&#8217;s a perfect place to relax and enjoy the view!</p>
