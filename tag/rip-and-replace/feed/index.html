<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After four years in their apartment in the Clinton Hill Co-ops Rita and Mark decided to renovate their kitchen (and </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/crisp-white-bathroom-clinton-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). They weren’t sold on the kitchen’s footprint (due to the limited countertop and cabinet space) and debated whether or not to reimagine how everything was laid out. The couple also needed additional electric outlets—a common ask in older buildings. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/26983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted their project to Sweeten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and received matches that best aligned with their scope of work and budget. Rita and Mark </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose a general contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and got started on the renovation.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-38760 size-full" title="oak-cabinets-white-appliances-before-renovation" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg" alt="oak kitchen cabinets and square tiles on floor and white walls and white appliances before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SWEETEN-Rita-Nannini-KitchenBath-Before-02-723x482.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>After</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ultimately the renovators decided to stick with the existing layout and focus on other high-impact details, like cabinetry, countertops, and a backsplash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita and Mark wanted mid-range cabinets, and finding the right style and price-point, at first, proved challenging. “There are many high-end cabinet makers and many low-end ones,” Rita said. They ended up going with Cliq Studios, who they worked with via email and on the phone. The dark wood cabinets they selected are classic and provide contrast to the bright white countertops and tile backsplash.</span></p>

It’s also our food-serving island when we entertain,” Rita shared. This gave them new workspace, without the hassle or expense of overhauling the layout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their contractor took the initiative throughout the project to tackle any budding issues head-on. Since the homeowners weren’t living in the apartment during the remodel either, his team coordinated all the deliveries to ensure they’d stay on track with timing. Not to mention, their contractor and team had a lot of experience <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with co-ops</a> which made this renovation move all the more smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Project</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Update old appliances, cabinetry, and fixtures</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Before</strong></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sheryl lived in her Woodside, Queens co-op for over 15 years. She plans to stay in the apartment (originally built in 1935 as part of the New Deal initiative) for years to come and wanted to make her kitchen suited for the long haul. “I made the decision to renovate because I want to age-in-place in this home and felt now would be the best time to do it,” she shared. Since she was on board with the layout, Sheryl’s goal was to refresh everything else and add a dishwasher, which would be a first for her. After </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/24127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posting the project </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(which also included </span><a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/neutral-bathrooms-spotlight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">her bathroom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to Sweeten, she was matched with three Sweeten general contractors. They all provided estimates, visited her home, and then she </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose the contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that felt like the best fit.</span></p>

Sheryl opted for a neutral palette with light gray cabinets and all stainless steel appliances. She added a slight pop of color and pattern in the backsplash with a row of light blue floral accent tiles. The stainless apron-front sink is deep and wide, perfect for watering plants or soaking dishes—though the new dishwasher can also take care of that.</span></p>

They ended up finding almost everything for the kitchen at one local supplier, which made it convenient for her. The process also helped offset the stress of living in the apartment during the renovation with her cat Lexie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with the work. It was exact, professional and beautifully done,” Sheryl said.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade a full bath and powder room</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Saira and her husband purchased their East Village duplex with the intention to renovate before moving in. “The two most urgent spaces were the bathrooms,” she said. “They were just very old.” Their style is very clean, minimal, and modern—everything the existing spaces were not. With two young kids, the couple was also worried about having only one full bathroom, which made it even more important to have the spaces updated with new fixtures and better storage options. Equipped with Saira’s Pinterest board for inspiration, they <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/30368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted their project to Sweeten</a> and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were matched with a general contractor</a>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: With a clear vision in mind, Saira worked with her Sweeten general contractor to bring it to life. The bathrooms share a black-and-white palette and many of the same materials, like the floating wood shelves and industrial light fixtures (which match others throughout the apartment). “I love the contrast of the white tiles with the matte black hardware,” Saira said. They opted for a pedestal sink in the powder room to save on space.</p>
<p>Keeping the design really simple visually and functionally was very important—especially for their children’s safety and their own sanity. The floating vanity in the full bathroom is easier to clean and has just enough room under it for the kids’ step stools, too. “We were very mindful of certain things, like making sure the tile was easy to clean and not too slippery,” Saira said. Their contractor helped pull materials using Saira’s Pinterest board and the couple’s budget as guidelines.</p>

<p>For the most part, Saira communicated with the contracting team via email, receiving pictures of the progress throughout the process. “Our general contractor was always willing to meet at times that were convenient to us,” she said. Fortunately, the project stayed on schedule so the family didn’t have to renew their lease and stay in their rental.</p>
<p>Saira’s parents actually own a real estate business in Toronto, so while she does have remodeling experience, this was her first time doing so in New York City. “Everyone always says renovating is a nightmare, but if you find the right general contractor and you have a good relationship, it can be pretty fun,” she shared.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The family also had the entire apartment repainted, the floors refinished, and a new closet built by their Sweeten general contractor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>One kitchen and two bathrooms get a fresh start</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If there&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve learned in seeing thousands of renovations, it&#8217;s not the size of the remodel that matters; it&#8217;s how closely you pay attention to the details. Thoughtful and careful consideration of the materials and finishes used in a space can have a huge impact. Read on for three Sweeten homeowners who took their small spaces to the next level.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Project</strong></strong></span>: Revive a tired bathroom</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Location</strong></strong></span>: Prospect Heights, Brooklyn</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><strong>Before</strong></strong></span>: </span>When the sink cracked in this homeowner’s outdated bathroom, it got her thinking about the rest of the space. She <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/21812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Planning on keeping the plumbing intact, her to-do list included swapping out the tile, wallpaper, vanity, and lighting fixtures, in addition to reglazing the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" title="beige-white-bathroom-with-vanity" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48980 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg" alt="Beige and white bathroom with vanity and sink and green wallpaper before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Carly-Bathroom-Before-01-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong><strong>After</strong></strong>:</span>White subway tile paired with a marble hex floor tile increased the brightness tenfold. A brand new sink (free of cracks) and simple white vanity replace the old set while <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-lighting-guide-types-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-century modern sconces</a> flank the mirror. This clean and crisp makeover makes it hard for us to believe that we&#8217;re looking at the same bathroom from the &#8220;before&#8221; photos!</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: A rip-and-replace opens up a kitchen</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Murray Hill, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: </span>This homeowner&#8217;s newly purchased apartment was in great condition but the kitchen needed some work, so he posted his <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/22451" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project on Sweeten</a> and was matched with <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. Aiming to create an open kitchen with clean lines, the focus was placed on knocking down walls, redoing cabinets and countertops, installing new appliances, and replacing the flooring.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="brown-kitchen-island-bar-stools" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48986 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1.jpg" alt="Brown kitchen island and bar stools along with brown kitchen cabinets before renovation" width="1000" height="667" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Anish-LivingRoom-Before-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>Glossy white upper cabinets are balanced by espresso wood-grain cabinets along the bottom, providing a sharp (and welcome!) contrast to the bland wood tone cabinets from before. Under-cabinet lighting boosts the overall brightness, reflecting off the bright white backsplash and countertops. The muted walls—painted in an almost buttercream shade—and <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/choose-best-kitchen-floor-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blonde hardwood floors</a> add just the right amount of warmth.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Upgrade an outdated bathroom</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location</strong></span>: Washington Heights, Manhattan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: This postwar apartment had good bones but was borderline decrepit when the homeowner purchased it. Ready to gut-renovate, she <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/5333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted her project</a> on Sweeten and found <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Sweeten architect</a>. One of the rooms that needed a complete overhaul was the bathroom. Her plan: combine clean lines and useful storage with touches of vintage modern style (which may sound like an oxymoron but happens to be a real thing—it’s a combo of old-school style meets modern simplicity).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong>: </span>New fixtures and a <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/bathroom-storage-every-nook-cranny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">double-wide medicine cabinet</a> bring a much-needed functional upgrade. The slim profile of a pedestal sink takes up little floor space, allowing the opposite wall to take on extra storage in the form of open shelves and a spot for a hamper. A glass shower partition—as opposed to a shower curtain—improves the flow of light and helps make </span>the space<span style="color: #000000;"> feel bigger.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Give a functional kitchen a small facelift in the Upper West Side</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Melissa bought her Upper West Side 650-square-feet condo in 2015 from a family of four, who utilized the space differently than she does as a single homeowner. A big plus of the purchase was that the space only needed some “finishing touches rather than a major reconfiguration.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-Before-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34388 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-Before-06-723x933.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="933" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the kitchen was serviceable, she felt some of the cost-cutting measures made in a prior renovation just didn’t measure up. “I loved the open-concept of my kitchen and how it flowed out to the rest of the space,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but it was clear they skimped on the details.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Melissa hated the existing countertops (“the counter was cheap dark wood with many seams!”), and the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-cabinets-in-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabinets</a> without a toe-kick accumulated a ton of food debris, creating a cleaning nightmare. The bar needed tweaking; it was two different pieces with different depths. The space was much darker than she wanted, getting only morning sunlight, and the wood countertops didn’t help. “They swallowed the room whole!” she noted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it her own, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/27675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she posted her project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweeten</a>, a free service that connects homeowners with vetted general contractors, and <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3191" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selected this Sweeten contractor</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Smart, small changes transformed Melissa’s blah kitchen into a place she’s proud to call home. She replaced the dark wood <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/product-101/primer-kitchen-countertops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countertops</a> with quartz (“so easy to clean and visually opened up my space!”). The bar was not standard height, and so it required custom carpentry to finish it off properly. Adding a white subway tile backsplash and switching out the existing hardware for a larger size instantly improved the space. “I selected modern handles and knobs that accented the tall cabinets and gave the space more function as well as a polished look,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I saw many examples on Sweeten’s blog, which gave me the confidence to go for it!”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34380 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-01-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34383 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But her favorite swap? Her single huge basin sink, that came with various add-ons, has been the game-changer. “It has a removable dish rack that inserts into the sink, which I use every day because it frees up counter space; perfect for small spaces!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Melissa said, “I used Sweeten&#8217;s Client Services to vet unfamiliar questions that popped up, such as buying a counter through a wholesaler so I could resolve my questions quickly.&#8221; Her contractor completed the project on time and on budget. Now, she’s thrilled with the final result. “I love the new bright look and functionality!”</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-07.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34384 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-07-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-34381 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SWEETEN-Melissa-Horn-Kitchen-02-723x482.jpg" alt="kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: Melissa finished her renovation on a tight budget and armed with her helpful dad. They painted the space to make it brighter and <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/repair-protect-wood-floors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced the floors</a> themselves, which saved money. “Let’s just say it was an adventure and I’m glad I didn’t get evicted,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but a little paint and nicer floors went a long way!&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project</strong></span>: Renovate and open up a kitchen in a Ditmas Park, Brooklyn co-op</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before</strong></span>: Lindsay, a director at Brooks Brothers, and Roger, a director in pre-sales at StyleLabs, purchased their 1,075-square-foot, two-bedroom co-op in 2016. Roger “loves to play around in the kitchen,” said his wife, Lindsay. While the kitchen was dark, outdated, and not very functional, the space also didn&#8217;t offer a clear sight line between the kitchen and living room. “We wanted a more family-friendly space, opened up so whoever was in the kitchen could interact with family and friends in the living room,&#8221; they said. &#8220;And we wanted some kind of island/breakfast bar.” After living in the co-op for about a year, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/23235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they posted their project</a> to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, and planned a renewed flow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32796 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After</strong></span>: Lindsay was about nine months pregnant during the renovation, something she wouldn’t recommend to anyone doing a remodel. “The challenge of trying to get around the apartment that was in complete disrepair was interesting on some days,” she said. “We ended up moving the entire kitchen and living room into the nursery. I’d recommend going on a vacation or taking a long weekend trip during the major part of the construction. You think you can live through it for a week or two, and then realize how long a week or two really is. It would have been a nice break to go somewhere where there wasn’t dust and tools and boxes everywhere.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32801 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen02-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/4044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their Sweeten contractor</a> “knew we wanted to get everything done in time for the baby to come<span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span>with a little bit of time to spare to clean up the nursery,” Lindsay said. “They were good at communicating what the status was, how long something was going to take, and how much time we had to make a decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-33272 mb-24" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-3-1-723x482.jpg" alt="Before-3" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-chrono wp-image-32806" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen07-723x482.jpg" alt="SWEETEN LindsayConnolly Kitchen07" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job was basically a “rip-and-replace” with a new peninsula where the wall between the kitchen and living space once stood. The only appliance that moved was the refrigerator, which stayed on the same wall. For the cabinets, their contractor recommended <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a kitchen designer in the Sweeten network</a>. The kitchen designers provided the initial custom cabinet layout, then Lindsay visualized the usability of the kitchen. “I mapped all of our stuff from pantry and appliances to a drawer or cabinet. Then I was able to work with our contractor to determine the best shelf or drawer configuration to utilize the space and fit our stuff,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32807 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen08-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32812 mb-0 size-chrono" title="light-brown-cabinets-white-quartz-counter" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen13.gif" alt="light brown wooden cabinets and white quartz counter and gray walls after renovation " width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The duo chose an island/breakfast bar so guests would feel like a part of the cooking process. Tall cabinets like the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/kitchen-pantry-5-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pantry</a> gave them more storage with pull-out drawers for easy access and a large drawer for their spices. A separate small counter and shelves stand in as their “coffee bar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the difficulties of being pregnant and having to move things during the renovation, Lindsay felt it would have been easier had they spent more time deciding on appliances in advance and budgeting in the little things like cabinet hardware, lighting, faucet, and sink. “You’ve got to be flexible and open-minded to extending your timeline if something is not available immediately, or finding a substitute material.” She also would have raised her <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/cost-guides/nyc-kitchen-renovation-costs-budget-breakdown-for-a-typical-kitchen-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost expectations</a> another $5,000 to $10,000. “There’s always something you forget or didn’t know you had to pay for, like licensing fees just to get co-op approval.” (See Bonus section below.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32797 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Before-2-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32803 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen04-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32810 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen11-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsay cautions other first-timers to be prepared to pay a fee to show a copy of a license for plumbers and electricians, a fee for an engineer to review the design, and a fee for the management company and/or board to review and approve. There were several back-and-forth discussions to get the paperwork exactly right for the approval. “It took us six to eight weeks to get everything in order and get the final approvals,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the bumps, Lindsay and Roger—and now Porter, born in January just after the project was finished—are delighted to be able to entertain family and friends from their new, open kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-32800 mb-0 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SWEETEN-LindsayConnolly-Kitchen01-1-723x482.jpg" alt="rip-and-replace kitchen renovation" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bonus</strong></span>: The couple had actually posted this project on Sweeten twice. There were “politics,” Lindsay said, in getting it approved through the co-op. “We thought we could just submit the design and it would be approved,” she said. “The <a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/reno-101/renovating-heres-navigate-co-op-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approval process</a> for our co-op board was multi-level, which we didn’t understand when we first posted.”</p>
<p>They removed their posting and Sweeten’s client services helped Lindsay rewrite it and narrow down the choices while they searched for a contractor match. Once they found a potential match, several other factors were required by the board, and their contractors “took the time to go through the copy of the board requirements before we officially selected them,” Lindsay said. “As a first-time renovator and co-op owner, we were happy to have a little guidance from someone who has been through this process before.” <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

			<h2>Make it easier for a co-op board to approve your home renovation with a few key steps</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-22518 size-chrono" title="co-op boards" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01_300-Riverside_3-723x481.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="481" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-op buildings have unique ownership structures. C-op owners technically lease the space an apartment occupies. A co-op board, and its representative, the management company, have power over any renovations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’d like to do. Because the board’s role is to protect the interests of all of the owners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the process is less in your control than you&#8217;d think. However, by following a few key practices, you can put your co-op board at ease for your desired remodel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Simple renovations may not need co-op board approval</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most basic work done in kitchens and bathrooms is known as “rip and replace.” This work includes updating finishes, replacing porcelain plumbing fixtures, and upgrading appliances in their existing locations. For this, your building may not demand a permit; saving you money, time, and general red tape.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How your building will evaluate your plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your building is likely to use its own architect to evaluate any renovation plans you submit. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his process is known as an alteration review.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Expect to pay for this service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, typically in the $1,000-$2,000 range</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The architect may flag aspects of the design which seem only tangentially related to your renovation objectives </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e.g., relocating the intercom). As a result,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> communications can drag on for months. However, the principal concerns of this review will not be aesthetic. Rather, the building architect is charged with protecting the building from liability, plus advising the board about building code requirements. Overall dimensions of rooms, and door openings, may need to be enlarged as part of gut renovations. In other cases, wet areas, like bathrooms and kitchens, may be required to stay within the pre-renovation footprint. This requirement is also known as “wet over wet.” These rules act to protect a downstairs neighbor from flooding after a bathroom upstairs is enlarged over, say, a bed. Also remember that with new plumbing, the building may also require you to replace branch lines all the way back to the main water lines. This may result in additional demolition and expenses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Bring in your own architect</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For larger jobs, you’ll need your own architect or engineer. Some offer advice on style and design at a premium price. Others will produce a basic set of drawings that can be submitted to the co-op board or management. They may also file renovation plans with the city, in a service known as “architect of record” and “expediter.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Larger renovations requiring a city permit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A permit for a larger co-op renovation can sometimes be a judgment call. In extreme cases, your board may decide to make you file for one after work has begun. (Be aware: this can possibly result in fines and other city penalties!) The city will also require you to produce a certificate documenting asbestos tests for areas of the apartment that will be demolished. Asbestos can be found in many places: in plaster or joint compound, in caulking, in linoleum flooring, or even impregnated in the underlayment for wood floors. Should asbestos be present, you will be asked to plan for removal by specialists, or encapsulation. The latter is usually cheaper, leaving asbestos undisturbed and adding new finishes on top, when space and aesthetic considerations allow this.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Legal considerations &amp; co-op rules</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op board or building likely has already published and distributed alteration terms or as “house rules,” which should be reviewed closely. They often cover things like requirements for working hours, deliveries, and protections mandated for common areas during debris removal. Even in jobs that do not require permits, you will want to provide management with a written scope of work, listing the various upgrades you propose and requesting written permission—at least over email—to proceed.</span></p>
<h3>What is an alternation agreement?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit your plans,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-op board may ask you to sign an “alteration agreement.” This alteration agreement can include provisions tailored to your particular job. It is not uncommon, especially in blue-chip buildings, for these agreements to encompass punitive regulations. Provisions like time limits for renovations, and daily penalties imposed when jobs are not completed as requested by the co-op board, are not uncommon. These agreements may also<span>—not surprisingly—</span>seek to shift liability for construction to the apartment owner. In cases of particularly punitive agreements, however, you may choose to engage a tenant’s lawyer to negotiate more favorable terms with the building’s legal representative. Typically, you will need to acknowledge the agreement in exchange for the co-op board’s or management company’s signature on your building permit application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding problems in a co-op renovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proprietary lease may allow inspections, so the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">building architect or superintendent may ask</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a look around your apartment, should any questions arise about your proposed renovations or even work underway. For this reason, it is worth keeping the apartment clean and tidy, whether you are living there through the renovation, or not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An environmental testing firm may visit the apartment to monitor lead levels as part of a regular inspection. (This is most likely if your building has a history of lead.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don&#8217;t panic—especially if you have an advance warning. State environmental agencies recommend cleaning with a HEPA vacuum for soft surfaces, or soapy water and paper towels for hard surfaces.</span></p>
<h3>Managing relationships with your co-op board</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying in the good graces of your co-op board, and particularly becoming friendly with the board president, can short-circuit potential miscommunications and suspicions based on building gossip. The co-op board has the ultimate discretion to direct the building management in matters regarding the schedule and procedures around your renovation. And if you are hoping any exceptions will be made, neighborliness—to say nothing of cookies or Champagne—may help. Good luck navigating the co-op board to fulfill your renovation dreams!</span></p>

<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/renovation-101/process-guides/good-neighbors-heads-renovation-plans/">Reach out to your neighbors</a> before a renovation begins. Begin with a considerate letter and end with a glass of wine and a smile.</p>
