<h3>Appealing to the ideal renter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally when entrepreneur, we will call him AC, bought his apartment,  he intended to live there himself. However, after a few months, he decided it would make an even better investment property as a rental. To make it more renter-friendly, he wanted to enclose the upstairs loft. Doing so would convert the apartment into a two-bedroom —opening it up to a whole new market. He also wanted the design of the space to reflect the neighborhood vibe and attract young professionals with a modern aesthetic and lifestyle. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take on this rental property upgrade, he needed a professional for the renovation. </span></p>
<h3>Finding the renovation team</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/projects/44564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted his project</a> on </span><a href="https://app.sweeten.com/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeten</span></a> and hired <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3698#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this general contractor</a>. <span class="s1">Sweeten matches home renovation projects with vetted general contractors, offering guidance, tools, and support—for free..</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The contractor I found through Sweeten was great because he was very flexible with the changes to the scope of the work,” says AC. “Plus, the Sweeten team was accommodating and always on top of looking after my project.”</span></strong></p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>Choosing the finishes</h3>
<p>To appeal to young professionals, <span style="font-weight: 400;">AC chose on-trend luxe materials and finishes. He put in brass hardware that pops against the <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/blue-kitchen-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep-blue kitchen cabinets</a>. The cabinets weren’t originally this color, but AC knew that simply painting this rich hue would drastically change the look of the space. He was right. It went from drab to sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also made other smart paint choices. He brought the stair railing up-to-date with a new coat of paint and gave one of the bedrooms a masculine dark-blue accent wall. The bathroom was refreshed as well, adding interest with gray walls instead of plain white. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="double-vessel-sink-vanity-and-mirror"  class="alignnone wp-image-44286 mb-24 size-full" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2.jpg" alt="double glass vessel basin sink vanities with mirrors and granite countertop and dark bathroom walls after renovation" width="1000" height="1500" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2.jpg 1000w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Alfonso-Bathroom-Vanity-2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h3>Creating a second bedroom</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the renovation was more behind-the-scenes. The <a href="https://sweeten.com/gallery/reno-notebook/putting-walls-multifunctional-spaces-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newly-enclosed bedroom required</a> the electrical to be rewired and recessed lighting was added. They also changed the narrow hallway into a more useful space by configuring it as a small office area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AC’s advice to those thinking of renovation? “Just to be realistic,” he says. “With little changes, you can make a big impact.”</span></p>
<p><em>Thank you, AC, for sharing the results of your rental property upgrade.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Renovating former rental properties to become sources of comfort, instead of income</h2>
<p>No matter how well you take care of a home, things can be damaged accidentally or worn down over time. This is especially true when renovating former rental properties. Especially when tenants move in and out year after year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, homeowners need a break from the stress of renting a property. And sometimes, they&#8217;re ready to hang up their hats as landlords and update their former leasing properties to live in themselves. To take care of the wear and tear and to suit their needs and style, these homeowners turned to <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching renovators with vetted general contractors. Here are four renovation projects aimed at renovating former rental properties into forever homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-35590 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg" alt="manhattan renovation, bathroom renovation, vanity, walnut, open storage, round mirror, convert a rental into a primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SWEETEN-Sherry-Du-Apt-04.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>1.) Outdated Rental Property to Modern Apartment</h3>
<p>Sherry’s family purchased a Midtown East apartment in 2008. While they originally bought it as a rental property, <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/millennial-apartment-renovation-midtown-east/">Sherry decided to move in</a> just ten years later. However, it hadn’t been renovated since the ‘80s and had extensive water damage from a previous tenant. Still, the apartment had good bones (and space!). Her remodel involved replacing the flooring in every room. She also completely updated the kitchen and bathrooms to reflect her modern style.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-21360 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SWEETEN_John_Kitchen_Bathroon-06-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, kitchen, black and white" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Prewar Studio to Charming Apartment</h3>
<p>New York City’s housing market is full of prewar apartments with elaborate features. When Emily moved to the city, she was in search of just that: <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/a-longtime-rental-studio-gets-a-prewar-restoration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a charming apartment with original details</a>. Her six-month search ended with the purchase of a 1940s studio apartment.</p>
<p>The apartment had long been used as a rental property—and didn&#8217;t reflect its historical roots. She worked with her Sweeten general contractor to restore the apartment to its former glory. They installed beautiful crown molding and paneling throughout.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30008 size-chrono" title="bathroom" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_Ying_Apartment-03-723x1085.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence, bathroom" width="723" height="1085" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" /></a></p>
<h3>3.) Former Rental Property turned Uptown Retreat</h3>
<p>Ying and her parents’ Upper East Side apartment had seen many lives. <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/bathrooms/a-rental-studio-becomes-a-pied-a-terre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Originally purchased as an investment</a>, the owners and renters had lived in the apartment off and on. After the family hit their co-op’s rental limit, they decided to reimagine the space as a second home. The family added new flooring, paint, lighting, custom built-ins, and an overhauled bathroom.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-30242 size-chrono" title="kitchen" src="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg" alt="convert a rental into primary residence" width="723" height="482" data-overlay-text="" data-overlay-color="" srcset="https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-723x482.jpg 723w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-585x390.jpg 585w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01-600x400.jpg 600w, https://sweeten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SWEETEN_JoanneGalik_Kitchen-Bath-Store01.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<h3>4.) Updated Urban Residence</h3>
<p>After renting out their Manhattan property for over a decade, JoAnn and Brian were ready to call the <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-becomes-a-cozy-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban residence their permanent home</a>. The couple was leaving behind a six-bedroom house in New Jersey for this mid-town one-bedroom. With that said, they needed an efficient space. That meant an emphasis on storage in the main living areas and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom had also seen better days. The couple completely redid the two spaces while sticking to the original layout.</p>

(Above) <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/a-rental-in-a-brownstone-gets-fashionable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rental renovation</a> by Sweeten homeowner Bellamy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The process of renovating a rental property, whether it’s a summer house or an apartment building, is not so vastly different from renovating your own home, but with a lot more emphasis on budget and cost considerations. You want to invest enough in the property to be able to glean higher rent, keep it in line with market values, and hopefully, save yourself from having expensive repairs. <a href="https://www.compass.com/agents/brett-frank?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Frank</a>, a licensed real estate salesperson with Compass, said that “based on experience and conversations with other brokers, a 15 percent premium can be made on a renovated apartment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since your rental property is a source of income, the key is to concentrate on the right finishes, durable products and materials, and quick project completion. “You want the apartment to look good so you can get more money for it, but, while it’s empty and being remodeled, you’re not getting any rent,” pointed out <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Noam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here, <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten</a>, a free service matching homeowners with vetted general contractors, offers insight into the whys and hows of renovating your rental property.</p>
<p><strong>Meshing with the neighbors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renters will be less discerning with a two-week vacation rental than with a place they want to call home for a much longer time. But, that said, you don’t want to spend time constantly on the maintenance track. “You want to do the right thing and not just a cheap, cosmetic solution,” Noam said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So before you jump into renovating, do your homework. “Look at what other neighborhood rentals are receiving for rent, and which ones are getting top dollar,” said <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron, a contractor with Sweeten</a>. In particular, “look at the finish details and see what’s different from one to the other.” A local realtor or broker can help you make comparisons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And unless you’re a handy DIYer or just doing a quick spruce up—new hardware, updated lighting, fresh paint—hire a licensed contractor with experience in rental properties. He/she will not only have the construction chops but may also have insight into tenant issues.</p>
<p><strong>The right colors</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to paint, the least expensive thing to do is make everything white—or at the very least, the same color everywhere, suggests <a href="https://app.sweeten.com/members/2803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten contractor Mark</a>, “You can get a better price from your contractor because you won’t have the extra &#8216;cutting-in&#8217; time (painting the trim a different color than the walls),” he says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the whole apartment or house should be neat and clean, with everything up to code and in working condition, it’s the kitchen and bathrooms that renters, just like home buyers, will focus on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the kitchen, in terms of color, <a href="https://www.bhhsnyproperties.com/real-estate-agent/133/christine-fields" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine Fields</a>, licensed salesperson, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Properties, said she’s seeing a lot of rentals done in Navaho White by Benjamin Moore. “It’s a warm white, not glaring or gray but a welcoming paint color.” But, Aaron, cautioned, “Keep in mind that very light kitchens can be challenging to maintain, and down the road, they can discolor more easily.” <a href="https://sweeten.com/before-after/entire-homes/historic-rowhouse-wreck-renters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeten homeowners Jerry and Janet</a> had renovated their Brooklyn kitchen in neutral-yet-graphic shades of gray, black, and white, with an eye toward <a href="https://www.compass.com/listing/798-lincoln-place-unit-1-brooklyn-ny-11216/faea3f2b0489b4612cfc10d50e3b549855b463cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renting out their brownstone home</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Install drywall and paint the walls in the bathroom and “only do tile in the shower and on the floor to save money,” Sweeten contractor Mark said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For high traffic rooms like kitchens and bathrooms, specify high-gloss or semi-gloss paint since the higher the shine, the easier it is to clean and maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Main materials</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With elements like cabinets, counters, and vanities, opt for a clean aesthetic that’s up-to-date but also durable. You need to think of general wear-and-tear. Choose cabinet materials that are mid-grade, “a step above Ikea,” said Mark. While many homeowners go with Ikea cabinets, keep in mind that renters “will never pay the same attention to the care of materials and appliances as you would,” said Noam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although white kitchens are in style and “the overall perception is that they’re larger,” Aaron recommends “wood tones or darker” because of splatter or food stains. Stay away from glass cabinets, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For countertops and vanities, Aaron opts for quartz, although a bit pricier than other materials, “it’s a really resilient surface that looks great and will stand the test of time,” he said, &#8220;plus people are really looking for that marble-look quartz.” Granite, too, is a good choice, but it does need some maintenance and right now, at least, he feels it’s a bit dated. A subway tile backsplash is a classic look that will stand the test of time from a durability and aesthetic standpoint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you’re redoing the kitchen, make room for a dishwasher, even in the smallest of rental units. “If a prospective renter says they don’t care if they have a dishwasher, then they might be looking for a lower-priced rental,” said Aaron. And, if you’re changing out sinks, install an overmount sink because “it’s easier to maintain, and if you ever have to switch it out, it won’t affect the countertops or cabinet.” Overall, with kitchens, “think about their long-term use and work with your contractor to determine the lifetime value of the improvements,” Christine said.</p>
<p><strong>What’s underfoot?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, stay away from carpet. “Sometimes renters are grossed out by the idea of dirt and dust from previous tenants,” said Aaron. And it’s something you will have to clean, maintain and replace over time. Tenants can always use a throw rug to keep down noise or just to put a personal spin on the space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wood floors are a forgiving surface. With a natural color, scratches won’t show as much as with a dark floor, and natural stains are easy to keep up with. “A lot of people will go with an oil-based finish, which is a bit more resilient than a water-based finish,” Aaron said. But he cautions, “some condo and co-op buildings don’t allow it because of odors while the stain is drying.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the bathroom, porcelain tile is the best bet. Use a medium or light gray grout versus white because, over time, white will yellow and look dirty. Mark explained that for rentals, the average cost per square foot for tile might be $2 to $3, whereas a homeowner might pay $5 to $12 a square. “These costs add up when you start tiling multiple bathrooms or kitchen floors,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While you’re working in the bathroom, Christine said, “if the tub is old and has rust, cracks, chips in the porcelain or is just plain unsightly, have it skim coated or resurfaced. It will transform an old tub to look new and clean.”</p>
<p><strong>Other considerations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you own an apartment (or apartments) in a building, you’ll need to sign an alteration agreement. This basically makes sure that communal services and structures aren’t affected by a construction project in one apartment. You’ll need to build in time for approval from building management and may also have to factor in reserving the elevator along with other timelines that relate to building management (if you don’t own the building).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, in some instances, the work done may have to be ADA compliant. For example, if your property is on the first floor or will be new construction and is in a building with a certain number of units, it might mean that you will have to comply with ADA rules. Real estate salesperson, Brett, suggests you talk with someone at the Department of Buildings (with whom you have to file a plan), a building code expert, land-use attorney, urban planner or licensed architect for more information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s not really a set list of elements that would make a prospective tenant turn away. “Everyone wants different things,” Christine said. “What’s important to renters is a well-laid out space that they feel comfortable in. They want light and some views—and storage space—but they may be willing to forego those for something that fits better with their budget or offers more space, or a building that has more amenities.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you’re a project manager, some of this could be way out of your comfort zone, so it&#8217;s essential to find a good general contractor to help you through the entire process. Understanding what to renovate and the best materials for your rental will bring you closer to better and happier tenants with less maintenance and more money for you.</p>
